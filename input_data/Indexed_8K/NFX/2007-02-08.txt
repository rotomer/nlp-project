(February 7, 2007)  Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX)
http://www.newfield.com
          Today, Newfield's Board of Directors established March 5, 2007 as the record date for the Company's 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. The annual meeting will be held at 11 a.m., Central Daylight Time, on Thursday, May 3, 2007, in the Joe B. Foster Employee Communications Room, fourth floor, 363 N. Sam Houston Parkway E., Houston, Texas.
Highlights:
 
2007 Capital Budget
          Newfield's Board of Directors today approved a 2007 capital budget of approximately $1.8 billion. The Company's investment plan reflects the large development projects underway. Approximately $290 million of the budget is dedicated to exploration. The balance of the program is for exploitation drilling, development projects and maintenance of the property base. The budget includes about $50 million in continuing hurricane repairs in the Gulf of Mexico and excludes approximately $99 million of capitalized interest and overhead.
Fourth Quarter 2006
          For the fourth quarter of 2006, Newfield reported net income of $82 million, or $0.64 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Earnings for the quarter reflect the impact of the following items:
          Without the effects of the above items, net income for the quarter would have been $112 million, or $0.86 per share.
          Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $427 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $308 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
          By comparison, Newfield's net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $184 million, or $1.43 per share. Net income in this period was affected by the following items:
 
          Without the effects of these items, net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 would have been $85 million, or $0.66 per share. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $443 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $282 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. See
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
          Newfield's production in the fourth quarter of 2006 was 67.9 Bcfe. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005. Domestic production in the fourth quarter of 2005 was negatively impacted by an estimated 16 Bcfe of deferred production related to the 2005 hurricanes.
 
 
     Stated on a unit of production basis, Newfield's LOE in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1.80 per Mcfe, compared to $1.09 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2005. LOE was impacted by $0.73 per Mcfe due to the timing of expenditures related to hurricane repairs. A $34 million credit was recorded to LOE in the third quarter of 2006 related to the difference between the insurance proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims related to the 2005 hurricanes and actual repair costs to date. Production and other taxes in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $0.27 per Mcfe compared to $0.45 per Mcfe in the same period of 2005. DD&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $2.80 per Mcfe compared to $2.34 per Mcfe in the same period of 2005. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $0.45 per Mcfe compared to $0.56 per Mcfe in the same period of 2005. G&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $16 million. Capitalized direct internal costs were $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $557 million.
Full-Year 2006
     For 2006, Newfield posted net income of $591 million, or $4.58 per share, on revenues of $1.7 billion. Earnings for the year reflect the impact of the following items:
     Without the effect of the above items, net income for 2006 would have been $452 million, or $3.50 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.3 billion. See
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
     As a comparison, Newfield posted net income for 2005 of $348 million, or $2.73 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Earnings for 2005 reflect the impact of the following items:
 
     Without the effect of these items, net income for 2005 would have been $468 million, or $3.66 per share. "See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
     In 2006, Newfield produced 242.6 Bcfe. Production in 2005 totaled 241.6 Bcfe. Domestic production in 2006 and 2005 reflects the deferral of approximately 16 Bcfe and 22 Bcfe, respectively, related to the 2005 hurricanes and associated on-going repairs. The following tables detail production and average realized prices for 2006 and 2005:
 
 
and 2005, respectively. Without the effects of any hedging contracts, the average realized price for 2006 would have been $6.42 per Mcf for gas and $59.13 per Bbl for oil and condensate.
     LOE in 2006 averaged $1.14 per Mcfe compared to $0.85 per Mcfe in 2005. LOE was negatively impacted in 2006 by continuing hurricane repairs. Newfield's actual hurricane related repair expenses for 2006 exceeded the proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims related to the 2005 hurricanes by $17 million, or $0.07 per Mcfe. Production taxes in 2006 were $0.25 per Mcfe compared to $0.26 per Mcfe in 2005. DD&A expense in 2006 was $2.57 per Mcfe compared to $2.15 per Mcfe in 2005. G&A expense in 2006 was $0.51 per Mcfe compared to $0.43 per Mcfe in the prior year. G&A expense in 2006 is net of capitalized direct internal costs of $58 million compared to $46 million in 2005.
Proved Reserves and Capital Activity
     Newfield's total reserves at year-end 2006 were 2.3 Tcfe, an increase of 14% over year-end 2005 reserves. Reserve additions from all sources were 603 Bcfe with only 1 Bcfe of the total coming from purchases of properties. Reserves associated with properties sold in 2006 totaled 13 Bcfe.
Oil and Gas Reserves*
 
*       These estimates were prepared by Newfield. As a requirement of Newfield's credit facility, independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least 70% of the present value of Newfield's proved reserves. For December 31, 2006, the independent reserve engineers' reports covered properties representing 83% of Newfield's proved reserves, and for such properties the reserves were within 4% of the reserves Newfield reported for such properties.
Capital Expenditures
 
 
First Quarter 2007 Estimates
     The Company's natural gas production in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 48  53 Bcf (533  588 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Company's Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70 - - $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
     The Company's oil production, including international liftings, in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 1.9  2.2 million barrels (21,000  24,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 2,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13  15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
     LOE is expected to be $58  $64 million ($0.90  $0.99 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2007. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be $19  $21 million ($0.29  $0.33 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
     G&A expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $34  $38 million ($0.53  $0.59 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $13.6  $15 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Company's incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
General and Administrative Expense
     The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $14.5  $16.5 million ($0.23  $0.26 per Mcfe). As of February 1, 2007, Newfield had no outstanding borrowings under its credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1,175 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $10  $11 million.
Interest Expense
     Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2007 to be about 35  38%. About 76-84% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
Income Taxes

     Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
     A reconciliation of earnings for the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
     A reconciliation of earnings for 2006 and 2005 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Newfield has three large development projects underway that will add significant production volumes in 2007. A brief update on each is found below.
Wrigley, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
Our deepwater Wrigley Field is being prepared for first production. The well has been completed and tested at 62 MMcf/d in early January. We are awaiting final hurricane repairs to the outside operated Cognac facility. Once repairs are complete, our production modules will be welded in place and will allow for our gas production. We operate Wrigley with a 50% working interest.
Grove, U.K North Sea
In the North Sea, production from our Grove Field has been delayed due to severe weather conditions. We recently drilled the #7 development well in the eastern portion of the field's central fault block. The pay zones were thinner and tighter than expected and reduced our estimate of net recoverable reserves for the field by 17 Bcfe. We are the operator of Grove with an 85% interest.
Abu, Offshore Malaysia
The platform for our Abu Field was installed in late 2006 and the floating, storage and offloading vessel will soon be commissioned. In addition, we continue to focus on our development of the Puteri Field on PM 318 and the East Belumut and Chermingat Fields on PM 323.
FOCUS AREA UPDATES
The following table summarizes our 2006 drilling activity by region.
 
2007 CAPITAL BUDGET
Our 2007 capital budget is $1.8 billion, about the same as our 2006 spending. This year's budget reflects the large development projects underway and the high level of activity in our focus areas. The total includes $290 million for exploration, down about 20% from 2006 exploration investments. The balance of the program is for exploitation drilling, development projects and maintenance of the property base. We have included about $50 million in continuing hurricane repairs in the Gulf of Mexico.
Estimated 2007 Capital Investments, by region
(in millions)
 
MID-CONTINENT
In the fourth quarter, the Mid-Continent region completed 57 successful wells with no dry holes. For the year 2006, the Mid-Continent region completed 332 wells (gross) with four dry holes. In 2007, the Mid-Continent will be the Company's largest investment region with a planned budget of $700 million. We expect to drill approximately 300 wells, with about half of the wells in the Woodford Shale Play. We are running 20 operated rigs at this time.
: Since late 2005, we have spudded 57 horizontal wells in the Woodford Shale Play. Current production is approximately 90 MMcfe/d (gross). We have 13 operated rigs running in the play, with 10 of them dedicated to horizontal drilling. We expect that number to climb to about 15 rigs late in the year. Our acreage in the play continues to expand and today we have interest in 130,000 net acres.
Woodford Shale
In late 2005, our drilling program shifted from vertical wells to horizontals. In addition, completion practices in the Woodford continue to evolve and results are encouraging. The most recent wells all have increased fracture stimulation densities with fracs spaced about every 500' along the lateral. Laterals lengths are today ranging from 2,000'  3,700' (2,500' is standard).
Of the 20 wells we have completed recently with increased frac densities, our early data indicates estimated reserve recoveries of more than 3 Bcf per well. We have several wells that had initial production of more than 10 MMcf/d and the top well reached 17 MMcfe/d (gross). We need an additional 45-60 days of production data to statistically validate reserve recovery estimates.
We are currently operating five drilling rigs in Wash Play of the Texas Panhandle, all in the Stiles Ranch Field. We entered this area through our 2002 acquisition of EEX Corp. At the time of the acquisition, field production was less than 3 MMcfe/d. In early 2003, we consolidated interests in the field and now have virtually 100%.
Texas Wash Play:
In 2006, we spudded 30 additional wells in the field. Current drilling is developing the field on 80-acre spacing. Recent success with a 40-acre pilot infill program could add an incremental 200 Bcfe of reserves through the drilling of an additional 180 locations. Plans for 2007 are to drill about 40 operated wells in Stiles Ranch. Current gross daily production in the Texas Wash is about 65 MMcfe/d.
ONSHORE GULF COAST
During the fourth quarter, our Onshore Gulf Coast team completed 14 successful wells out of 20 attempts. In 2006, the Onshore Gulf Coast region completed 78 total wells (gross) with 20 dry holes. In 2007, we plan to invest $345 million in this region and expect to drill approximately 70 wells. We have eight operated rigs running along the Gulf Coast and are participating in three outside-operated wells.
 
Under our joint venture with Exxon-Mobil in South Texas, we have drilled 12 successful wells to date. All of the wells are located in the Sarita Field in Kenedy County. Under this joint venture, we will operate 2-3 rigs throughout 2007 and have 20 ready-to-drill locations.
Sarita Field, South Texas:
Our recent B-83 well was drilled east of our B-75 discovery well and represents our most distant eastern success. The B-83 found 286' of high quality log pay. This well establishes new, deeper pay zones in the field. S.K. East B-82 is being completed and found 233' of net pay. The B-81 and B-79 are drilling.
In the Val Verde, our gross production reached a new high of 82 MMcfe/d in late 2006. We are expanding our operations into new areas, including Mayfield Ranch where we acquired a large 3-D seismic survey in 2006 and have drilled three successful wells to date.
Val Verde Basin:
We drilled the first horizontal well in the Geronimo Creek Field that had initial production of 7 MMcf/d. A second horizontal is drilling at this time.
The Guerra # D-9 well drilled in the La Reforma Field, found nearly 250' of net gas pay and is flowing at approximately 6 MMcf/d (gross). We have a 50% working interest.
Vicksburg:
We recently drilled our first well under the Exxon-Mobil JV that was located of our Sarita Field area. The Johnson #79 well is located in the S.E. McCook Field in Hidalgo County, Texas. The well is currently flowing at 8 MMcf/d. We have a 100% working interest in the well.
Monte Christo Field Area:
outside
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
In 2006, the Rocky Mountain region completed 199 total wells (gross) with five dry holes. In 2007,we plan to invest $135 million in this region and expect to drill approximately 150 wells with a three-rig program. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Rocky Mountain Team completed 44 successful wells and no dry holes.
During 2006, we nearly doubled our gross acreage position in the Uinta Basin through several joint ventures and alliances:
Recent agreement adds 47,000 gross acres located north of the Monument Butte Field. Prospective targets are an extension of sands in the Monument Butte Field and drilling is planned for 2007. We expect to drill a minimum of 12 wells per year in this new area.
Ute Indian Tribal Land:
Access to this 32,000 gross acre area located northeast of our Monument Butte Field was obtained through a joint venture with Kerr-McGee (Anadarko). We are drilling our third Green River well at this time.
Horseshoe Bend:
Through a JV with a private company in the area, we added 8,000 gross acres with prospective targets in shallow Green River horizons as well as deep gas prospects.
Ouray/Elk:
Over the last year, we've drilled 20 wells in the Monument Butte Field on 20-acre spacing. The results have exceeded expectations with initial production rates 60% greater than pre-drill planning.
GULF OF MEXICO
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we drilled 5 successful wells and no dry holes. In 2006, the Gulf of Mexico region completed 27 total wells (gross) with five dry holes. In 2007, we will invest $438 million in this region and expects to drill 15-20 wells in shallow water and 4-5 in deepwater.
Traditional Shelf Development Project Update
We have 15 developments underway in the shallow water Gulf that are expected to add about 85 MMcfe/d of "new" production in 2007.
 
Deepwater Highlights
In January, we reached an agreement with ATP Oil & Gas related to our Anduin deepwater discovery, located at Mississippi Canyon 754/755. The Anduin discovery, which seismic suggests covers both blocks, was made by Newfield and Nexen (operator) in February 2005. Under the agreement, ATP will acquire a 100% working interest in a portion of Mississippi Canyon 755. In exchange, we retained a production payment allowing for the full recovery of our sunk costs in the Anduin discovery to date. In addition, Newfield will retain a 3% net overriding royalty interest in Block 755. We will become operator of Mississippi Canyon 754  the "western half" of the Anduin discovery. ATP acquired the remaining 50% interest in the block. The terms of the agreement provide us with a production handling agreement concerning Mississippi Canyon 754 and providing for 4,000 BOPD of capacity through the adjacent Gomez development (Mississippi Canyon 711) beginning in January 2009. We expect to drill a well on this prospect in 2008. In addition, we obtained a production handling agreement for 4,000 BOPD associated with the potential development of its Gladden Prospect, located on Mississippi Canyon 800. A wildcat well is planned for mid-2007. We have a 60% operated interest in Gladden.
PowerPlay is a recent discovery being developed with operator Anadarko. Plans include a sub-sea tie back to Baldpate with first production expected in late 2008.
PowerPlay development (GB 258) 
We are planning to drill a development well in this field in the first half of 2007. First production expected in late 2008. Newfield has a 67% working interest.
Fastball development (VK 1003) 
An exploration test is planned for first half of 2007 on a 65 Bcfe shallow amplitude. The wildcat well will also test a deep exploratory prospect. We have a 25% operated interest.
Nemo (MC 29) 
Our deepwater and prospects are expected to be drilled around mid-year. These are 40-70 Bcfe prospects that would tie to area infrastructure and, if successful, lead to first production in 2008.
West Jacobs (MC 72)
Gladden (MC 800)
INTERNATIONAL
In the fourth quarter of 2006, our International team completed eight successful wells and two dry holes. In 2006, the international team completed 29 wells with three dry holes. In 2007, we have allocated $210 million to our international programs.
China
In Bohai Bay, we are producing about 11,000 BOPD (gross) from our two fields. We have an 18% interest through cost recovery and a 12% interest after cost recovery.
Malaysia
Our deepwater Talang Prospect, located on Block 2C, offshore Sarawak, reached its planned depth around year-end 2006. The well found 60 feet of non-commercial gas pay. We sold a third of our interest in the well on a promoted basis and retained a 53% cost interest. We are analyzing the information from the well and integrating this into our new interpretations. This was the first well of a two-well commitment on Block 2C.
 
North Sea
In the 24 Licensing Round, we were recently awarded three blocks: 47/9d, 48/12e and 48/30b. We have several prospects on this acreage that we plan to test in 2008-09.
th
FIRST QUARTER 2007 ESTIMATES
Our natural gas production in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 48  53 Bcf (533  588 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, we estimate that our realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40  $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for our Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70  $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
Our oil production, including international liftings, in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 1.9  2.2 million barrels (21,000  24,000 BOPD). We expect to produce approximately 2,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price we receive for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13  15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
LOE is expected to be $58  $64 million ($0.90  $0.99 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2007. Production taxes in the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be $19  $21 million ($0.29  $0.33 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
G&A expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $34  $38 million ($0.53  $0.59 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $13.6  $15 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
General and Administrative Expense
The non-capitalized portion of our interest expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $14.5  $16.5 million ($0.23  $0.26 per Mcfe).
