**These 3way collar contracts are standard crude oil collar contracts with respect to the periods, volumes and prices stated above. The contracts have floor and ceiling prices per barrel as per the table above until the price drops below a weighted average price of $29.23 per barrel. Below $29.23 per barrel, these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are on average $6.64 per barrel higher than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized.
The following table details the expected impact to pre-tax income from the settlement of our derivative contracts, outlined above, at various NYMEX oil prices, net of premiums paid for these contracts (in millions).
 
Our natural gas production in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 48  53 Bcf (533  588 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, we estimate that our realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40  $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for our Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handing charges, typically average $0.70  $0.80 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
FIRST QUARTER 2007 ESTIMATES
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
Our oil production, including international liftings, in the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be 1.9  2.2 million barrels (21,000  24,000 BOPD). We expect to produce approximately 2,200 BOPD from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price we receive for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price we receive for our production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13  15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
LOE is expected to be $88  $97 million ($1.39  $1.53 per Mcfe) in the first quarter of 2007. This includes approximately $32 million ($0.50 per Mcfe) of major expense (hurricane repairs to facilities, well workovers, etc.). Production taxes in the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be $19  $21 million ($0.29  $0.33 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
G&A expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $34  $38 million ($0.53  $0.59 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $13.6  $15 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in our incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
General and Administrative Expense
The non-capitalized portion of our interest expense for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be $14.5  $16.5 million ($0.23  $0.26 per Mcfe). As of February 1, 2007, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1,175 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $10  $11 million.
Interest Expense
Including both current and deferred taxes, we expect our consolidated income tax rate in the first quarter of 2007 to be about 35  38%. About 76-84% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
Income Taxes
The statements set forth in this publication regarding estimated or anticipated first quarter 2007 results and production volumes are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, tax rates, the level of workover activity, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources, labor conditions and other factors set forth in Newfield's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. Estimated expenses on a per unit basis will be impacted by variances between actual and projected production. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to numerous operating risks.
The Company provides information regarding its outstanding hedging positions in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and in its electronic publication  @NFX.
