     For the first quarter of 2007, Newfield reported a net loss of $96 million, or $0.75 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The results reflect the impact of the following items:
     Without the effects of the above items, net income for the quarter would have been $119 million, or $0.92 per share. Earnings for the quarter include $36 million of hurricane related repair expenses. Revenues in the first quarter of 2007 were $440 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $346 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
     Newfield's production in the first quarter of 2007 was 64.7 Bcfe.
Operational Highlights
 
     "We're off to a good start in 2007 with a success in the deepwater Gulf and continued success in our onshore regions  South Texas, the Mid-Continent and the Rockies," said David A. Trice, Newfield Chairman, President and CEO. "Throughout 2006 and early 2007, we suffered delays with large development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and overseas. We are days away from bringing two new developments on-line  Grove in the North Sea and Wrigley in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. With certainty on the timing of these developments, we are now able to issue an expected range of production for 2007. We have growth in all of our operating regions and our teams will continue to work hard to deliver on our promises."
     The following table outlines Newfield's expected range of production by area for 2007.
 
Second Quarter 2007 Estimates
     The Company's natural gas production in the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be 53  58 Bcf (582  643 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40  $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Company's Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75  85% of the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
     The Company's oil production, including international liftings, in the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be 2.1  2.3 million barrels (23,000  26,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 2,700 BOPD net from its Malaysian operations and approximately 2,100 BOPD net from its China operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia and China may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13  $15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Oil Production from China typically sells at $10  $12 per barrel less than WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
     LOE is expected to be $97  $107 million ($1.40  $1.55 per Mcfe) in the second quarter of 2007. This includes major expense of $15 million related to hurricane related repairs in the Gulf of Mexico. It is anticipated that hurricane repairs will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter. Production taxes in the second quarter of 2007 are expected to be $23  $25 million ($0.33  $0.37 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
 
     G&A expense for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be $33  $37 million ($0.48  $0.53 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $13  $15 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Company's incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
General and Administrative Expense
     The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be $21  $23 million ($0.30  $0.34 per Mcfe). As of April 25, 2007, Newfield had $245 million outstanding under its credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1,175 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $10  $11 million.
Interest Expense
     Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the second quarter of 2007 to be about 35  38%. About 85  95% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
     Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
     A reconciliation of earnings for the first quarter of 2007 and 2006 stated without the effect of certain items to net income (loss) is shown below:
 
     Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

This edition of @NFX includes:
Fastball Development (Viosca Knoll 1003)
Fastball found approximately 90' of net gas pay, exceeding pre-drill expectations. The well will be developed with a sub-sea tie to one of several existing fields in the area. The sub-sea tree for this development has been set and first production is expected in late 2008/early 2009. Newfield has a 67% interest.
The following table outlines Newfield's expected range of production by area for 2007.
2007 Production Guidance
 
 
FOCUS AREA UPDATES
In the first quarter, the Mid-Continent region completed 41 successful wells with no dry holes. For 2007, we expect to drill approximately 300 wells, with about half in the Woodford Shale Play. We are running 20 operated rigs in the Mid-Continent at this time.
MID-CONTINENT
Over the last year, gross daily production in the Woodford has quadrupled from 25 MMcfe/d to a current rate of approximately 110 MMcfe/d. Newfield is now operating 14 of the 40 industry rigs in the Woodford and remains the most active driller. Our acreage in the play continues to expand and today we have interest in approximately 137,000 net acres.
Woodford Shale
To date, the industry has spud more than 200 horizontal wells in the Woodford. Newfield has spud more than 80 of these wells. After experimentation with different drilling and completion techniques, the Company has "standardized" its well designs in the play. Recent wells have 5 fracture stimulation stages across a 2,500' lateral. Results point to better production rates and increased estimated reserve recoveries. Horizontal well costs have fluctuated during their evolution as we used data to determine the "model" Woodford Shale well that delivered the lowest per unit development costs.
Woodford Shale Economics
Here is some historical information regarding horizontal drilling, well costs and estimated recoveries:
In May 2006, we hosted an analyst/shareholder meeting in Tulsa, OK. At that time, the average well cost was approximately $4 to $4.5 million (gross). Our definition of a standard well at the time was a 2,500' lateral with a three-stage frac. We estimated that the wells would recover 2.5  3 Bcfe (gross). Drilling and completion costs have risen since May 2006. We had less than 10 wells in our data set at the time of this initial estimate. We have a sample set now with more than 25 wells with three-stage fracs and at
Mid-2006:
In today's dollars, we estimate that this horizontal well would cost $4.8 to $5 million (gross).
 
least 180 days of production. From this data, we believe that a 2,500' lateral with a three-stage frac will recover approximately 2.5 Bcfe (gross).
we experimented with longer lateral lengths (as long as 3,700'). The higher well costs were not justified by reserve recoveries. We returned to a 2,500' lateral and increased frac densities from three to five stages  or a frac every 500' along the lateral. Adding two additional frac stages increased well costs by about $800,000 (gross).
In the second half of 2006,
We now have a data set of over 30 wells with increased frac densities and the estimated reserve recoveries are significantly higher. We have redefined our "standard" well. Current costs to drill a 2,500' lateral with five frac stages is approximately . EUR's have increased to .
April 2007:
$5.5  $6 million (gross)
3 to 3.4 Bcf (gross)
Newfield remains in the assessment phase and well costs include approximately $200,000 of "science costs," including experimentation and investments in new drilling technologies, mud systems, bits, steerables, etc. In addition, only one well per 640-acre section is being drilled at this time. In the development phase, the "science" costs will disappear and synergies will be gained through the proximity of drilling operations.
 
Summary:
 
 
By year end, nearly all of our acreage will be held by production and our drilling in the Woodford Shale will enter the development phase. As our development program matures, we estimate that we will drill 8 -16 wells per section with an average estimated cost per well lowering to approximately $5 million (gross). These lower costs come from the elimination of $200,000 of "science" and remote location costs. This also includes economies of scale and efficiencies, including the use of pad drilling, simultaneous fracs, common water handling and an established and shared road system.
2008 and Beyond:
The Company believes it can add 3  3.4 Bcfe (gross) for $5 million (gross) in drill and completion costs (in today's service cost environment). This equates to an ultimate finding and development cost of approximately $2 per Mcfe. Our net reserve potential from the Woodford Shale play is 3  6 Tcfe.
The Woodford Shale Play is in close proximity to several natural gas pipeline systems (Centerpoint, Enogex and Ozark) which allows multiple marketing options. The Company estimates that its realized gas price in the Woodford will be 75-85% of the Henry Hub Index after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges.
We are currently operating six drilling rigs in the Wash Play of the Texas Panhandle, all in the Stiles Ranch Field, Wheeler County, Texas.
Texas Wash Play
In late 2006, we began drilling development wells from pads. The wells are 10 feet apart on the surface and are directionally drilled on 40-acre spacing. The rig is skidded from well to well on a rail system. Once drilled, the wells are fractured stimulated and completed simultaneously. The economies of scale from pad drilling result in lower costs and better capital efficiency. We plan to drill 35-40 wells at Stiles Ranch with two-thirds of those wells being drilled from common well site pads.
In the Stiles Ranch area, we currently hold 10,400 gross acres across about 16 sections. Our working interest is predominantly 100% in 12 of the sections. To date, 79 deep Wash wells have been spud and 65
 
are on-line. At the end of 2007, we will have 180 locations remaining on 40-acre spacing. Our gross operated daily production in the Texas Wash is 65 MMcfe/d.
During the first quarter, our Onshore Gulf Coast Division completed 16 wells with one dry well. We currently have seven operated rigs running along the Gulf Coast and are participating in five outside-operated wells.
ONSHORE GULF COAST
Under our joint venture with Exxon-Mobil in South Texas, we have drilled 15 successful wells to date. All of the wells are located in the Sarita Field in Kenedy County. Under this joint venture, we expect to operate 2-3 rigs throughout 2007.
Sarita Field, South Texas:
Our recent Sarita B-83 well established new, deeper pay zones in the field and tested at 24 MMcf/d (gross). It was drilled to the east of our B-75 discovery and represents our most distant eastern success to date. The well sets up additional development locations.
Also in mid-April, the Sarita B-87 reached a total depth of 16,500' and encountered more than 700' of net gas pay  a record. This well sets up at least three offset drilling locations.
On the Mayfield Ranch acreage covering more than 16,000 acres, we drilled four successful wells out of five attempts.
Val Verde Basin:
In the Poulter Field, located in Terrell County, Texas, the Poulter 3404 recently logged approximately 80' of net pay in the Strawn Limestone and is today testing at 5.4 MMcfe/d (gross). This well extends the boundaries of the field. Current Poulter Field production is 33 MMcf/d. Newfield operates the field with a 60% working interest.
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
We continue to be encouraged by the production from our 20-acre infill development wells at Monument Butte. Year-to-date, we've drilled 14 successful wells and now have 21 wells on-line associated with this program. Initial production rates have exceeded our expectations at approximately 170 BOPD (gross).
During the first quarter, the Rocky Mountain Division completed 41 wells. Under a four-rig program, we plan to drill approximately 200 wells in the Monument Butte Field in 2007.
In 2007, Newfield signed several joint ventures and alliances that nearly doubled the Company's acreage position in the Uinta Basin. These include:
Ute Indian Tribal Nation  a 47,000 acre joint venture. Their acreage is located north of Monument Butte. Drilling is currently underway with plans to drill 12-18 shallow Green River wells in 2007.
Horseshoe Bend, northeast of Monument Butte, includes approximately 32,000 gross acres. Current plans include drilling of four Green River wells.
Ouray/Gusher, northeast of Monument Butte, includes approximately 8,000 gross acres. We are currently drilling a deep Mesa Verde test well in the area.
GULF OF MEXICO
Gulf of Mexico production is now approximately 290 MMcfe/d, or nearly the same level of production prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (August/September 2005). Total Gulf of Mexico volumes for 2007 are expected to total 95  100 Bcfe net.
In the first quarter of 2007, the Gulf of Mexico region completed nine total wells with two dry holes. In 2007, we plan to drill 12-15 traditional shelf wells and two to three deepwater wells.
 
In addition to Wrigley, we have two deepwater developments underway  PowerPlay and Fastball.
DEEPWATER
PowerPlay is a discovery being developed with operator Anadarko. Plans include a sub-sea tie back to Baldpate with first production expected in late 2008.
PowerPlay development (GB 258) 
(described on page 1) is will be sub-sea tied to an existing field with first production in late 2008/early 2009. Newfield has a 67% interest.
Fastball
Production is preparing to commence in the Newfield-operated Wrigley Field. The field is expected to produce approximately 50 MMcfe/d (gross). We operate Wrigley with a 50% working interest.
Wrigley 
We recently spud an exploration test on our Nemo Prospect which has a shallow amplitude-supported target, as well as a deep Miocene exploration target. We have a 25% operated interest.
Nemo (MC 29) 
We have developments either on-line or underway in the shallow water Gulf that should add more than 80 MMcfe/d of production in 2007.
TRADITIONAL SHELF DEVELOPMENT PROJECT UPDATES
INTERNATIONAL
Our Grove Field is preparing to commence production. We are the operator of Grove with an 85% interest. Our plans are to conduct flow assurance work and gather reservoir data over a period of several weeks. Following this work, we expect to curtail field production to approximately 10 MMcfe/d due to low natural gas prices. The Grove Field is capable of producing 60 MMcfe/d (gross) and production will increase when gas prices improve.
North Sea
We drilled two dry holes in the North Sea in early 2007  Auburn and West Cutter. The Seven Seas prospect is currently drilling. Our cost interests in these wells is substantially carried by another company.
The platform for our Abu Field was installed in late 2006 and the floating, storage and offloading vessel has been moored. We expect to commence production late in the second quarter of 2007. Production will ramp up to approximately 15,000 BOPD (gross). At current oil prices, we will have net revenue interest in the Abu Field of approximately 35%. Also, development continues at the Puteri Field on PM 318 and the East Belumut and Chermingat Fields on PM 323. Puteri will be on production in late 2007 or early 2008 and will be produced through existing
Malaysia
 
facilities. The East Belumut and Chermingat Fields are Newfield-operated and are expected on-line in 2008. We have an inventory of drilling ideas on both our PM 318 and 323 blocks.
SECOND QUARTER 2007 ESTIMATES
The Company's natural gas production in the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be 53  58 Bcf (582  643 MMcf/d). Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40  $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Realized gas prices for the Company's Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75  85% of the Henry Hub Index. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Company's oil production, including international liftings, in the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be 2.1  2.3 million barrels (23,000  26,000 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 2,700 BOPD net from its Malaysian operations and approximately 2,100 BOPD net from its China operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia and China may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13  $15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00  $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Oil Production from China typically sells at $10  $12 per barrel less than WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
LOE is expected to be $97  $107 million ($1.40  $1.55 per Mcfe) in the second quarter of 2007. This includes major expense of $15 million related to hurricane related repairs in the Gulf of Mexico. It is anticipated that hurricane repairs will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter. Production taxes in the second quarter of 2007 are expected to be $23  $25 million ($0.33  $0.37 per Mcfe). These expenses vary and are subject to impact from, among other things, production volumes and commodity pricing, tax rates, service costs, the costs of goods and materials and workover activities.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
G&A expense for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be $33  $37 million ($0.48  $0.53 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $13  $15 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation expense depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Company's incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives.
General and Administrative Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Company's interest expense for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be $21  $23 million ($0.30  $0.34 per Mcfe). As of April 25, 2007, Newfield had $245 million outstanding under its credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of four separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1,175 million in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the second quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $10  $11 million.
Interest Expense
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the second quarter of 2007 to be about 35  38%. About 85  95% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
