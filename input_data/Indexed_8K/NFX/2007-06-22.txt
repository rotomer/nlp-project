Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 22, 2007, Newfield Exploration Company (the Company) entered into a new $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement) to replace its previous $1 billion facility. The Credit Agreement, dated as of June 22, 2007, is among the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and issuing bank.
Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Companys option, based on (a) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System during the last preceding business day plus 50 basis points or (b) a base Eurodollar rate substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurodollar liabilities, plus a margin that is based on a grid of our debt rating (87.5 basis points per annum at June 22, 2007). All other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are substantially the same as those of the prior credit facility.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
