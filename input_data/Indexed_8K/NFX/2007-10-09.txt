Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. The Company relies on a proven strategy of growing reserves through the drilling of a balanced risk/reward portfolio and select acquisitions. Newfield's domestic areas of operation include the onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko and Arkoma Basins of the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Company has international operations in Malaysia and China.
 
****Production guidance for 2007 and 2008 is forward looking information that is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from guidance due to many factors including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil Newfield produces from its Monument Butte Field in Utah and labor conditions. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks. Completion of additional divestitures is subject to Newfield reaching terms with buyers that it considers acceptable and to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
