FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Houston - October 24, 2007 -
Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX)
today reported third quarter financial and operating results. Newfield will be hosting its third quarter results conference call at 8:30 a.m. (CDST) on October 25. To participate in the call dial 719-457-2680 or listen through the website at

.
For the third quarter of 2007, Newfield reported net income of $83 million, or $0.64 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The results reflect the impact of commodity derivative expense of $26 million ($17 million after tax), or $0.12 per share, associated with unrealized changes in the fair market value of open derivative contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting. Without the effect of unrealized commodity derivative expense, net income for the quarter would have been $100 million, or $0.76 per share.
Revenues (including operations in the U.K. North Sea which for financial reporting purposes have been presented as discontinued operations) in the third quarter of 2007 were $424 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $288 million. See
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
found after the financial statements in this release.
Newfields production in the third quarter of 2007 was 61 Bcfe, which includes approximately 1 Bcfe from the U.K. North Sea.
Highlights
 
Capital Expenditures
During the third quarter, Newfield invested $477 million. Year-to-date, Newfield has invested $1.5 billion, excluding the $577 million acquisition of Rocky Mountain assets from Stone Energy. Including the acquisition, Newfield expects its full-year 2007 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.5 billion.
Fourth Quarter 2007 Estimates
 
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be 38 - 42 Bcf (415 - 455 MMcf/d). Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75 - 85% of the Henry Hub Index. Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Although Newfields Rocky Mountains production is primarily oil, the Company does produce approximately 40 MMcfe/d of natural gas in this region. Recent basis differentials have widened dramatically. Newfield hedged the basis differential associated with 50% of the expected production from the proved producing fields acquired from Stone Energy in the second quarter of 2007. The basis hedges cover the second half of 2007 through 2012 at a weighted average hedged differential of $(1.18) per Mcf. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million barrels (14,130 - 16,300 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 5,200 BOPD (net) from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13 - $15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $40 - $45 million ($0.82 - $0.93 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2007. With the recent divestiture of the Companys Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets, the major expense portion of LOE is expected to drop significantly. The LOE projection for the fourth quarter includes major expense of approximately $3 million. The drop in LOE per Mcfe will be partially offset by an increase in production taxes per Mcfe now that a significant portion of the Companys production is onshore and subject to severance taxes. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2007 are expected to be $32 - $36 million ($0.66 - $0.75 per Mcfe). Approximately one-third of the production taxes are associated with Newfields Malaysian operations.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be $46 - $51 million ($0.96 - $1.06 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $21 - $23 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense, which depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. The gain associated with the sale of the U.K. business will increase adjusted net income and result in additional fourth quarter G&A expense of approximately $17 million.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be $20 - $22 million ($0.41 - $0.45 per Mcfe). As of October 24, 2007, Newfield had no borrowings outstanding under its credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1.05 billion in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $8 - $9 million.
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 to be about 35 - 38%. About 65% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:

RECENT ACTIVITIES
 
NFX Places High Bid on 18 Blocks in GOM Lease Sale
We bid on 32 blocks in the most recent lease sale and had the apparent winning bid on 18. We ranked 21 of the 84 companies bidding at the Central Gulf of Mexico Sale 205, held by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) in New Orleans on October 3. Our net exposure on the high bids is $35 million.
In deepwater, we acquired blocks in Garden Banks, Mississippi Canyon and Atwater Valley that contain a balanced portfolio of sub-salt, foldbelt and amplitude prospects. We have a deepwater drilling plan scheduled for 2008 and are evaluating these recently acquired blocks for our 2009-10 drilling program. We have a deep inventory of drilling prospects in deepwater. This inventory will allow us to drill 3-4 wells per year for the next several years.
Asset Divestitures
The asset sales process we embarked on during 2007 has been very successful, generating proceeds of more than $1.8 billion. Proceeds were at the upper end of our pre-sale expectations. The table below summarizes each transaction.
The asset sales to date represent approximately 420 Bcfe of our year-end 2006 proved reserves. We expect to exit 2007 with a very strong capital structure. Our debt/market capitalization ratio will be around 20% and we will have nearly $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the second quarter, the availability under our revolver was increased to $1.25 billion.
Summary of asset divestitures:
 
 
FOCUS AREA UPDATES
 
Third Quarter 2007 Drilling Activity
 
Year-to-date 2007 Drilling Activity
 
MID-CONTINENT
In the Mid-Continent region, we expect to spud approximately 155 wells during 2007.  We are currently operating 18 rigs in the area.
Woodford Shale Play
Gross daily production in the Woodford Shale is
approximately
 
150
MMcfe/d
. Since last October, our Woodford production is up 150% from 60 MMcfe/d gross.
We are
currently
operating 13 of the 4
4
industry rigs
active
in the Woodford
Shale play today
and remain the most active driller.
We have drilled 108 vertical wells, 134 horizontal wells and have participated in 222 of the industrys 375 wells drilled to date.
We currently have an interest in more than 155,000
net
acres. The majority of our acreage in our core footprint area is now held by production.
We anticipate drilling as many as 3,000 wells across our acreage. To help determine the most optimal well spacing for full-field development, we are drilling six pilots across our acreage to test both 40-acre and 80-acre spacing patterns.
Our first Pilot, the Cattle, has been on-line for more than 70 days. We are encouraged that production rates are comparable to wells drilled on 640-acre spacing.
Wells in the Cattle Pilot were drilled from single pad locations. Our four Cattle wells were drilled at or below their pre-drill estimates and came in between $5.5 million and $5.7 million gross. Drilling the wells from a common pad would have eliminated additional drilling and completion costs. Our drilling team is now moving to multiple wells drilled from a common pad site - just as we are routinely doing in our Stiles Ranch Field in the Anadarko Basin.
Our second Woodford pilot, the Whitlow, also includes four wells on 40-acre spacing. Two of the wells share a common pad, and the other two were on single pads. We will have production rates from this pilot in the next several weeks.
 
Drilling is now underway on our third pilot -- the Morris. At the Morris, three wells are being drilled from a common pad. We expect to realize significant cost savings from common pads. Location construction costs should go down by $100,000 per well, the elimination of rig moves should save about $80,000 per well and completion costs should drop by $350,000 through the use of a common frac site.
 
Texas Wa
s
h Play
We are running five rigs in the Stiles Ranch Field, located in the Texas Panhandle. Three of the rigs are drilling from common pads designed to support multiple wells. We currently hold 11,840 gross
 
acres and our working interest is predominantly 100%. 
Production at Stiles Ranch is lumpy and reflects pad drilling operations and the timing of turning multiple wells to sales simultaneously. Gross production is approximately 55 MMcfe/d. We have approximately 200 locations left to drill on 40-acre spacing.
We plan to drill 40-45 wells at Stiles Ranch during 2007 with two-thirds of those wells being drilled from common pads.
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
 
Monument Butte
We are running four operated rigs in our Monument Butte Field in Utahs Uinta Basin. Including the adjacent Ute Indian Tribe acreage, the field now encompasses approximately 120,000 acres.
We have approximately 150 wells year-to-date and our gross sales in September averaged more than 13,000 BOPD. Most of our drilling since the fields acquisition in 2004 has been on 40-acre spacing. However, over the last 18 months, we have conducted multiple 20-acre spacing pilots and results have exceeded initial expectations. Our 2004 acquisition modeling predicted that the 20-acre wells would be inferior to 40-acre locations with average initial production of about 50 BOPD (compared to 75 BOPD for a 40 acre well).
We have now drilled nearly 50 wells on 20-acre spacing and our results indicate that 20-acre wells will have greater initial production rates and higher estimated recoveries. Initial production from our 20-acre wells is nearly TRIPLE our 04 projections with wells averaging as much as 160 BOPD. EUR estimates for 20-acre locations are up 50% to over 70,000 barrels per well.
 
The success of our 20-acre drilling program indicates the potential to drill well over additional 1,000 wells or more in the Monument Butte Field. The 20-acre locations are drilled from existing 40-acre pads. We have one rig dedicated exclusively to drilling 20-acre wells and plan to drill an additional 10 wells on 20-acre spacing by the end of 2007.
We completed our first well (with initial production of 180 BOPD) under our alliance with the Ute Indian Tribe, which covers 47,000 acres immediately north of our Monument Butte Field. We expect to drill about 12 wells under this alliance by year-end. Prospective targets are the same Green River oil sands found in Monument Butte.
Williston Basin
Our activity level has been on the rise in the Williston Basin. We currently have one operated rig running in the Bakken play and have a growing inventory of oil wells that we did not see at the time of the acquisition. Production is ahead of schedule and has increased to 3,000 BOEPD due in part to the success of our Bakken re-frac program.
Exploration on our 100,000-plus acres in the Williston Basin will be driven by 3-D seismic. We recently signed a joint venture with an industry partner that encompasses more than 13,000 acres. We will have a 40% interest. Under the JV, we have shot 56-square miles of new 3-D seismic data. We expect to drill 1-2 wells under this JV later this year. This will serve as a model for other programs that are being planned at this time.
Pinedale Field
In July, under a farm-out agreement with BP, we assumed operatorship of our interest in the Pinedale Field. In addition, we also increased our working interest to 85% from 50% for the first two years of our planned drilling program. We are currently drilling five wells from two separate pads on both 40-acre and 20-acre spacing locations. We recently began logging our first Pinedale well and will spud the second of three wells on the same pad in the next few days. Completion operations will begin in early 2008. We have approximately 8,000 net acres in this field.
 
Jonah Field
We recently drilled and completed our first Jonah well, which was operated by Encana. We expect to participate in seven additional wells during this drilling season.
Horseshoe Bend/Gusher
In the Horseshoe Bend Area (northeast of Monument Butte), we have drilled four successful shallow Green River wells year-to-date. We have an interest in approximately 32,000 acres in this area.
ONSHORE GULF COAST
We currently have seven operated rigs running along the Gulf Coast and are participating in five outside-operated wells. We also have formed new joint ventures increasing the size and scope of our operations onshore Texas.
South Texas Joint Venture
Sarita Field, South Texas:
 
Under our joint venture with Exxon-Mobil in South Texas, we have drilled 19 successful wells to date in the East Sarita Field area of Kenedy County. We are running two operated rigs there. The SKE B-90 well recently logged nearly 700 of net pay and is now being completed. Production associated with the joint venture is more than 50 MMcf/d (gross) with two wells completing.
New South Texas Joint Venture
We signed a joint venture with a private company that provides us with access to 58,000 acres just south and east of our Exxon-Mobil JV at Sarita in South Texas. Under this venture, we are mapping new 3-D seismic data from a 117-square mile area. We are merging an existing 226-square miles of 3-D data for a total of 343 square miles of data. We expect to drill our first wells here in early 2008.
East Texas Joint Venture
In the third quarter of 2007, we signed a JV with a private company active in East Texas. Together, we are exploring more than 10,000 net acres in East Texas. Prospective horizons include the Pettet and James formations. Initial drilling is expected in early 2008.
DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO
Newfield has an attractive portfolio of opportunities in deepwater, including producing fields, fields under development and significant exploration targets. We have three producing fields -- Wrigley, Rigel and Glider. Our 2008-09 production will benefit through first sales from the PowerPlay and Fastball developments.
Wrigley (MC 506) -
Production commenced during early July on our operated Wrigley Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The field is currently producing approximately 35 MMcfe/d and will ramp up to 60 MMcf/d later this year following the remedy of mechanical issues on the host platform. The issues are not related to the well or the reservoir.
We have a 50% working interest at Wrigley.
PowerPlay Development (GB 258) -
PowerPlay is being developed as a single well tieback to the Baldpate facility. Completion of the well is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2007 and first production is expected in late 2008. We have a 35% interest in PowerPlay.
Fastball
 
Development (VK 1003)
-
Development is proceeding at
Fastball, which tested earlier this year at 43 MMcf/d and 3,000 BCPD (gross). Fabrication of the umbilical is expected to be complete by year-end with installation scheduled for mid-2008. A new pipeline will be installed at the same time. We are developing the field through a sub-sea tieback to one of several existing fields in the area with first production expected in 2009. We operate Fastball with a 66% working interest.
INTERNATIONAL
 
China
In mid-August, we announced the signing of two new Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in the South China Sea. We now have three PSCs that cover more than 14,200 square kilometers (approximately 3.5 million acres). The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has the option to participate in any development with a 51% interest. W
e entered the area in late 2005 through the signing of a Production Sharing Contract on Block 17/08 and a Geophysical Survey Agreement (GSA) on Block 16/05. The GSA was recently converted to a Production Sharing Contract following encouraging results of a 2007 3-D seismic survey. We plan to drill two exploration wells in the first half of 2008, including one on each of the blocks.
 
We also have a Production Sharing Contract covering Block 22/15, a 5,228 square kilometer (nearly 1.3 million acres) area, located in the Beibuwan Basin, northwest of Hainan Island in southern China. The contract has an exploration term of seven years, with an exploration well commitment in the first three years.
 
Malaysia
Our oil production in Malaysia is expected to triple in 2008 when compared to 2007 volumes. The increase is being driven by several new field developments.
Our Abu Field commenced production late in the second quarter of 2007. The field is currently producing 13,000 BOPD and is ramping up to approximately 15,000 BOPD (gross). We hold a 50% interest.
Development continues at the Puteri Field on PM 318 with first oil sales expected in early 2008. Puteri oil will be lifted from existing facilities. The production deck set sail six weeks ago and is being installed and commissioned. Puteri is expected to add approximately 6,000 - 8,000 BOPD of gross oil production.
The East Belumut and Chermingat Fields on PM 323 are expected to be on-line in the second quarter of 2008 and will add 15,000 BOPD (gross).
FOURTH QUARTER 2007 ESTIMATES
Natural Gas Production and Pricing
The Companys natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be 38 - 42 Bcf (415 - 455 MMcf/d). Realized gas prices for the Companys Mid-Continent properties, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75 - 85% of the Henry Hub Index. Based on current prices, Newfield estimates that its realized price for natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, will average $0.40 - $0.60 less per MMBtu than the Henry Hub Index. Although Newfields Rocky Mountains production is primarily oil, the Company does produce approximately 40 MMcfe/d of natural gas in this region. Recent basis differentials have widened dramatically. Newfield hedged the basis differential associated with 50% of the expected production from the proved producing fields acquired from Stone Energy in the second quarter of 2007. The basis hedges cover the second half of 2007 through 2012 at a weighted average hedged differential of $(1.18) per Mcf. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
Crude Oil Production and Pricing
The Companys oil production, including international liftings, in the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million barrels (14,130 - 16,300 BOPD). Newfield expects to produce approximately 5,200 BOPD (net) from its Malaysian operations. The timing of liftings in Malaysia may affect total reported production. The price the Company receives for Gulf Coast production typically averages about $2 per barrel below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price. The price the Company receives for its production in the Rocky Mountains averages about $13 - $15 per barrel below WTI. Oil production from the Mid-Continent typically sells at a $1.00 - $1.50 per barrel discount to WTI. Oil production from Malaysia typically sells at Tapis, or about even with WTI. Hedging gains or losses will affect price realizations.
 
Lease Operating Expense and Production Taxes
LOE is expected to be $40 - $45 million ($0.82 - $0.93 per Mcfe) in the fourth quarter of 2007. With the recent divestiture of the Companys Gulf of Mexico Shelf assets, the major expense portion of LOE is expected to drop significantly. The LOE projection for the fourth quarter includes major expense of approximately $3 million. The drop in LOE per Mcfe will be partially offset by an increase in production taxes per Mcfe now that a significant portion of the Companys production is onshore and subject to severance taxes. Production taxes in the fourth quarter of 2007 are expected to be $32 - $36 million ($0.66 - $0.75 per Mcfe). Approximately one-third of the production taxes are associated with Newfields Malaysian operations.
General and Administrative Expense
G&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be $46 - $51 million ($0.96 - $1.06 per Mcfe), net of capitalized direct internal costs. Capitalized direct internal costs are expected to be $21 - $23 million. G&A expense includes incentive compensation expense, which depends largely on adjusted net income (as defined in the Companys incentive compensation plan), which excludes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. The gain associated with the sale of the U.K. business will increase adjusted net income and result in additional fourth quarter G&A expense of approximately $17 million.
Interest Expense
The non-capitalized portion of the Companys interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be $20 - $22 million ($0.41 - $0.45 per Mcfe). As of October 24, 2007, Newfield had no borrowings outstanding under its credit arrangements. The remainder of debt consists of three separate issuances of notes that in the aggregate total $1.05 billion in principal amount. Capitalized interest for the fourth quarter of 2007 is expected to be about $8 - $9 million.
Income Taxes
Including both current and deferred taxes, the Company expects its consolidated income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 to be about 35 - 38%. About 65% of the tax provision is expected to be deferred.
