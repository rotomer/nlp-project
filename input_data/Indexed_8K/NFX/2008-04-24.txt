First Quarter 2008
          Newfield's production in the first quarter of 2008 was 55.1 Bcfe. Production results exceeded guidance due to higher than expected production volumes from the Woodford Shale Play, increased oil liftings from Malaysia and better than expected production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Newfield's production in the first quarter of 2008 was 10% higher than production in the fourth quarter of 2007.
          "We have kicked off 2008 with strong production growth," said David Trice, Newfield Chairman, President and CEO. "Our first quarter production was above the upper end of our guidance range. We sold significant assets in 2007, making year-over-year comparisons difficult," Trice added. "However, when adjusting volumes for assets sold and acquired, our first quarter 2008 production was up more than 20% over pro forma production in the first quarter of 2007. We are raising our full-year 2008 guidance to account for better than expected production and a recent bolt-on acquisition in South Texas. Our new guidance is 224-234 Bcfe." Newfield's previous 2008 guidance was 215-230 Bcfe.
          For the first quarter of 2008, Newfield reported a net loss of $64 million, or $0.50 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The loss for the first quarter of 2008 includes a net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $281 million ($169 million after-tax), or $1.30 per share. In addition to the net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives, the Company also paid $15 million to reset a portion of its 2010 crude oil hedges. The after-tax effect of the reset was $9 million, or $0.07 per share.
          Without the effects of these items, net income was $114 million, or $0.87 per diluted share.
          Revenues in the first quarter of 2008 were $515 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $316 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
          Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2008 were $514 million, in line with the Company's first quarter budget.
Operational Update
     Newfield has entered the development phase in the Woodford. As a result, the Company is seeing significantly lower drilling and completion costs. Recent highlights include:
The Woodford 
 
     Based on the continued success of development drilling, higher oil prices and increased demand for black wax crude oil, Newfield recently added a fifth drilling rig in its Monument Butte field, located in the Uinta Basin of northeast Utah. The field is producing approximately 15,000 BOPD gross and is now expected to exit 2008 producing in excess of 16,000 BOPD gross. Increased demand for black wax crude allowed the Company to recently enter into additional term sales agreements with area refiners. Newfield expects to drill approximately 240 wells in the Monument Butte field during 2008.
Monument Butte Oil Field 
     Newfield continues to have success with its 20-acre infill drilling program at Monument Butte. To date, the Company has drilled 65 wells on 20-acre spacing, which indicates the potential to drill an additional 1,000-2,500 wells in the field. This is in addition to the more than 1,000 locations remaining to be drilled on 40-acre spacing. Newfield has drilled 680 wells in the field since acquiring it in 2004. The field has more than 1,000 producing oil wells.
 
     Newfield is currently drilling the first well under a Deep Gas Exploration Agreement signed earlier this year with Red Technology Alliance. The well is targeting the Mancos Shale and has a planned total depth of 16,600 feet. Prospective targets include the Wasatch, Mesa Verde, Blackhawk and Mancos Shale. The agreement allows for promoted exploratory drilling and progressive earning in approximately 71,000 net acres in which Newfield will retain a greater than 70% interest. Approximately 10,700 net acres in the immediate vicinity of recent deep gas tests drilled by Newfield in 2007 were excluded from the agreement. Newfield retains an 85% average interest in this area, where Newfield is currently participating (NFX 58% WI) in the completion and testing of two Mancos Shale wells. Newfield also expects to drill several operated wells in the excluded area in the second half of 2008.
     Newfield recently drilled two successful exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Gladden Prospect, located at Mississippi Canyon 800, found 80 feet of net oil pay. An updip location is being drilled that is expected to be completed in late May. The Anduin West Prospect, located at Mississippi Canyon 754, found 30 feet of net gas and condensate pay. The well is being completed and a production test is planned in the next week. Newfield is the operator of both discoveries and has a 47.5% working interest in Gladden and a 50% working interest in Anduin West. The Company has production handling agreements in place with nearby host facilities and expects first production from both fields in late 2009.
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Exploration Discoveries 
     In the March 2008 Federal OCS Lease Sale, Newfield was the high-bidder on 19 of 28 lease blocks (14 located in deepwater). If all blocks are awarded, the net investment will be approximately $70 million and builds prospect inventory for the next several years in deepwater.
Newfield recently signed an agreement to acquire a package of South Texas properties from a private company for $227 million. Current net production associated with the properties is approximately 19 MMcfe/d. Risked proved and probable reserves for the acquisition are 100 Bcfe, about half of which is classified as proved under SEC guidelines. Newfield has identified more than 100 drilling locations on the acquired acreage and sees the potential to add more than 200 Bcfe of total reserves from this acquisition. The assets overlap and expand Newfield's existing operations in the Wilcox and Vicksburg trends, two of Texas' most prolific producing regions. The acquisition adds 47,000 gross acres (32,000 net acres). Newfield plans to finance the transaction under its $1.25 billion undrawn revolving credit facility. Subject to customary conditions, the transaction is expected to close around May 1, 2008.
South Texas Acquisition 
     Newfield recently drilled its 26th successful well under its joint venture with Exxon-Mobil in South Texas. The most recent well  the B-94  was a deep discovery that significantly expanded the known limits of the Sarita Field. Last year, Newfield entered into a joint venture with a private company covering 42,000 acres southeast of Sarita and acquired 3-D seismic data. Within the next week, Newfield plans to spud the first of two additional high potential 2008 exploration wells in the Sarita area.
South Texas Joint Venture 
     Production under Newfield's JV with Exxon-Mobil set a record in the first quarter of 2008 of 85 MMcfe/d gross. Newfield's interest in this joint venture is approximately 50%. Newfield expects to drill an additional 10-12 wells in the area in 2008. The Company sees at least an additional 20 drilling locations and plans to operate 2-4 rigs throughout the year.
     Newfield made an oil discovery during the first quarter of 2008 on its Pearl River Mouth Basin acreage. The LF7-2-1 exploration well found nearly 60 feet of net oil pay. The well tested the first of a series of features on a structural ridge. Additional drilling is planned. Newfield operates the discovery with a 100% interest. Newfield's interest is subject to the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company's right to take a 51% interest during development. A separate exploratory well drilled during the quarter, the HZ28-1-1, was not commercial.
Offshore China Exploration Discovery 
     The Puteri production platform, located on PM 318, is undergoing final commissioning and the export pipeline has been installed. Newfield expects the field to commence first oil production in the second quarter and ramp up to 6,000-8,000 BOPD (gross). Newfield recently installed the production facility for the East Belumut and Chermingat fields, located on PM 323. A rig is on location and Newfield expects production from the fields to begin in the second quarter. The combined rate from these fields will ramp up to 15,000 BOPD (gross). The Abu Field, PM 318, has ramped up to a planned production rate of 15,000 BOPD (gross) and the field achieved payout in the first quarter of 2008  less than 10 months from the date of first production. Newfield has a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323.

1Q08 HIGHLIGHTS
PRODUCTION GUIDANCE
Our production in the first quarter of 2008 was 55.1 Bcfe. Production results exceeded the upper end of earlier guidance due to higher than expected production volumes from the Woodford, increased oil sales from Malaysia and better than expected production from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. All of our business units are growing in 2008. Production in the first quarter of 2008 was 10% higher than production in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 20% above the same period of last year (adjusted for asset sales and acquisitions).
 
We increased our 2008 production forecast to 224-234 Bcfe, up 18-23% over pro forma 2007 production. Previous 2008 guidance was 215-230 Bcfe. The increase reflects the strength of current production, a recently signed agreement for a bolt-on acquisition in South Texas (adds 4.5 Bcfe to estimated 08 production) and additional rigs in the Woodford and Monument Butte. The South Texas acquisition is expected to close around May 1 and current net production is 19 MMcfe/d.
MID-CONTINENT
The Mid-Continent region is our largest division with approximately 1.1 Tcfe of proved reserves at year-end 2007. Our most significant area of activity remains the Woodford Shale play, located in southeastern Oklahoma. We are the leader in the Woodford with 165,000 net acres. We also have approximately 50,000 acres in the Mountain Front Wash play, located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.
THE WOODFORD
The Woodford remains the most active play in Oklahoma with a record 46 industry rigs currently running. To date, we have spud 183 horizontal wells. Industry has spud more than 548 horizontal wells and at the current pace 100 new horizontal wells are being spud per quarter in the Woodford.
A record 46 active industry rigs in the Woodford 
Since year-end 2007, our production in the Woodford Shale has increased nearly 15%. Our gross operated daily production is 187 MMcfe/d. We expect that our gross operated production will exit 2008 at more than 250 MMcfe/d, an increase of more than 50% over year-end 2007 production.
Our Woodford production is growing 
We recently signed an agreement to increase our firm transportation on the MidContinent Express Pipeline (MEP) by 100,000 dekatherms per day (dth/d). We now have 300,000 dth/d of firm transportation on the MEP and we dedicated up to an additional 150,000 dth/d of natural gas production as it becomes available, which may increase our firm capacity to 450,000 dth/d on the MEP. Under a previously announced separate agreement, we also have firm transportation of 40,000 dth/d in 2008, increasing to 50,000 dth/d in 2009, with Laclede Energy Resources, Inc.
We signed additional firm transportation for our growing Woodford production 
 
Extended laterals are significantly lowering our cost to find and develop reserves. Drilling results and recently processed 3-D seismic data indicate that we can drill more than 80% of our 2008 wells as extended laterals  up from an estimate of 50% at the beginning of 2008.
>
80% of our planned wells in 2008 will be extended lateral completions 
We now have 20 extended lateral wells producing today  some of which have as much as 450 days of production. In addition, we have 6 extended laterals that commenced production in the last week and are cleaning up after fracture stimulation. There are 10 additional long laterals that have been drilled and will commence production in the next 30 days. The chart below illustrates performance from the 20 wells on-line today:
We are now producing from 20 extended lateral completions 
Currently, we are operating 11 rigs in the Woodford. Based on the success of recent drilling and cost reductions, a 12 drilling rig is being added for the remainder of 2008. We expect to drill nearly 120,000 feet of additional lateral in 2008 compared to 2007.
We are increasing our operated rig count 
th
Eight of our 11 operated rigs are drilling from multi-well pads. Pad drilling has helped to significantly decrease completed well costs through the elimination of roads, and by minimizing rig mobilization days between spuds. In addition, pads allow for the use of common fracture stimulation sites that further reduce completion costs. We expect that about 80% of our planned operated wells in 2008 will be drilled from multi-well pads, up from our beginning of the year estimate of 50%.
80% of our 2008 wells will be drilled from pads 
The most recent extended lateral wells have had initial gross production rates of more than 7 MMcfe/d and were drilled and completed for approximately $6.7 million (gross). Estimated ultimate gross recoveries are more than 4.5 Bcfe. Our recent wells have had lateral lengths of up to 4,700' and are completed with nine fracture stimulation stages.
We continue to reduce the cost of our extended lateral wells 
We also continue to reduce costs associated with our standard lateral completions (those with less than 3000' of horizontal section). Our standard wells averaged approximately $5.7 million (gross) in 2007. Our most recent standard lateral wells, drilled from common pads, have averaged less than $5 million (gross). About 20% of
Standard lateral drill and complete costs down 15% 
 
the wells we plan to drill in 2008 will be standard lateral completions.
We are conducting 16 spacing pilots in 2008 to determine optimal development well spacing. Ten of the pilots are being drilled on 40-acre spacing, four on 60-acre spacing and two on 80-acre spacing. To date, we have drilled and placed on production five development pilots that consist of 18 wells on varying development spacing, including 40, 60 and 80-acres. The production performance from these 18 wells is in line with our expectations.
Multiple spacing pilots ongoing throughout the acreage 
Typical Woodford Well Economic Assumptions
MOUNTAIN FRONT WASH
We continue to grow our production in the Mountain Front Wash Play, located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. Our production from the region set a new high of 110 MMcfe/d (gross) during the first quarter of 2008. Our interest is predominately 100% and we have approximately 50,000 net acres in the area.
Our production in the Mountain Front Wash set a record in Q1 
 
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
Monument Butte
Demand for black wax crude has increased and we entered into additional firm sales agreements with area refiners. We have added a fifth drilling rig in the field and expect to drill approximately 240 wells in 2008.
Increased black wax demand leads to addition of fifth drilling rig 
Current production at Monument Butte is approximately 15,000 BOPD gross. We have drilled 680 wells in the field and doubled production since acquiring it in late 2004. The field has more than 1,000 producing oil wells. Production is expected to exit the year at more than 16,000 BOPD.
Monument Butte production reaches record 15,000 BOPD
To date, we have drilled 65 wells on 20-acre spacing. Results indicate the potential to drill an additional 1,000-2,500 wells on 20-acre spacing. These well locations are in addition to the more than 1,000 locations remaining to drill the field down to 40-acre spacing.
Success continues with our 20-acre spacing program 
We are drilling the first of several deep Mancos Shale tests beneath Monument Butte under a Deep Gas Exploration Agreement signed earlier this year with Red Technology Alliance. The well is being drilled to a total depth of 16,600 feet. In addition to the Mancos Shale, other prospective targets include the Wasatch, Mesa Verde and Blackhawk formations. All of these are known gas producers in the region. The agreement allows for promoted exploratory drilling and progressive earning in approximately 71,000 net acres in which we will retain a greater than 70% interest. Approximately 10,700 net acres in the immediate vicinity of recent deep gas tests were excluded from the agreement. We plan to drill several operated Mancos Shale prospects in the excluded area in the second half of 2008 (NFX WI: 85%). Under a separate JV, we are currently participating in the completion and testing of two Mancos Shale wells in the area.
Mancos Shale 
Williston Basin
We have assembled 244,000 gross acres (160,000 net acres) in the Williston Basin. Our acreage position, which was built over the last three years, has prospective targets that include the Bakken, as well as the Madison and Red River formations. We expect to drill 10 operated wells in the area in 2008 and to participate in several outside operated wells. Our current net production from the area is about 2,550 BOEPD.
We now have nearly 250,000 gross acres in the Williston Basin 
We have several alliances and joint ventures throughout the region and are drilling our third Bakken well along the Nesson Anticline. This well is on our Lost Bear Prospect area. A separate structure is currently testing. We expect to have results from these wells in the second quarter.
Pinedale Field, Green River Basin
Through an agreement reached in 2007 with BP, we retained operatorship of our interests in the Pinedale field and increased our working interest to 85%. Year-to-date, we have completed four new wells with flow rates between 5 and 8 MMcfe/d. Our current production from Pinedale is approximately 25 MMcf/d net. We plan to drill 6-7 wells here in 2008.
 
GULF COAST
We recently drilled two successful exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Gladden prospect, located at Mississippi Canyon 800, found 80 feet of net oil pay. An updip location is being drilled that is expected to be completed in May. The Anduin West prospect, located at Mississippi Canyon 754, found 30 feet of net gas and condensate pay. The well is being completed and a production test is planned in the next week. We are the operator of both discoveries and have a 47.5% working interest in Gladden and a 50% working interest in Anduin West. We have production handling agreements in place with nearby host facilities and expect first production from both fields in late 2009.
Deepwater GOM Exploration Discoveries 
In the March 2008 Federal OCS Lease Sale, we were high-bidder on 19 of 28 lease blocks (14 located in deepwater). If all blocks are awarded, the net investment will be approximately $70 million. We now have an inventory of prospects that will allow us to drill 3-5 wells per year for the next several years. A map of our deepwater inventory and its proximity to infrastructure is shown below:
Success on 19 of 28 bids in recent OCS Lease Sale 
We recently agreed to acquire a package of South Texas properties from a private company for $227 million. Current net production associated with the properties is approximately 19 MMcfe/d. Risked proved and probable reserves for the acquisition are 100 Bcfe, about half of which is classified as proved under SEC guidelines. Newfield has identified more than 100 drilling locations on the acquired acreage and sees the potential to add more than 200 Bcfe of total reserves from this acquisition. The acquisition is expected to close within a week and will be financed under our $1.25 billion revolver. Some of the transaction's attributes are outlined below:
We agreed to acquire a package of South Texas assets for $227 MM 
 
Following the closing of this transaction, we will own interests in more than 400,000 gross acres and nearly 700 producing wells in Texas.
Sarita Field Area
We recently drilled our 26th successful well  the B-94  under our South Texas joint venture with Exxon-Mobil. The B-94 was a 7,000' step out that significantly expanded the productive area of the Sarita Field. Production under the joint venture set a new high in the first quarter of 85 MMcfe/d (gross). We have a 50% interest and expect to run 2-4 rigs throughout 2008.
B-94 well a significant extension to Sarita development 
Last year, we entered into a joint venture with a private company covering 42,000 acres southeast of Sarita and acquired 3-D seismic data. The success of the B-94 well high grades the potential of this new area. We plan to spud the first of two high potential 2008 exploration wells next week. We have identified prolific targets at depths of up to 20,000'. We have a 50% working interest in the venture.
Exploration well to spud next week on 42,000 acre JV with private co 
In the , we also had a discovery with the Salinas GU #1 that is currently producing 7 MMcf/d. We just finished drilling an offset, the Salinas GU #2, which confirms the same productive zone as the #1. The Salinas GU #3, another offset, will spud next. We have an 84% working interest in the Salinas wells.
South Texas Lobo Trend
In the , we recently extended the Poulter Field with the Poulter 2704 well, which flowed 6 MMcf/d from the Strawn formation. An offset to that well is planned for later this year.
Val Verde Basin
INTERNATIONAL
Offshore China
We made an oil discovery during the first quarter of 2008 with the LF7-2-1 exploration well, located in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. The well found nearly 60 feet of net oil pay and tested the first of a series of features on a structural ridge. Additional drilling is planned for late 2008 or early 2009. We operate the discovery with a 100% interest, subject to the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company's right to take a 51% interest during development. A separate exploratory well drilled during the quarter, the HZ28-1-1, was not commercial.
Offshore China Exploration Discovery 
Malaysia
The Puteri production platform, located on PM 318, is undergoing final commissioning and the export pipeline has been installed. We expect the field to commence first oil production in the second quarter and ramp up to 6,000-8,000 BOPD (gross). We recently installed the production facility for the East Belumut and Chermingat fields, located on PM 323. A rig is on location and we expect production from the fields to begin in the second quarter. The combined rate from these fields will ramp up to 15,000

BOPD (gross). The Abu Field, PM 318, has ramped up to a planned production rate of 15,000 BOPD (gross) and the field achieved payout in the first quarter of 2008  less than 10 months from the date of first production. Newfield has a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323.
The Puteri platform, located on PM 318 in Malaysia, is undergoing final commissioning.
2008 CAPITAL BUDGET
Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2008 were $514 million, in line with our first quarter budget. We increased our 2008 capital budget to $2 billion from an initial budget of $1.6 billion. The budget excludes approximately $115 million of capitalized interest and overhead. The increase reflects the following:
 
1Q08 ACTUAL RESULTS AND 2Q08 ESTIMATES
Note 1: Actual average realized prices include the effects of hedging contracts. If the effects of these contracts were excluded, the average realized price for total gas would have been $7.54 per Mcf and the total oil and condensate average realized price would have been $85.18 per barrel.
Note 2: Gas prices in the Mid-Continent, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, typically average 75-85% of the Henry Hub Index. Gas prices in the Gulf Coast, after basis differentials, transportation and handling charges, are expected to average $0.40-$0.60 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.

**The statements set forth in this publication regarding estimated or anticipated second quarter 2008 results, estimated full-year 2008 production, drilling and development plans, the timing of activities, the timing of initial production and future rates of production from wells, fields and regions, expected cost reductions in the Woodford Play and the expected ultimate recovery of reserves from wells are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of capital resources, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil we produces from our Monument Butte field in Utah and labor conditions. In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
