     The unaudited pro forma income statement presents our operations as if the Disposition had occurred as of the beginning of the period. No unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 is presented as the Disposition closed prior to December 31, 2007, and is excluded in the historical consolidated balance sheet in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
     Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules for pro forma financial statements, no pro forma adjustments were made with respect to the following:
