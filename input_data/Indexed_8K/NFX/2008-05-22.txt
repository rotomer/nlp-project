(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     announced today that it had reset its oil hedge positions for 2009 and 2010 on approximately 6.6 million barrels (MMBbls) of anticipated production. The new positions are:
Houston
 (May 21, 2008)  Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX)
 fixed price swaps on 3.3 MMBbls with a volume weighted average price of $128.93 per barrel; and
2009
 "put spreads" covering approximately 3.3 MMBbls by purchasing "at the money" puts at $127.29 per barrel and selling puts at $105.58 per barrel, which retains the upside benefit for prices in excess of $127.29 per barrel and provides protection of up to $22.39 per barrel for prices below $105.58 per barrel.
2010
     The cost to reset these hedges was approximately $520 million and was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our credit arrangements. The costs of the transactions will be recovered through higher realized prices in 2009-10.
     "With the exception of the net cost of the puts we purchased, resetting our hedge position is balance sheet neutral. Our future results of operations will more accurately reflect the cash flow from our growing oil production," said David Trice, Chairman, President and CEO. "These hedges originated with our 2004 acquisition of the Monument Butte field in the Uinta Basin of northeast Utah."

**  These 3way collar contracts are standard natural gas collar contracts with respect to the periods, volumes and prices stated above. The contracts have floor and ceiling prices per MMBtu as per the table above until the price drops below a weighted average price of $7.20 per MMBtu. Below $7.20 per MMBtu, these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are on average $1.50 per MMBtu higher than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized.
