Houston  July 23, 2008 
Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX)
Second Quarter 2008
          Newfield's production in the second quarter of 2008 was 57.6 Bcfe, exceeding the upper end of guidance for the quarter. Newfield has raised its 2008 expected range of production twice year-to-date and estimates that its full year volumes will be 232-239 Bcfe, an increase of 22-26% over 2007 pro forma production (adjusted for asset sales and acquisitions). Newfield's production in the second quarter of 2008 was approximately 20% higher than pro forma production in the second quarter of 2007.
          For the second quarter of 2008, Newfield reported a net loss of $244 million, or $1.89 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The loss for the second quarter of 2008 includes a net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $508 million ($384 million after-tax), or $2.95 per share.
          Without the effects of this item, net income was $140 million, or $1.06 per diluted share.
          Revenues in the second quarter of 2008 were $691 million. Net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $98 million. Net cash was negatively impacted by the $488 million cash payment to reset the Company's 2009-10 crude oil hedges. Excluding this cash payment, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in the second quarter of 2008 was $390 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
"Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"
          Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2008 were $730 million. This includes a previously announced $226 million South Texas acquisition.
Operational Update
          Newfield is continuing to lower its finding and development costs in the Woodford. Recent highlights include:
The Woodford 
 
          The field is producing approximately 15,600 BOPD (gross) and is expected to exit 2008 producing in excess of 16,500 BOPD (gross). Demand for black wax crude oil remains strong and Newfield expects to run five drilling rigs for the remainder of 2008. Newfield expects to drill approximately 240 wells in 2008 in the Monument Butte field.
Monument Butte Oil Field 
          One of the five operated rigs is dedicated to drilling 20-acre spaced development wells. To date, the Company has drilled 82 wells on 20-acre spacing. The success of this program indicates the potential to drill an additional 1,000-2,500 wells in the field, in addition to the more than 1,000 locations remaining to be drilled on 40-acre spacing. The field has nearly 1,100 producing oil wells and encompasses 100,000 gross acres.
          The estimated number of future development drilling locations excludes the Company's activities to the north of Monument Butte on lands controlled by the Ute Indian Tribe. The Company has drilled 30 successful wells on this acreage. Newfield recently added 15,000 acres to its agreement with Ute Energy LLC and now has 62,000 gross acres under this alliance.
          Newfield is assessing a deep gas play beneath Monument Butte. The first deep gas test under an agreement signed earlier this year with Red Technology Alliance has reached its proposed total depth and testing is underway. The well, drilled to more than 16,600 feet, targeted the Mancos Shale, as well as shallower, known productive horizons including the Wasatch, Mesa Verde and Blackhawk. The agreement allows for promoted exploratory drilling and progressive earnings in approximately 71,000 net acres in which Newfield will retain a greater than 70% interest. A second well under this agreement has begun drilling and results are expected in the third quarter of 2008.
          Approximately 10,700 net acres in the immediate vicinity of recent deep gas tests drilled by Newfield in 2007 were excluded from the agreement. Newfield retains an 85% average interest in this area, where Newfield is currently participating (NFX 58% working interest) in the testing of two Mancos Shale wells. Based on encouraging information from this play to date, Newfield has contracted an additional operated rig and is drilling a well with an 85% working
 
interest. This new well is excluded from the agreement described above. Newfield expects to drill several operated wells in this excluded area in the second half of 2008.
          Newfield has nearly 250,000 gross acres (160,000 net) in the Williston Basin. The Company's acreage position, which was built over the last three years, has prospective targets that include the Bakken, as well as the Madison, Red River and Three Forks/Sanish formations. The Company has three wells that are currently completing or testing and an additional well drilling. These wells all target the Bakken formation and complete results are expected in the third quarter. Newfield expects to drill 10 operated wells in the area in 2008 and to participate in several outside operated wells. The Company also plans to test the Three Forks/Sanish formation in a well planned for the third quarter. Current net production from the area is approximately 2,300 BOEPD.
Williston Basin 
          Newfield's production in Malaysia is currently 34,000 BOPD (gross), reflecting new oil production from the East Belumut, Chermingat (PM 323) and Puteri (PM 318) fields. Malaysian production is expected to further increase to 45,000 BOPD (gross) later this year as the fields increase to expected rates. Newfield has a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323.
Malaysia 
          Newfield is operating eight rigs in Texas, including five in South Texas, where the Company is drilling under two separate joint ventures with ExxonMobil covering nearly 140,000 gross acres. Newfield expects to remain active under these JVs for the next several years. Newfield's interest in these ventures is approximately 50%. Production from the Sarita field area is approximately 65 MMcfe/d (gross) and three additional wells are awaiting completion.
Texas 
          Newfield will host an analyst/investor meeting in New York City on September 9, 2008. The meeting will be held from 8:30 am through lunch at the St. Regis Hotel. A full agenda for the meeting will soon be available. A live webcast of the meeting will be accessible through the Company's website.

**This release contains forward-looking information. All information other than historical facts included in this release, such as information regarding estimated or anticipated third quarter 2008 results, estimated full-year 2008 production, drilling and development plans, the timing of activities, the timing of initial production and future rates of production from wells, fields and regions, expected cost reductions in the Woodford Shale and the expected ultimate recovery of reserves from wells, is forward-looking information. Although Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil Newfield produces from its Monument Butte field in Utah, the availability of capital resources, labor conditions and severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes). In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
          Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
          A reconciliation of earnings for the second quarter of 2008 stated without the effects of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
 
          Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
          A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (stated without the effect of certain items) to net cash used in operating activities is shown below:

2Q08 HIGHLIGHTS
First Quarter 2008 Drilling Activity
 
Second Quarter 2008 Drilling Activity
MID-CONTINENT
THE WOODFORD SHALE
The Woodford remains the most active play in Oklahoma with 641 industry wells drilled to date. We have operated 205 of these wells and have 165,000 net acres.
We remain the leader in the Woodford Shale 
We have contracted three additional rigs which will expand our operated fleet to 15 rigs in early 2009. We are contracting two new build rigs to be delivered in the second half of 2009, further expanding our count to 17 rigs. We plan to move to 24 operated rigs in the next two to three years. We have thousands of development locations on our acreage position.
We are increasing our rig count in the Woodford 
Since year-end 2007, our gross operated production in the Woodford has increased from 165 MMcfe/d to a second quarter high of more than 200 MMcfe/d. We have an additional 18 wells that have been drilled and await completion. Production from these wells is expected over the next few weeks. We expect that our gross operated production will reach 250 MMcfe/d before year-end, an increase of 50% over year-end 2007.
Our Woodford production is growing 
Substantially all of our planned wells in 2008 will be extended lateral completions. We have now drilled and placed on production 43 extended lateral wells, which are significantly lowering our finding and development costs. We have drilled and completed laterals as long as 4,600 feet with as many as 9 frac stages. We also have initiated drilling on our first dual lateral in the Woodford with results expected later this year.
Our completed well costs continue to decrease and our finding and development costs, on a net basis, are expected to be $2/Mcfe or below 
Eight of our 12 operated rigs are drilling from multi-well pads. Pad drilling has helped to significantly decrease completed well costs through the elimination of roads, and by minimizing rig mobilization days between spuds. In addition, pads allow for the use of common fracture stimulation sites that further reduce completion costs.
80% of our 2008 wells will be drilled from pads 
To date, we've drilled and placed on production 12 development pilots that consist of 39 wells.
Newfield believes that its acreage will ultimately be developed on 60-acre spacing or less 
We have agreements in place for 300,000 dth/d of firm transportation on the MidContinent Express Pipeline (MEP) and we have dedicated up to an additional 150,000 dth/d of natural gas production as it becomes available which may increase our firm capacity to 450,000 dth/d on MEP. We also have 40,000 dth/d of firm capacity in 2008, increasing to 50,000 dth/d in 2009, with Laclede Energy Resources, Inc. We may increase our firm transportation capacity in the future to accommodate our growth in the Woodford.
We have firm transport for our Woodford Development 
 
MOUNTAIN FRONT WASH
Our interest is predominately 100%, and we have approximately 50,000 net acres in the play, located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.
Production in the Mountain Front Wash reached a record 110 MMcfe/d (gross) in the second quarter -
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
MONUMENT BUTTE
Field production is expected to further increase to 16,500 BOPD by year end, representing a 20% increase in 2008. Demand for black wax is strong with 100% of 2008 planned volumes and approximately 90% of 2009's volumes sold under term contracts with area refiners.
Monument Butte production now 15,600 BOPD (gross)
To date, we have drilled 82 successful wells on 20-acre spacing. Results indicate the potential to drill as many as 2,500 wells on 20-acre spacing. These locations are in addition to the more than 1,000 locations remaining to drill the field down to 40-acre spacing. At year-end 2007, we had booked less than 5 MMBbls associated with 20-acre spacing.
Success continues with our 20-acre spacing program 
We have drilled the first of several deep Mancos Shale tests beneath Monument Butte under a Deep Gas Exploration Agreement with Red Technology Alliance. The well was drilled to nearly 17,000'. In addition to the Mancos Shale, other prospective targets include the Wasatch, Mesa Verde and Blackhawk formations. All of these are known gas producers in the region. The agreement allows for promoted exploratory drilling and progressive earning in approximately 71,000 net acres in which we will retain a greater than 70% interest. Approximately 10,700 net acres in the immediate vicinity of recent deep gas tests were excluded from the agreement. We are drilling our first of several operated Mancos Shale prospects in the excluded area. (NFX working interest: 85%). Under a separate JV in the eastern portion of the Monument Butte field, we are producing from one or two of the multiple producing gas zones in two recent Mancos Shale wells and additional completion work is underway.
Activity increasing in Deep Gas play beneath Monument Butte
-
Our newest rig in the Monument Butte field was dedicated as the "Joe B. Foster." Joe B. Foster founded Newfield in 1989.
 
WILLISTON BASIN
Our acreage position, which was built over the last three years, has prospective targets that include the Bakken, as well as the Madison, Red River and Three Forks/Sanish formations. We have three wells that are currently completing or testing and an additional well drilling. These wells all target the Bakken formation and complete results are expected in the third quarter. We expect to drill 10 operated wells in the area in 2008 and to participate in several outside operated wells. We also plan to test the Three Forks/Sanish formation in a well planned for the third quarter. Our current net production from the area is approximately 2,300 BOEPD.
We now have nearly 250,000 gross acres (160,000 net) in the Williston Basin 
We have several alliances and joint ventures throughout the region and are currently completing three horizontal Bakken wells.
GULF COAST
Newfield has an interest in nearly 500,000 acres in Texas and has production of more than 200 MMcfe/d. We are operating eight rigs in Texas, including five in South Texas. Newfield is active under two separate joint ventures with ExxonMobil in South Texas that cover nearly 140,000 (gross) acres. Newfield's interest in these ventures is approximately 50%. Production from the Sarita field area is approximately 65 MMcfe/d (gross) and three additional wells are being completed.
Our second JV, announced in the second quarter, allows us to jointly explore and develop approximately 87,000 gross acres in South Texas' prolific Vicksburg Trend. Our first wells are currently drilling. We anticipate an active drilling program in the area over the next several years.
GULF OF MEXICO
Our production from the Gulf in 2008 is expected to be about 17 Bcfe, representing a more than 20% increase over 2007 (after asset sales). The increase relates primarily to our Wrigley field development. Wrigley is producing approximately 50 MMcfe/d (gross) through a host facility operated by a major oil company. We operate Wrigley with a 50% working interest.
We have four deepwater developments underway:
PowerPlay commenced production in late June. It is a single well tieback to the existing Baldpate deepwater platform and is currently on-line producing approximately 5,900 BOPD (gross) and 16 MMcf/d. We have a 35% interest in PowerPlay.
Gladden: The MC 800#1updip sidetrack was successful and completed. The well tested 4,600 BOPD and 5.9 MMcf/d. We expect first production in late 2009 or early 2010 from the nearby Gomez infrastructure. We operate and have a 47.5% working interest.
Anduin West: The Anduin West Prospect, located at Mississippi Canyon 754, found 30 feet of net gas and condensate pay in the first quarter. The well tested 18 MMcf/d and 2,400 BCPD. It is also located near the Gomez facility, which will process our production. We expect first production in late 2009.
Fastball will be a sub-sea tieback to one of several existing fields in the area with first production expected in late 2009 or early 2010. We operate Fastball with a 66% working interest.
We have been awarded all of the leases on which we were high bidder at the March OCS lease sale, including 14 of 23 blocks in the deepwater and five blocks in shallow water. Over the last several years, we have assembled an attractive portfolio of deepwater prospects. With this inventory, we expect to drill 3-4 wells per year for the next several years.
 
INTERNATIONAL
MALAYSIA
Our current production in Malaysia is 34,000 BOPD (gross) and reflects new production from the East Belumut, Chermingat (PM 323) and Puteri (PM 318) fields. Production is expected to further increase to 45,000 BOPD (gross) later this year as the fields ramp up to expected rates. We have a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323.
We announced the signing of a new production sharing contract in shallow water Malaysia during the second quarter on license area SK 310. The area covers nearly 1.2 million acres and is located in about 300' of water offshore Sarawak. Our partnership has committed to shoot 500 square kilometers of new 3-D seismic data and to drill three exploration wells. Seismic acquisition is expected to commence later this year and drilling could begin in late 2009 or early 2010. We will operate SK 310 with a 30% interest. Other partners include Mitsubishi Corporation (30% interest) and Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. (40% interest), the exploration and production subsidiary of Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional Berhad.
We entered Malaysia in 2004 and now have PSCs covering three shallow water blocks and one deepwater block. The PSCs total a combined 2.9 million acres.
The E. Belumut "A" platform which recently commenced production.
CHINA
Development drilling continues in Bohai Bay. Current production is 18,000 BOPD gross. Newfield holds a 12% interest in the unit. The partners plan to drill at least five additional development wells in 2008.
