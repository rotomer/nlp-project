Third Quarter 2008
Newfields production in the third quarter of 2008 was 61.4 Bcfe. Production during the third quarter reflects the impact of the deferral of more than 2 Bcfe of production as a result of recent storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on the pace of storm recovery, Newfield was today able to slightly increase its full-year 2008 expected range of production to 235-238 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 25% over 2007 pro forma production (adjusted for asset sales and acquisitions). Previous guidance was 234-238 Bcfe.
For the third quarter of 2008, Newfield reported net income of $724 million, or $5.48 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Income for the third quarter of 2008 includes a net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $846 million ($589 million after-tax), or $4.46 per share.
 Without the effect of this item, net income was $135 million, or $1.02 per share.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2008 were $680 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $396 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Capital Investments, Financial Update
said David Trice, Chairman, President and CEO.
Both operationally and financially, Newfield is performing very well in 2008,
Unfortunately, the realities of todays broader markets have shifted investor focus away from most traditional valuation metrics. Over the last 20 years, we have weathered many cycles and each time have relied on our strong balance sheet, hedging, ample access to liquidity and the proven track record of our management team. We are focused on what matters in 2009. We will fund the best projects. Our reduction in 2009 planned capital expenditures, $450 million less than our initial planned capital expenditures, will help ensure that we balance current growth expectations with our consistent goal of building long-term value for our shareholders. We have a diverse portfolio of assets which provide us with multiple options in todays environment.
Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2008 were $514 million. Newfield reiterated that it expects 2008 capital investments to total approximately $2.2 billion, which includes a $226 million acquisition in the first half of the year.
Newfield today disclosed a significant reduction in its planned spending levels in 2009. For 2009, Newfield plans to invest $1.65 billion --- matching its capital budget with cash flow expectations. The 2009 budget includes approximately $100 million for capitalized interest and overhead. This reduced budget compares to preliminary guidance of approximately $2.1 billion (including capitalized interest and overhead), announced on September 9, 2008. Newfield expects 8-13% production growth in 2009, or a range of 255-267 Bcfe. A detailed budget overview will be presented during Newfields conference call with analysts and investors at 3:30 p.m. CDT, October 22, 2008.
For 2009, Newfield has hedged nearly 60% of its expected natural gas production and about 90% of expected domestic oil production. These hedge positions, which help ensure cash flow in 2009, are detailed in the Companys @NFX publication on the Companys website.
Newfield has a $1.25 billion credit revolver funded through 18 financial institutions. The largest commitment by a member of the syndicate of financial institutions is 8% of the facility. At the end of the third quarter, Newfield had $285 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility.
For an operational update on Newfields focus areas, please see the @NFX publication on the Companys website.
The Company provides information regarding its outstanding hedging positions in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and in its electronic publication -- @NFX.  This publication can be found on Newfields web page at . Through the web page, you may elect to receive @NFX through e-mail distribution.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2008 stated without the effects of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
The determination of Net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives for the third quarter of 2008 is as follows:
(1)
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
 
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

MID-CONTINENT
THE WOODFORD SHALE
Our gross operated production from the Woodford Shale reached more than 220 MMcfe/d in September, up from 165 MMcfe/d at year end 2007. Gross production is expected to exit 2008 at approximately 250 MMcfe/d and production volumes in 2009 are expected to increase nearly 40% over 2008 levels.
The Woodford remains the most active play in Oklahoma and its development represents our largest capital expenditure. There are 736 industry horizontal wells drilled to date. We have operated more than 225 of these wells and have 165,000 net acres, of which approximately 80% is held-by-production.
The Woodford will remain our largest area of capital investment in 2009. We plan to run 12 operated rigs through the end of 2008 with this number increasing to 15 operated rigs in 2009.  We have the option to add, or reduce, our rig count as service costs and/or commodity prices warrant.
 
We are currently completing our first dual lateral well (each lateral is 4,800 in length) in the Woodford. The well was successfully drilled and completions are going as planned with first production in early November. Success with this concept could significantly lower development costs for the play. In November, we will spud our first super extended lateral of 8,000 to 10,000.
More than half of our operated rigs today are drilling from common pads. To date, we have completed and placed on production 59 wells drilled from pads. Cost improvements from the first well on a pad to the fourth well have ranged from 25% to as much as 75%. Pad drilling significantly decreases completed well costs through the elimination of roads, and by minimizing rig mobilization days between spuds, optimizing completion logistics as well as through reduced drilling days. In addition, pads allow for the use of common fracture stimulation sites that further reduce completion costs.
Woodford Firm Transportation Helps Maximize Future Price
In an effort to ensure that we minimize basis differentials, we have signed firm transportation for a substantial portion of our expected growth in the Woodford Shale. We have firm transportation on Midcontinent Express Pipeline (MEP) and sales to Laclede Energy Resources for a total of 360,000 dth/d of firm capacity in 2009.  This will increase with Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC beginning in March 2010 initially adding 100,000 dth/d.  Firm transportation will incrementally expand to a maximum total of 600,000 dth/d in 2012.
MOUNTAIN FRONT WASH/STILES RANCH FIELD
Our working interest is predominately 100%, and we have approximately 50,000 net acres in the play, located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. Drilling activity in Mountain Front Wash continues with 3 operated rigs running. Stiles Ranch hit a mid-year 2008 high of more than 110 MMcfe/d.
Horizontal drilling technology has dramatically changed the landscape of onshore drilling through more efficient reserve recovery and lower finding and development costs.  The Stiles Ranch field, one of Newfields largest producing assets, has been developed to date with vertical wells. Our knowledge base from the Woodford Shale is now being applied to the future development of Stiles.
We recently performed a study on the feasibility of horizontal drilling in the Stiles Ranch field. Horizontal development has the potential to improve estimated recovery and lower F&D costs.  We plan to test lateral lengths between 2,500 and 4,000. We are drilling our first horizontal well with a planned lateral length of 3,800. We have an extensive inventory of drilling locations in Stiles Ranch  including up to 110 horizontal locations. We plan to dedicate at least 1 of 3 rigs next year to drilling horizontal wells.
 
 
 
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
MONUMENT BUTTE
Our largest producing oil asset in the Rocky Mountains is Monument Butte, located in the Uinta Basin of Utah. Current gross production is approximately 15,700 BOPD and is expected to increase to about 16,500 BOPD in November. In 2009, we will continue with a 5-rig operated program. Demand for black wax remains strong with 100% of 2008 and 2009 volumes sold under term contracts with area refiners.
 
Success continues with our 20-acre spaced development program. To date, we have drilled 115 successful wells on 20-acre spacing. Results continue to indicate the potential to drill as many as 2,500 wells on 20-acre spacing. These locations are in addition to the more than 1,000 locations remaining to drill the field down to 40-acre spacing. Our total acreage in the Monument Butte field area includes about 162,000 gross acres, which includes 62,000 acres with Ute Energy and the Ute Tribe.
 
Newfield is drilling its 40
th
well on Tribal acreage today  38 of the 39 wells drilled to date have been successful. Recent wells on the Ute acreage have performed above expectations and are consistent with main field producing intervals to the south. One rig will be dedicated to drilling wells on this acreage throughout 2009
.   
 
We are assessing the deep gas potential beneath Monument Butte. Prospective targets include the Wasatch, Mesa Verde, Blackhawk, Mancos and Dakota. The play concept covers 82,000 acres and is held by production through our shallow Green River oil production at Monument Butte.
 
We have drilled the first two of several deep Mancos Shale tests beneath Monument Butte under a Deep Gas Exploration Agreement that is underway with Red Technology Alliance (RTA). The initial well is being completed and the second well is drilling to 18,500.
 
Approximately 10,700 net acres in the immediate vicinity of recent deep gas tests were excluded from the agreement. Completion of our first operated deep gas test (NFX working interest 75%) is underway and a second well (NFX working interest 100%) is drilling.
 
GREATER WILLISTON BASIN 
 
Our current net production from the area is approximately 2,500 BOEPD, and our activity level in the greater Williston Basin is expected to increase in 2009. We plan to operate three rigs throughout 2009. Plans include continued development and expansion along the Nesson Anticline and our exploration areas west of the Nesson and in Montana. 
 
We have 473,000 gross acres (160,000 net) in the Williston Basin.Our acreage position has prospective targets that include the Bakken Shale, as well as the Madison, Red River and Three Forks/Sanish. We completed additional horizontal wells in the Bakken formation and early production results are summarized below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Jorgenson 1-15H, our first Sanish/Three Forks horizontal well, is an apparent success and the well awaits completion at this time. Flow rates are expected in early November. We expect to drill four additional operated wells near this well in 2008.
Continued development drilling in our Westberg prospect area is planned, where we have drilled three successful wells to date and identified 22 development locations from earlier successes and additional infill drilling locations. We also plan continued development drilling in our Lost Bear prospect area where we have drilled three successful wells to date and identified 5-10 development locations.
 
In 2009, we will assess our acreage position west of the Nesson and in Montana.  Two wells are planned in our Big Valley area and four wells are planned in our large acreage positions in the Southern Alberta Basin and northeastern Williston Basin.
 
 
GULF COAST REGION
 
Newfield and partners recently announced a significant deepwater Gulf of Mexico discovery at the Dalmatian prospect, located at Desoto Canyon Block 48. The well found more than 120' measured depth of net high quality dry gas pay. The discovery is located in about 5,900 of water.
The discovery will be developed via a subsea tie to existing infrastructure. Newfield has a 37.5% working interest. Partners include: Murphy Oil Corporation (operator) with a 50% working interest, and Mariner Energy with a 12.5% working interest.
In addition to Dalmation, we own working interests between 23% and 50% in nine contiguous blocks offsetting this discovery. We have five additional amplitude prospects in the area that we are evaluating for future exploration and development potential.
In addition to Dalmation, we have four additional deepwater developments:
Gladden: The MC 800#1updip sidetrack tested approximately 5,600 BOEPD.  We expect first production in late 2009 or early 2010. We operate and have a 47.5% working interest.
 
Anduin West: Located at Mississippi Canyon 754, the well tested 18 MMcf/d and 2,400 BCPD. We expect first production in late 2009.
Fastball: Located at VK 1003, this single well development will be a sub-sea tieback to existing infrastructure with first production expected in late 2009 or early 2010. We operate Fastball with a 66% working interest.
Glider: Operator Shell plans to spud the Glider #5 development well in Green Canyon Block 248 during the second quarter of 2009. This well will be drilled in proximity to the original Glider discovery well drilled in 1996. Plans call for production in late 2009. We have a 25% working interest in Glider.
 
SOUTH TEXAS
 
Newfield has an interest in nearly 500,000 acres in Texas.
 
Newfield is active under two separate joint ventures with ExxonMobil in South Texas that cover nearly 140,000 (gross) acres. Newfields interest in these ventures is approximately 50%. Production from the Sarita field area is approximately 67 MMcfe/d (gross). At Sarita, we have established pay in a new fault block with our SKE B-96 well, which logged nearly 200' of net pay.
We made a potential discovery with J. G. Kenedy #1 in Kenedy County, Texas. The well was drilled to 18,142' with casing and completion operations already begun. We are currently drilling below 17,000' on the Kenedy #2, which is being drilled on a separate structure on this 35,000 acre block, which lies just east of our prolific Sarita Field. We have a 50% working interest. The potential gross size of this prospect is 80 - 100 BCFE.
INTERNATIONAL
MALAYSIA
 
Current gross production in Malaysia is more than 35,000 BOPD. Although exploration expenditure will be curtailed in 2009, development of our oil fields will continue. In shallow water Malaysia, we have a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323. We expect to spud the Paus-1 exploration well in the first quarter of 2009 in Deepwater Block 2C. We are the operator with a 40% working interest. Other partners include Petronas Carigali (40%) and Mitsubishi (20%).
 
CHINA
Current production from two fields on Blocks 04/36 and 05/36 is 18,000 BOPD gross or approximately 2,000 BOPD net to NFX. Newfield holds a 12% interest in the unit. The operator, Anadarko, is planning to drill 25-30 additional development wells in the complex and production is expected to further increase in 2009.
