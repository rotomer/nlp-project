said President Lee K. Boothby.
Our first quarter operating results were solid and were off to a great start in 2009, despite the macro-challenges in our industry today,
Our cost and expenses in the first quarter were within or below our guidance levels, reflecting a continuing reduction in service costs and the diligent efforts of our teams to lower costs and maximize returns throughout the Company. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2009 production goals (up 6-10% over 2008) while living within cash flow. More importantly, we have the people and prospects in place today to grow production, while again living within cash flow, in 2010-2011.
First Quarter 2009
For the first quarter of 2009, Newfield recorded a net loss of $694 million, or $5.35 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The loss reflects the following items:
Without the effect of the above items, net income for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $112 million, or $0.85 per share.
Revenues in the first quarter of 2009 were $262 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $347 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Newfields production in the first quarter of 2009 was 63 Bcfe. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2009 were $369 million.

**This release contains forward-looking information. All information other than historical facts included in this release, such as information regarding estimated or anticipated second quarter 2009 results, estimated 2009 capital expenditures, cash flow, production and cost reductions, drilling and development plans and the timing of activities, is forward-looking information. Although Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil Newfield produces from its Monument Butte field in Utah, the availability and cost of capital resources, labor conditions and severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes). In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings Stated Without the Effects of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effects of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effects of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effects of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the first quarter of 2009 stated without the effects of certain items to net loss is shown below:
 
The determination of Net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives for the first quarter of 2009 is as follows:
(1)
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

KEY MESSAGES
 
 
 
 
 
 
MID-CONTINENT
 
 
Our fastest growing division over the last three years has been the Mid-Continent. Our gross operated production in the Mid-Continent recently set a new record of more than 400 MMcfe/d (nearly 300 MMcfe/d net). This includes a recent high in our Granite Wash play of 145 MMcfe/d gross.
 
 
 
 
Woodford Shale
 
We continue to optimize our drilling program in the Woodford. Its development has represented the largest portion of our annual capital expenditures for the last three years. We have 165,000 net acres, of which over 90% is held-by-production, providing us with control over timing of expenditures and the pace of drilling. Our average lateral length in 2009 is expected to be 5,000 or greater, improving the efficiency of our operations. Approximately 80% of our wells in 2009 will be drilled from common pad locations.
We recently released an operated rig in the Woodford and are now running 11 rigs. Six of these remaining rigs come off of term contract during 2009. Our gross operated Woodford production is approximately 240 MMcfe/d. Due to the recent weakness in natural gas prices and a continuing decline in service costs, we are intentionally deferring new well completions. However, production from the Woodford is still expected to grow approximately 20% in 2009. Our working interest across the Woodford now averages 61% as compared to 58% at year-end 2008.
Gas sales will begin in June on the new Mid-Continent Express Pipeline (MEP), linking our Woodford production to Perryville, La. We have 300 MMcf/d of firm transportation on MEP that will reduce differentials to about half of the level we realized in the first quarter.
Granite Wash Play
 
Production from the Stiles Ranch field, located in the Texas Panhandle, recently set a record gross production rate of 145 MMcfe/d. We recently added a rig and are now running three operated rigs in the field, all of which are drilling horizontal wells. We have an approximate 80% interest in the field.
 
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
 
Monument Butte Field
Monument Butte oil sales are averaging 19,000 BOPD, up from 17,000 BOPD at year-end 2008. We continue to run three operated rigs (down from five in 2008). This three-rig program is expected to provide for modest production growth in 2009.
2
Differentials for our Black Wax crude oil have narrowed recently to approximately $12 per barrel compared to $16-$18 per barrel at year-end 2008.
 
Williston Basin 
 
We have a significant acreage position in the Williston Basin. We have nearly 500,000 net acres and are focused primarily on the Bakken Shale and Three Forks/Sanish formations. Based on our success to date, we have a growing inventory of locations in the region. We are operating a one-rig program in the Williston today.
 
3
We have drilled 10 wells (8 in the Bakken and 2 in the Sanish/Three Forks).  The most recent wells are listed below:
 
 
 
 
Our recent drilling hasfocused in North Dakota on the Nesson Anticline and west of the Nesson. Complete drilling results are below:
 
 
 
We are producing approximately 2,700 BOEPD net. Differentials in the Williston Basin today are less than $6 per barrel, significantly improved from year-end 08.
 
INTERNATIONAL
Malaysia
 
We are producing more than 40,000 BOPD from seven shallow water oil fields on blocks, PM 318 and PM 323. Although planned activity levels were reduced in 2009 due to capital budget constraints, oil production is forecast to increase 10% over 2008 levels.
 
The PM 323 fields (East Belumut and Chermingat) are currently producing 13,000 BOPD gross. We have a 60% operated interest in PM 323.  
 
We are proceeding with development of an additional fault block in the Penara Field in PM 318 with an NFX 50% working interest (2009 first production), the West Belumut satellite platform in PM 323 (2010 first production) and the field development plan for East Piatu Field in PM 329 (2011 first production  NFX 70% working interest).
 
4
We drilled the Paus-1 exploration well in February 2009 in deepwater Block 2C.  The well made an encouraging natural gas find with several high quality reservoir sands in the objective interval.  We are the operator with a 40% working interest. Other partners include Petronas Carigali (40%) and Mitsubishi (20%).
 
China
Current gross production from our fields in Bohai Bay is 19,000 BOPD, or approximately 2,000 BOPD net to our interest.  We are making plans to drill an appraisal well to our 2008 discovery in Block 16/05 in the Pearl River Mouth Basin if an appropriate rig is secured. The LF 7-1-1 well will test an independent four-way closure downthrown to the LF 7-2 oil discovery. We have a 100% working interest in this well; CNOOC has a 51% back-in election to any commercial development.
