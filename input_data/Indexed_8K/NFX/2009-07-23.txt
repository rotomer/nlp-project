Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
said President & CEO Lee K. Boothby.
Our second quarter results show the diligent efforts of our employees to lower costs and improve margins throughout our focus areas,
We are seeing cost reductions throughout our operations. A combination of improving efficiencies in drilling and completions, falling service costs and a strong hedge position in 2009-2010 provides us with an advantage in todays challenging environment. Our production volumes are strong. In fact, we expect to be in the top half of our guidance range for 2009
AND
we intend to continue deferring completions in the Woodford, as well as defer completions on the remainder of our planned Granite Wash wells in 2009.
We are intensely focused on how we are allocating capital in our business units today, ensuring that dollars are flowing to the areas with the best returns and the highest growth prospects. We intend to meet our production targets in 2009 and are confident that our portfolio will allow us to grow production at similar percentage levels, within cash flow, in 2010-11.
Second Quarter 2009
For the second quarter of 2009, Newfield recorded a net loss of $39 million, or $0.30 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). The loss reflects a net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $322 million ($208 million after-tax), or $1.58 per share.
Without the effect of this item, net income for the second quarter of 2009 would have been $169 million, or $1.28 per share.
Revenues in the second quarter of 2009 were $287 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $417 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Newfields production in the second quarter of 2009 was 65 Bcfe, an increase of 12% over the second quarter of 2008. An additional 1 Bcfe was produced in Malaysia during the second quarter of 2009 but was not lifted due to timing of liftings. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2009 were $300 million.

First seven wells have initial production average of 22 MMcfe/d
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
today provided an update on its recent successes in the Granite Wash play, located in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. Since late 2008, Newfield has operated the drilling and completion of seven horizontal Granite Wash wells. The seven wells had average initial production rates of 22 MMcfe/d.

The commenced production this week at 21 MMcf/d and 570 BCPD from a 3,600 lateral completion. Newfield has a 100% interest in the well.
Williams 33-7H
Production capacity from Newfields Elk City region is about 150 MMcfe/d (gross). The largest contributor is the Stiles Ranch field, located in Wheeler County, Texas, which is currently producing 112 MMcfe/d gross.
 
 
 
Three operated drilling rigs are running in the field today. Earlier this year, Newfield moved a drilling rig from South Texas to the Granite Wash. The rigs are under term contract today and a minimum of a three-rig program is planned for the remainder of 2009. Newfield expects to drill 14 wells in 2009. Newfields drill and complete costs in the Granite Wash to date have averaged about $10 million gross. The Companys most recent well, the Williams 33-7H, was drilled and completed for $7.4 million. Longer lateral completions, lower rig rates and ongoing efficiency gains are expected to further improve returns in the play. Longer lateral completions (3,800-4,600) are planned for the second half of 2009. With a deep inventory of drilling locations, Newfield expects to run a 3-5 operated rig program in the Granite Wash play for the next several years.
Background:
Newfield acquired its initial interest in the Stiles Ranch Field in 2002 through the EEX Corp acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, the field was producing less than 3 MMcfe/d. Following a detailed field study and the acquisition of other owners interest, Newfield kicked off a vertical drilling program. Nearly 150 vertical wells were drilled from 2003-08. Newfields experience in horizontal drilling in the Woodford Shale play led to the commencement of a horizontal drilling program in late 2008.
An extensive vertical drilling program has yielded gas production from more than 30 horizons in the Stiles Ranch Field, ranging from 12,000 to 15,000. The Company believes that there are multiple prospective zones for horizontal development. Newfield has approximately 20,000 net acres in the Stiles Ranch Field and an additional 15,000 net acres in western Oklahoma. Approximately 80% of the acreage is currently held-by-production.

KEY MESSAGES
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MID-CONTINENT
 
 
The Mid-Continent remains our fastest growing division with our drilling activities today focused in the Woodford Shale and the Granite Wash plays. Gross operated production in the Mid-Continent is 400 MMcfe/d, or 292 MMcfe/d net. In addition, the Company has about 25 wells that have been drilled but not completed in the Woodford Shale play.
 
 
Woodford Shale
 
We are in development mode today in the Woodford Shale. Our efficiencies are stemming from pad drilling, continued lengthening of lateral laterals, lower service costs and optimization of drilling and completion techniques. We are running 10 operated rigs, all under term contract. Our operated rig count is down from 13 at the beginning of the year as three term rigs were dropped as their contracts expired. Of the 10 rigs running, four roll off of term in the balance on 2009. We expect to drill about 75 wells in 2009, lower than our beginning of the year estimate of 85 wells.
Development of the Woodford Shale continues to represent the largest portion of our annual capital expenditures. Despite the lower rig count, we expect that our current plans would grow net operated production approximately 18% over 2008. Our investments will also result in significant reserve growth in 2009, as well.
 
 
  We continue to push lateral lengths longer in the Woodford Shale. Due to the favorable regulatory environment in Oklahoma, we are able to drill super extended laterals  or laterals up to 10,000. Longer laterals lower our ultimate finding costs and minimize our surface disturbance by limiting the number of wells required to fully develop the field.
Increasing lateral lengths lead to improving returns.
 
2
 
Two wells are currently drilling in the Woodford that have planned lateral lengths of 10,000. We are working with regulatory agencies in Oklahoma to drill on stand-up 640s, a section that is  mile wide and 2 miles long. Our primary limiting factor in lateral length is the geologic faulting, not lease or unit boundaries.
Our average lateral length in 2009 is expected to be around 5,000. In the Woodford, the majority of our historical drilling challenges have come from the vertical portion of the well -- primarily due to the fact that we drill through several known productive zones above the Woodford formation (Wapanucka, Cromwell, Caney). By optimizing the cost of the vertical against longer laterals, we are improving our finding and development costs.
The following chart shows our average Woodford gross perforated intervals by year, compared to the same data in the Barnett and Fayetteville Shale plays.
Shown another way, we have increased our average lateral length drilled per well by approximately 85% since 2006. Over the same time period, we have decreased our completion costs per lateral foot by approximately 60%... again, the benefit of development mode.
 
  One of the largest contributors to our cost reductions in the Woodford is pad drilling, a common development technique in resource plays. Now that more than 90% of our acreage is held-by-production, our development drilling consists of multi-well pads. Approximately 85% of our wells in 2009 will be drilled from common pad locations. The chart below depicts the economic benefit of pad drilling. We have seen nearly a 50% reduction in costs-per-completed lateral foot from the first well on a section to the eighth. Our drilling engineers are gaining incremental knowledge with each well on a section.
Pad drilling.

  Our current gross operated Woodford production is approximately 240 MMcfe/d, or about flat with our first quarter exit rate. We have deliberately slowed our pace of well completions and today have an inventory of about 25 wells awaiting completion. Our completion timing depends largely on natural gas prices and service costs.
Production.
  Gas sales began last week on the new Mid-Continent Express Pipeline (MEP), linking our Woodford production to Perryville, La. For 2009, we have 300 MMcf/d of firm transportation on MEP and an additional 50 MMcf/d on LaClede. In addition, we have staged additional firm transportation on Boardwalk to coincide with our future growth needs. In total, we have approximately 650 MMcf/d of firm transportation. We expect that this will help reduce price differentials and give us the best possible pricing for our Woodford gas.
Firm Transportation.

The Granite Wash
 
 
 
Granite Wash is a mature play, with gas-charged sand deposits covering a 20 by 100-mile area in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma.  We have been active in the play since 2002, following our acquisition of EEX Corp. Our largest producing asset in the trend today is Stiles Ranch, located in Wheeler County, Texas. Our production from Stiles has increased significantly under our ownership, reflecting nearly 150 vertical wells and our recent focus on horizontal drilling. Stiles is the largest contributor in our Granite Wash play, which reached a second quarter peak production rate of 147 MMcfe/d gross. Shown in the graph below is our Stiles Ranch production  now at 112 MMcfe/d gross.
 
 
The Granite Wash is a resource play, defined by tight, unconventional gas targets and an expansive geographic region. The play is mature, with most of the acreage held by production from multiple zones. Our Granite Wash play is focused on geologic targets between 12,000 and 15,000.
 
In geologic time, there was a northwest-southeast trending mountain chain higher than the Himalayas.  A deep inland sea existed in front of these mountains and they eroded over time. The sediment was quickly moved down the ocean shelf and into the deep basin forming wide spread sand deposits called fans or lobes.   This process occurred many times to form the wash deposits that range in thickness from 3,200 to 3,500.  The cartoon below depicts the mountain region, climate, weathering and the resulting deposit of sands in the ancient inland sea.  Eventually, these sand lobes became sandstone that filled with oil and gas (hydrocarbon reservoirs).
 
 
5
 
We use well control and 3D seismic to identify our horizontal targets.  In addition, we have more than 2,000 Granite Wash wells from the basin that have been tied through log and production data.
 
 
The primary targets in our Stiles Ranch field include the Marmaton, Cherokee, Red Fork and Atoka formations. We are also able to identify zones most prospective for oil.
 
 
Horizontal drilling was only recently implemented in the Granite Wash, primarily due to its deeper drilling depths. Newfield, and industry, have learned to effectively drill and complete horizontal wells. We drilled our first well in late 2008 and were encouraged with our success. The list below shows information on all seven of our completed wells to date.
 
 
6
 
 
 
Newfields gross drill and complete costs in the Granite Wash to date have averaged about $10 million. The Companys most recent well, the Williams 33-7H, was drilled and completed for $7.4 million. Our lateral lengths to date have been between 2,900 and 3,900. In the second half of 2009, we expect to drill lateral lengths up to 5,000, utilizing our learning curve from the Woodford Shale. Longer lateral completions, lower rig rates and ongoing efficiency gains are expected to further improve returns in the play.
 
Due to the success of our early drilling results, we added additional Granite Wash wells into our 2009 budget. We shifted an operated rig from our South Texas area to the Stiles Ranch field. Today we are running 3 operated rigs in the field, all of which are drilling horizontal wells. We expect to run at least three operated rigs in the field for the remainder of the year. We have an approximate 80% interest in the field.
 
We have a deep inventory of drilling locations today that should allow us to run a 3-5 operated rig program for the next several years. Our geoscientists are doing detailed field studies today to more accurately determine how many locations ultimately exist.
 
 
 
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
 
Monument Butte Field
Monument Butte field production is approximately 16,000 BOPD gross. Oil sales currently equal production. Due to increased demand for Black Wax, we sold nearly 300,000 barrels from inventory in the first half of 2009. Since the beginning of 2009, we have been running three operated rigs, down from five in 2008. Increased demand has led to an improvement in Black Wax differentials to about $12-13 below NYMEX (including transportation). We are planning to add a fourth operated rig in the field in the third quarter of 2009.
 
7
 
Drilling and completion costs in the Monument Butte field have fallen significantly. We are today drilling our 40 acre-spaced vertical wells for approximately $685,000 and our directional 20 acre-spaced locations for about $930,000. Our returns in the Monument Butte field are among the highest in our Company.
 
Williston Basin 
 
We have approximately 500,000 net acres in the Williston, with 200,000 acres in prospective development regions (primarily North Dakota). We are focused primarily on the Bakken Shale and Three Forks/Sanish formations. Based on our success to date, we have a growing inventory of locations in the region. We are operating a one-rig program in the Williston today with plans to increase activity in 2010.
 
 
 
 
8
 
We have drilled 11 successful wells (eight in the Bakken and three in the Sanish/Three Forks).  Our last three wells have all tested more than 1,000 BOEPD over a peak 24-hour period. We are developing our geologic information in the area and drilling our wells more effectively and with increased efficiency. The success of our drilling program this year is setting up our development plans for 2010 and beyond. We have nine planned wells in 2009 and more than 20 in 2010.
 
The following table shows our Williston Basin results to date.
 
 
 
Our gross operated production is approximately 4,000 BOPD. Differentials in the Williston Basin today are approximately $8 per barrel, which is a significant improvement from year-end 08.
 
 
GULF OF MEXICO
 
 
We recently announced the Pyrenees discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Since the beginning of 2008, we have drilled seven successes out of eight exploration attempts in the deepwater Gulf and have seven deepwater developments underway, providing significant future production growth (TABLE BELOW).
 
The Pyrenees discovery met our pre-drill expectations with the first well. The discovery found 125 of net pay in three separate intervals. Additional amplitudes are also prospective, providing significant potential upside to this discovery. The partners recently contracted a deepwater rig and a sidetrack is now underway. The sidetrack will test both shallow and deeper objectives in the Pyrenees complex. Pyrenees is located in approximately 2,100' of water in Garden Banks Block 293. We operate with a 40% working interest.
Pyrenees.
 
In the March 2009 GOM lease sale, we won four additional leases around Pyrenees. We now have an 11 contiguous block area with significant exploration potential remaining. Two new prospects include Mastiff and Saluki. Each of these is 200-400 Bcfe in pre-drill potential. We expect to sell down its existing interests on a promoted basis. We have an 85% interest in Mastiff and a 100% interest in Saluki. These prospects could be tested as early as 2010 depending on rig availability and partners.
 
The map below shows the 11-block Pyrenees complex, including the Mastiff and Saluki prospects.
 
 
 
9
 
 
We announced two exploration discoveries in as many attempts in the first half of 2009. The second discovery was Winter, located at Garden Banks 605 in about 3,400 of water. The well found about 44 of net hydrocarbon pay in two sands. The partners are exploring several viable development options through a tie back to existing infrastructure. First production is expected in 2011. We are the operator of Winter with a 30% working interest.

Over the last several years, we have assembled a substantial inventory of exploration prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We own interests in 88 deepwater blocks (approximately 500,000 gross acres). We plan to drill 3-5 deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells each year for the next several years.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Malaysia
 
Liftings from our Malaysian operations increased 86% in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. We are producing more than 35,000 BOPD gross, (nearly 20,000 BOPD net) from seven shallow water oil fields on blocks, PM 318 and PM 323. Despite the allocation of less capital to our international operations in 2009, we are benefiting from the significant investments we made in shallow water developments over the last several years. We have multiple development opportunities remaining on our shallow water blocks. We have ongoing developments on PM 318, PM 323 and PM 329 that will add additional production in 2010 and beyond.

China
Current gross production from our fields in Bohai Bay is 19,000 BOPD, or approximately 2,000 BOPD net to our interest. 
In the Pearl River Mouth Basin, we are currently testing a recent appraisal well  the LF 7-1-1. The well was added into this years budget and will appraise a 2008 discovery -- the LF 7-2-1. We have a 100% working interest in the well; CNOOC has a 51% back-in election to any commercial development.

Although Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil Newfield produces from its Monument Butte field in Utah, the availability and cost of capital resources, labor conditions and severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes). In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
