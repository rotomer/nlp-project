Third Quarter 2009
For the third quarter of 2009, Newfield recorded net income of $78 million, or $0.58 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Net income includes the effect of the following items:
 
Without the effect of these items, net income for the third quarter of 2009 would have been $209 million, or $1.58 per share.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2009 were $375 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $451 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Newfields production in the third quarter of 2009 was 65.5 Bcfe, an increase of 7% over the third quarter of 2008. Newfields oil liftings in the third quarter were 3.8 MMBbls, or an average of approximately 41,300 BOPD. This represents a 40% increase over the same period in 2008 and is primarily attributable to the timing of international oil liftings. Natural gas production in the third quarter was 42.5 Bcfe, an average of 462 MMcf/d, and excludes approximately 2.6 Bcfe of voluntary natural gas curtailments due to low natural gas prices. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2009 were $285 million.

Two wells were drilled since the second quarter 2009. The first was an exploratory well in the Big Valley area, covering more than 50,000 net acres in northern North Dakota. The well recently commenced production and continues to clean-up following fracture stimulation. Results warrant additional exploratory drilling to assess this large area. The second well was drilled in the Catwalk area, which covers 25,300 net acres. Completion operations on the well are expected to commence next week.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2009 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
The determination of Net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives for the third quarter of 2009 is as follows:
(1)
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

ENTERING THE MARCELLUS SHALE
 
On October 14, we entered the Marcellus Shale through a joint exploration agreement with Hess. The agreement covers up to 140,000 gross acres primarily in Susquehanna and Wayne Counties, Pennsylvania.We will operate with a 50 percent interest.Initial drilling is not expected to commence until 2010.
 
 
 
Our proven expertise from large scale developments like the Woodford Shale, Granite Wash and Monument Butte ranks us among a handful of companies that have developed large-scale unconventional plays. We have drilled approximately 300 horizontal wells in the Woodford and over a four-year time span held substantially all of 165,000 net-acre position by production. Our field production today is 317 MMcfe/d gross and we have firm transportation agreements in place to keep pace with our future growth. These activities have led to the development of core competencies within our company that will guide our success in the Marcellus.
 
The 2009 portion of our Marcellus Shale activities, estimated at approximately $20 million, will be funded within our existing $1.45 billion capital budget. We expect to grow our business in the Marcellus play, just as we have created businesses with scale in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains.
 
 
MID-CONTINENT
 
Mid-Continent gross operated production recently reached a new high and is currently 460 MMcfe/d, or 323 MMcfe/d net during the third quarter.  The significant increase is primarily attributable to curtailed wells that are being turned to sales, as well as initial production from deferred completions. Newfield has a remaining inventory of 30 wells (28 Woodford and 2 Granite Wash) that have been drilled but not completed. Completions are commencing and will continue through January 2010.
 
Woodford Shale
 
Gross operated production in the Woodford Shale set a recent new high, and today is 308 MMcfe/d, up nearly 30% from 240 MMcfe/d at the end of the second quarter. We have drilled approximately 300 horizontal wells and continue to make improvements in both drilling and completion operations. In 2008, we entered development mode in the Woodford and continued efficiency gains have been demonstrated through pad drilling, longer laterals and completion optimization.
2
We are operating 10 rigs under term contract, with three of the remaining rigs rolling off of term in November and December 2009. Spot market rates on these rigs are significantly lower than term rates.
Over the last several years, we have increased our lateral lengths significantly. We expect that our average completed lateral length will be more than 5,000 in 2009. The following chart shows the significant increase in lateral length by year:
Shown another way in the chart below, the increasing lateral lengths are leading to marked improvements in finding and development costs. Over the last 12 months, our completed wells costs are down more than 25%.
We are referring to our wells with laterals exceeding 8,000 as super extended laterals or SXLs. Regulatory rules in Oklahoma allow for drilling on stand-up 640 acre units or units that are -mile wide by 2-miles long. This configuration accommodates a 10,000 lateral. We have drilled two 10,000 laterals to date and expect to have eight SXLs drilled by year-end 09. These wells have planned lateral lengths between 8,000 and 9,000. Initial production data from the first SXLs are expected in late 2009.
3
We also are fracture stimulating our wells with greater efficiency in 2009. The average number of fracs per day has increased to more than five on recent pad completions, compared to just three fracs per day in 2008. This eliminates approximately six days off a standard completion; saving money and allowing us to turn wells to production more quickly.
 
One of the largest contributors to our Woodford cost reductions has been pad drilling - -- a common development technique in resource plays. Now that approximately 95% of our acreage is held-by-production, our development drilling is dominated by multi-well pads. Approximately 85% of our wells in 2009 will be drilled from common pad locations.
 
Two recent notable Woodford wells that typify increased cost efficiencies include:
 
The new Mid-Continent Express Pipeline (MEP) links our Woodford production to Perryville, La. For 2009, we have 310 MMcf/d of firm transportation on MEP and an additional 50 MMcf/d on CEGT. We have staged additional firm transportation on Boardwalk to coincide with our future growth needs. In total, we have approximately 650 MMcf/d of firm transportation, helping to ensure we obtain the best possible pricing for our Woodford gas.
 
The Granite Wash
 
Based on the success of our initial drilling program in the Granite Wash play, we added a fourth operated rig in our Stiles Ranch field, located in Wheeler County, Texas. In July, we announced that the first seven horizontal wells in our Stiles Ranch field had an average initial production rate of 22 MMcfe/d. Recent well completions have been deferred and the Company expects to have production results from 6  8 additional completions in early 2010.
 
We have increased lateral lengths on recent wells to approximately 4,000, compared to about 3,500 on average for our initial seven wells.
 
(For additional information on Granite Wash, please see @NFX July 22, 2009 and the Granite Wash feature in Oil and Gas Investor magazine, October 2009.)
 
 
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
 
Monument Butte Field
 
Despite dropping two operated rigs in Monument Butte in early 2009, production from our Rocky Mountain division is expected to be up about 9% in 2009.  Due to higher oil prices and improved differentials, we recently added a fourth rig at Monument Butte and expect to add a fifth rig in early 2010. Monument Butte production is approximately 16,000 BOPD gross and a five-rig program is expected to grow annual volumes by more than 10%.
4
 
Monument Butte Well Costs
 
 
       
Differentials for Black Wax crude have narrowed in 2009. The chart below shows our position in the overall Black Wax market and in that area refining capacity has been increasing. Monument Butte is a giant resource with more than 2 billion barrels in place. Through the drilling of several thousand additional wells, we expect to recover 18-20% of the original oil in place. We have more than a decade-long inventory of drilling locations and significant growth through this large oil asset.
Williston Basin 
We expect to add up to two additional operated rigs in our Williston Basin development areas. We have been running a one-rig program since early 2009. We have approximately 200,000 net acres in prospective development areas, located primarily on the Nesson Anticline and west of the Nesson. An additional 200,000 net acres are located in northern Montana where several exploration plays are underway. We have drilled 12 successful oil wells in the North Dakota portion of the Williston, focusing to date primarily on the Bakken Shale and Three Forks/Sanish formations.
5
Two wells were drilled since the last quarters update: Trigger is our first well in Big Valley, an area covering more than 50,000 net acres in northern North Dakota. The well was recently fracture stimulated and continues to clean-up. Early results warrant additional drilling to asses this large area. Sergeant Major was drilled in the Catwalk area, which covers 25,300 net acres. Completion operations on the well are expected to commence next week.
 
 
GULF OF MEXICO
 
We have seven deepwater developments underway in the Gulf of Mexico which are expected to provide significant future growth. Our most recent development is Fastball, located at Viosca Knoll 1003. Fastball commenced production on October 19. Gross production is expected to ramp up to 40 MMcf/d and 3,200 BOPD. We operate Fastball with a 66% interest.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, we announced a significant operated discovery on its Pyrenees Prospect, located at Garden Banks 293 in approximately 2,100 feet of water. A recent sidetrack delineated the downdip limits in the three proven pay sands seen in the discovery well and provided encouragement for the exploration potential of both the shallow and deep sand sections on the feature. Additional drilling is planned for 2010. We operate the development with a 40% working interest.
Pyrenees
--
 
Over the last several years, we have assembled a substantial inventory of exploration prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We own interests in 88 deepwater blocks (approximately 500,000 gross acres). We plan to drill 3-5 deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells each year for the next several years.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
International oil liftings in the third quarter of 2009 increased more than 90% over the same period in 2008. We lifted 2.1 MMBbls in the third quarter, or an average of 23,380 BOPD net. The increased liftings reflects production recent developments offshore Malaysia as well as timing of liftings in the quarter.
 
Malaysia
 
During the third quarter, liftings from Malaysia average 21,270 BOPD net. Production increases are attributable to higher rates from the East Belumut and Chermingat oil fields. We recently accelerated the timing of our planned East Belumut Phase II program, with plans to drill six development wells in late 2009 and an additional six wells in 2010. We expect to invest approximately $18 million in 2009 and $18 million in early 2010 associated with Phase II. Our developments are located on two shallow water blocks  PM 318 and PM 323. We have a 50% interest in PM 318 and a 60% operated interest in PM 323.
 
China
For the third quarter of 2009, our offshore China liftings averaged 2,108 BOPD net. We recently announced a significant operated oil discovery on our Pearl prospect, located in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. The Pearl development is underway with first production expected in 2012. The LF 7-1 well encountered more than 250 of high-quality oil pay in multiple sands and tested a single zone at 6,000 BOPD, which was the maximum limit of the test equipment on location. The well was an exploration offset to a downthrown anticline and was an offset to our 2008 oil discovery  the LF 7-2.  The two successes confirmed a commercial oil development with first production expected in late 2012. There is significant additional reserve potential in deeper objectives at Pearl, as well as with prospects along a structural ridge located to the northeast. We call these our Jade prospects.
6
Prior to year-end 2009, we expect to spud an exploration well on our first Jade prospect. We have a 100% working interest in the Pearl development; CNOOC has a 51% back-in election to any commercial development.
