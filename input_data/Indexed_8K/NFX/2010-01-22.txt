Exhibit 1.1
Execution Version
January 20, 2010
To the Representatives of the several Underwriters named in the respective Pricing Agreements hereinafter described
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     From time to time Newfield Exploration Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities"), specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Designated Securities"). If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional principal amount of Securities specified in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (the "Optional Designated Securities"). The Firm Designated Securities and the Optional Designated Securities, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively referred to as the "Designated Securities."
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing Agreement.
     1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Designated Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities, the maximum principal amount of Optional Designated Securities, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional Designated Securities or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated
 
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm Designated Securities and Optional Designated Securities, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus (as defined) with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement, including a prospectus, (File No. 333-150622) on Form S-3, relating to securities of the Company, including the Securities, to be issued from time to time by the Company. The registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement, including the information (if any) deemed to be part of the registration statement at each time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430A or Rule 430B under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus covering the Securities dated May 2, 2008 in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available to the Underwriters by the Company to meet requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Designated Securities (or in the form first made available to the Underwriters by the Company to meet requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," and the term "preliminary prospectus" means any preliminary form of the Prospectus. For purposes of this Agreement, "free writing prospectus" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and "Time of Sale Prospectus" means the preliminary prospectus together with the free writing prospectuses, if any, prepared by or on behalf of the Company or used or referred to by the Company in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), and any other documents or information identified in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "effective date" or "time of effectiveness" means any date as of which any part of the Registration Statement became, or is deemed to have become, effective under the Securities Act (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any effective date with respect to the Underwriters). As used herein and in the Pricing Agreement, the terms "Registration Statement," "Basic Prospectus," "preliminary prospectus," "Time of Sale Prospectus" and "Prospectus" shall include the documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. The terms "supplement," "amendment," and "amend" as used herein with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus shall include all documents subsequently filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
 
     2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
     (a) The Registration Statement has become effective. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, and no proceeding for such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or relating to any offering has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof; and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company;
     (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus;
     (c) (i) The Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus conform, and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; (ii) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, did not contain, and each such part, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (iii) the Time of Sale Prospectus did not, at the Time of Sale, as then amended or supplemented by the Company, if applicable, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (iv) the Prospectus, as of its date and the Time of Delivery, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
 
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to (A) any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or (B) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee;
     (d) The Company is not an "ineligible issuer" in connection with the offering pursuant to Rules 164, 405 and 433 under the Securities Act. Any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) has been, or will be, filed with the Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act complies or will comply, when issued or filed pursuant to Rule 433, in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Except for the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, identified in Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement and electronic road shows each furnished to the Representatives before first use, the Company has not prepared, used or referred to, and will not, without your prior consent, prepare, use or refer to, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws to which they may be subject; and the Company, its subsidiaries and their affiliates have instituted and maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to continue to ensure, continued compliance therewith.
     3. Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Firm Designated Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Designated Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus.
     The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Overallotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities set forth in such Pricing Agreement, on the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Designated Securities in excess of the Firm Designated Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Designated Securities may be exercised by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Designated Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement.
     The principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be added to the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter; provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the principal amount of Optional Designated Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Designated Securities which the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine to the nearest 1,000 dollars). The total principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate principal amount of Optional Designated Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase.
     4. Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in the form specified in such Pricing Agreement, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of the Underwriters, against payment by the Underwriters or on their behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance as specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Designated
 
Securities, all in the manner and at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery," and (ii) with respect to the Optional Designated Securities, if any, in the manner and at the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Designated Securities, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First Time of Delivery, being herein called the "Second Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery."
     5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities:

     (c) If at any time prior to any Time of Delivery any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law;
     (d) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Designated Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus or file a new registration statement to replace the Registration Statement in order to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission, have declared or deemed effective (if applicable) and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which the Designated Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, or such replacement registration statement will comply with applicable law.
 
     (e) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

     (g) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Securities Act);
     (h) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives, (ii) the last Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities and (iii) any period specified in the Pricing Agreement, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Designated Securities without the prior written consent of the Representatives;

     (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company and the officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees
 
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim, and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii) hereof in respect of such action or proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Tudor Pickering in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control Tudor Pickering within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
 
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Designated Securities and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter or any affiliates of such Underwriter who purchase Designated Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms.
 
In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased is not 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased is 10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Designated Securities or to such Optional Designated Securities, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
     11. (a) The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities.
          (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities: (1) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person; (2) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any; and (3) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities.
     12. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Designated Securities or Optional Designated Securities with respect to which such Pricing Agreement shall have been terminated except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, including failure of the conditions in Section 7 hereof, the Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or communication constituting such Questionnaire, or otherwise furnished to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
     14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Designated Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign of such persons by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

January 22, 2010
Base Indenture and the form of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, and (vii) such other certificates, instruments and documents as we considered appropriate for purposes of the opinions hereafter expressed. In addition, we reviewed such questions of law as we considered appropriate.
     As to any facts material to the opinions contained herein, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or other representatives of the Company.
     In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) all information contained in all documents reviewed by us is true and correct; (ii) all signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine; (iii) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the originals of those documents; (iv) each natural person signing any document reviewed by us had the legal capacity to do so; (v) each person signing in a representative capacity any document reviewed by us had authority to sign in such capacity; (vi) all Notes will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement; (vii) the Fifth Supplemental Indenture will be duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto in substantially the form reviewed by us or with changes that do not affect the opinions given hereunder; and (viii) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the underwriters named therein.
     Based upon such examination and review and the foregoing assumptions, we are of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed and issued by the Company and duly authenticated by the Trustee and paid for by the underwriters as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     The foregoing opinion is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of any document, instrument or security may be limited by or subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding of equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
     We express no opinion concerning (i) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law or (ii) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.

We do not express any opinions as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on even date herewith. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder.
