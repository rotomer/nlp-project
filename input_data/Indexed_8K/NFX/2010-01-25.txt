Consolidated Coverage Ratio
     (1) if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has Incurred any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period that remains outstanding or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio is an Incurrence of Indebtedness, or both, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to such Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof as if such Indebtedness had been Incurred on the first day of such period and such proceeds had been applied as of such date;
     (2) if the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged any Indebtedness since the beginning of such period or if any Indebtedness is to be repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged on the date of the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the Consolidated Coverage Ratio, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis as if such discharge had occurred on the first day of such period and as if the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary had not earned the interest income actually earned (if any) during such period in respect of cash or Temporary Cash Investments used to repay, repurchase, defease or otherwise discharge such Indebtedness;

continuing Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale);
     (4) if, since the beginning of such period, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise) shall have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) or an acquisition of material assets, including any acquisition of assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a calculation to be made under the Indenture, which constitutes all or substantially all of an operating unit of a business, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Investment or acquisition had occurred on the first day of such period; and
     (5) if, since the beginning of such period, any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) shall have made any Asset Disposition, any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (3) or (4) above if made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period, then EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Asset Disposition, Investment or acquisition had occurred on the first day of such period.
     For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Indebtedness Incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting Officer. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness, but if the remaining term of such Interest Rate Agreement is less than 12 months, then such Interest Rate Agreement shall only be taken into account for that portion of the period equal to the remaining term thereof).
     The Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, the outstanding principal balance of which is required to be computed on a pro forma basis in accordance with the foregoing, shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period; provided, however, that such average daily balance shall take into account the amount of any repayment of Indebtedness under such revolving credit facility during the applicable period to the extent such repayment permanently reduced the commitments or amounts available to be borrowed under such facility.

     (1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Capital Stock has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), including through a merger or consolidation, if in connection therewith the Company complies with its obligations under Section 1014 in respect of such disposition, the resulting or surviving Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary Guarantor was organized or under the laws of the United States of America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty;
     (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the resulting or surviving Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and
     (3) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation or merger and such Guaranty Agreement comply with this Indenture.

Unsecured Indebtedness shall not be deemed to be subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured.
Section 1011.

          (F) $15.0 million.
     (b) The provisions of Section 1011(a) shall not prohibit:
     (1) any Restricted Payment made out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent issuance or sale of, or made by conversion into or exchange for, Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees) or a substantially concurrent cash capital contribution received by the Company from one or more of its shareholders; provided, however, that (A) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and (B) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or such cash capital contribution (to the extent so used for such Restricted Payment) shall be excluded from the calculation of amounts under Section 1011(a)(3)(B);

     (7) the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Capital Stock in connection with any transaction otherwise permitted under this Section 1011; provided, however, that such payment will be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;
     (8) upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or an Asset Disposition and within 60 days after the completion of the offer to repurchase the 6/% Notes pursuant to Section 1014 or 1016 (including the purchase of all 6/% Notes tendered), any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or other retirement for value of Subordinated Obligations required pursuant to the terms thereof as a result of such Change of Control or Asset Disposition at a purchase or redemption price not to exceed 101% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any; provided, however, that (A) at the time of such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom), and (B) such purchase,

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the assets proposed to be transferred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with the Restricted Payment.
For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 1011, in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Restricted Payments described above, the Company, in its sole discretion, may order and classify such Restricted Payment in any manner in compliance with this Section 1011.

Section 1014.
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.
     (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:
     (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value (including the value of all non-cash consideration) as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, an Officer or an officer of such Restricted Subsidiary with responsibility for such transaction, which determination shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision, of the shares or assets subject to such Asset Disposition;
     (2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, oil and natural gas properties or capital assets to be used by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the Oil and Gas Business; and
     (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be)
          (A) , to the extent the Company so elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), to prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (other than Subordinated Obligations or Disqualified Capital Stock) or any Indebtedness (other than Disqualified Stock) of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; or
first
 
     (B) , to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent the Company so elects, to acquire Additional Assets or make capital expenditures in the Oil and Gas Business within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; or
second
     (C) , to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to make an offer to the Holders of the 6/% Notes (and to holders of other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company designated by the Company) to purchase 6/% Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to and subject to the conditions of this Section 1014;

, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A) or (C) of this Section 1014(a)(3), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased.
provided, however
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1014, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 1014 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 1014(a) exceeds $100 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 1014(a), such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
For the purposes of clause (a)(2) of this Section 1014, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: (1) the release of, pursuant to a novation or other agreement, or the discharge of, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; and (2) securities received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 120 days of their receipt.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1014 shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
The requirement of Section 1014(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement.
 
     (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of 6/% Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 1014(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase 6/% Notes (the "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and will purchase 6/% Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer by the Company for the 6/% Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of 6/% Notes and any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company shall select the 6/% Notes and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the 6/% Notes shall be denominations of $2,000 principal amount or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. The Company shall not be required to make such an Offer to purchase 6/% Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 1014 if the Net Available Cash available therefor is less than $100 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition).

The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision and all instructions and materials necessary to tender 6/% Notes pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3).

On or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Purchase Date, the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made
 
with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the 6/% Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the 6/% Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the 6/% Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period. Upon completion of an Offer, Net Available Cash shall be deemed to be reduced by the Offer Amount.

     (6) reasonable fees and reasonable compensation paid to, and indemnity and similar arrangements provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company's senior management; and

The Company shall not pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6/% Notes or any other payment obligation in respect of the 6/% Notes (including any obligation to purchase the 6/% Notes) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Four or Thirteen and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any 6/% Notes (collectively, "pay the 6/% Notes") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs: (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the 6/% Notes without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.

During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the 6/% Notes for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and the Company of a written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents.

Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be permitted to resume payments on the 6/% Notes after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The 6/% Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect.

When Distribution Must Be Paid Over; Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness.
If a distribution is made to Noteholders that because of this Article Fourteen should not have been made to them, the Noteholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of the Company as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred.
Section 1406.
Subrogation.
After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the 6/% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Fourteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the Company and Noteholders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.

     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Noteholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Noteholders.
Section 1408.

No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as provided in this Indenture will at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder of Senior Indebtedness may have or otherwise be charged with.
Section 1409.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent; Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
Notwithstanding Section 1403, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the 6/% Notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Fourteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Fourteen. The Company, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.
The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time subject to the terms of such Senior Indebtedness, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Noteholders, without incurring responsibility to the Noteholders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Indenture or the obligations hereunder of the Noteholders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following:
     (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding or secured;
 
     (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
     (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and
     (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person.
Section 1410.
Distribution or Notice to Representative.
Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Section 1411.
Article Fourteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate.
The failure to make a payment pursuant to the 6/% Notes by reason of any provision in this Article Fourteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default.

Section 1413.
Trustee Entitled to Rely.
Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 1402 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Fourteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in
 
such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 601 and 603 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Fourteen.

Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.

Section 1415.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Noteholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise.
Section 1416.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions.
Each Noteholder by accepting an 6/% Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the 6/% Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

Subsidiary Guaranties.
     (a) The Original Indenture is amended with respect to the 6/% Notes by adding Articles Fifteen and Sixteen as follows:

Section 1501.
Guaranties.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the 6/% Notes when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the 6/% Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the 6/% Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guarantied
7

Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guarantied Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article Fifteen notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guarantied Obligation.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guarantied Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the 6/% Notes or the Guarantied Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the 6/% Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the 6/% Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guarantied Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 1506, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
7
8
7

Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guarantied Obligations.
Each Subsidiary Guaranty is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in Article Sixteen, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor giving such Subsidiary Guaranty and each Subsidiary Guaranty is made subject to such provisions of this Indenture.
Except as expressly set forth in Sections 1502 and 1506, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guarantied Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the 6/% Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, except for the payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations.
7
8
Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of
 
principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guarantied Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guarantied Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guarantied Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guarantied Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guarantied Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in respect of any Guarantied Obligations until payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations and all obligations to which the Guarantied Obligations are subordinated as provided in Article Sixteen. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guarantied Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article Five for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guarantied Obligations as provided in Article Five, such Guarantied Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section.
Section 1502.
Limitation on Liability.
Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guarantied Obligations with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Section 1503.
Successors and Assigns.
This Article Fifteen shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the 6/% Notes shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.

Section 1504.
No Waiver.
Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article Fifteen shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article Fifteen at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
Section 1505.
Modification.
No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article Fifteen, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Section 1506.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor.
Upon (1) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) and as permitted by this Indenture, (2) the liquidation and dissolution of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (3) the exercise by the Company of its option (A) to satisfy and discharge the Indenture with respect to the 6/% Notes pursuant to Article Four or (B) to effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance pursuant to Article Thirteen or (4) the designation of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Indenture and the 6/% Notes without any further action required on the part of the Trustee, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.

Section 1601.
Agreement to Subordinate.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Noteholder by accepting an 6/% Note agrees, that the payment of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (including any amounts in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6/% Notes and any other payment

obligation in respect of the 6/% Notes, including any obligation of the Company to purchase 6/% Notes) is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Sixteen, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantee of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and that the subordination is for the benefit of and shall be enforceable directly by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Guarantied Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor that is Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall rank senior to the Guarantied Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.

     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness before Noteholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any payment or distribution to which Noteholders would be entitled but for this Article Sixteen shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Noteholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as its Subsidiary Guaranty.
Section 1603.
Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor.
No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make any payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty, whether in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 6/% Notes or any other payment obligation in respect of the 6/% Notes (including any obligation of the Company to purchase 6/% Notes) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Four or Thirteen and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any 6/% Notes or other Guarantied Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or cash equivalents; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such

During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor of written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated: (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash or cash equivalents.
Notwithstanding the provisions described in the preceding paragraph, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be permitted to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period; provided, however, that in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect.

If a demand for payment is made by the Trustee on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article Fifteen, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand.
Section 1605.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over; Reinstatement of Senior Indebtedness.
If a distribution is made to Noteholders that because of this Article Sixteen should not have been made to them, the Noteholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear.
To the extent any payment of or distribution in respect of Senior Indebtedness (whether by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Guarantor as proceeds of security or enforcement of any right of setoff or otherwise) is declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be paid to any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, fraudulent conveyance or similar law, then if such payment
 
or distribution is recovered by, or paid over to, such receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other similar Person, the Senior Indebtedness or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred.
Section 1606.
Subrogation.
After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the 6/% Notes are paid in full, Noteholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article Sixteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Noteholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Noteholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding Section 1603, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article Sixteen would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article Sixteen. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Sixteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.
The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time subject to the terms of such Senior Indebtedness, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Noteholders, without incurring responsibility to the Noteholders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Indenture or the obligations hereunder of the Noteholders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following:
     (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding or secured;
     (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
     (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; and
     (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Subsidiary Guarantor and any other Person.
Section 1610.
Distribution or Notice to Representative.
Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Section 1611.
Article Sixteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment.
The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article Sixteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall have any effect on the right of the Noteholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
Section 1612.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from any money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article Four or Thirteen by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the 6/% Notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or subject to the
7
8
 
restrictions set forth in this Article Sixteen, and none of the Noteholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to any Subsidiary Guarantor or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other creditor of any Subsidiary Guarantor.
Section 1613.
Trustee Entitled to Rely.
Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 1602 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Noteholders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Sixteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Sixteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 601 and 603 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Sixteen.
Section 1614.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
Each Noteholder by accepting an 6/% Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article Sixteen and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
7
8
Section 1615.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor.
The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Noteholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Sixteen or otherwise.
Section 1616.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors on Subordination Provisions.
Each Noteholder by accepting an 6/% Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior
7
8
 
Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the 6/% Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

If specified Events of Default relating to the bankruptcy of the Company with respect to the 6/% Notes at the time Outstanding shall occur, the principal amount of all the 6/% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, will ipso facto, and without any action by the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. After any such acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 6/% Notes may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture.
