FOR IMMEDATE RELEASE
 
today announced that its proved reserves at December 31, 2009 were 3.6 Tcfe, a 23% increase over proved reserves at year-end 2008. Newfield replaced approximately 250% of 2009 production with the addition of new proved reserves, excluding the impact of new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reserve reporting rules. Substantially all of the reserve additions were from organic drilling programs. The Companys proved reserve life index of approximately 14 years reflects continued growth in longer-lived and more predictable resource plays.
Houston  February 16, 2010 --
Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
 
At year-end 2009, approximately 53% of the Companys proved reserves were proved developed and 72% were natural gas. Proved reserves in Newfields two largest divisions  the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountains  increased 34% and now represent more than 80% of the Companys total proved reserves.
 
For 2009, Newfield added 1,342 Bcfe of proved reserves, of which approximately half were related to recent changes in SEC reserve reporting rules expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one offset. Negative price and performance related revisions were 259 Bcfe and 125 Bcfe, respectively. Our proved developed reserves at year-end 2009 were 4% higher than our proved developed reserves at year-end 2008. Proved Oil & Gas Reserves and Capital Expenditures tables are included below in this release.
 
Newfield invested approximately $1.4 billion in 2009. Finding and development (F&D) costs in 2009, including price and performance revisions, averaged approximately $1.50 per Mcfe. Excluding the negative impact of price related reserve revisions, finding and development costs would have been approximately $1.18 per Mcfe. Seefound at the end of this release for a discussion of our calculation of F&D costs.
Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Without the benefit of the SEC rule change expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one offset, Newfields total proved reserves would have been flat, despite the significant drop in North American natural gas prices. The Companys finding and development costs without the benefit of the SEC rule change and excluding the price related revisions would have been approximately $2.73 per Mcfe. Assuming a natural gas price of $5.50 per MMBtu for year-end 2009 reserve calculations, substantially all of the price-related natural gas revisions would not have occurred.
 
The following table summarizes our total net natural gas equivalent proved reserves:
 
Oil and Gas Reserves
 
* Prices used for year-end 2009 reserve calculations: $3.87 per MMBtu and $61.14 per barrel, NYMEX adjusted for market differentials.
Recent Changes to SEC Guidelines
SEC reserve reporting guidelines changed significantly for year-end 2009 reserve calculations. These changes were intended to modernize reserve reporting methodology to better align them with changes in technology, current practices and development of new resource plays. When compared to 2008, the most significant changes for Newfield relate to the following:
Our 2009 proved reserve calculations are based on the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month natural gas and crude oil prices for the prior twelve months, or $3.87 per MMBtu and $61.14 per barrel, respectively, adjusted for market differentials. Under the previous SEC guidelines, period-end prices were used in the proved reserve calculations. In 2008, period-end prices used in the calculation were $5.71 per MMBtu (48% higher than year-end 2009) and $44.61 (27% lower than year-end 2009) per barrel, adjusted for market differentials.
Methodology for determining commodity prices 
Beginning at year-end 2009, proved undeveloped reserves were expanded beyond one direct offset to a proved well location. In Newfields Woodford Shale play and Monument Butte field, for example, extensive drilling to date has shown these to be continuous accumulations of oil and gas and undeveloped locations more than one direct offset from a producing well could meet the definition of proved reserves. Therefore, some additional proved undeveloped well locations were included in proved reserves.
Expanded guidelines on proved undeveloped reserves 
Beginning with the year-end 2009, SEC guidelines limit proved undeveloped reserves to those expected to be developed within five years. In long-lived resource plays with a lengthy inventory of drilling locations, such as our Woodford Shale and Monument Butte plays, this time limit may have a material impact on the total reserves that could have otherwise been recognized as proved.
Five-Year development cut-off 
 
 
Capital Expenditures
 
* Total costs incurred includes $124 million of capitalized interest and overhead and $19 million of asset retirement obligations
 
 
Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
 
Newfield believes that the analysis of F&D cost is a useful tool in helping to evaluate capital productivity. We calculate F&D cost by dividing development, exploitation and exploration capital expenditures by proved reserve additions for the period. Acquisitions, land, seismic and asset retirement obligations are included in the calculation. Due to the significant drop in commodity prices in early 2009, we have presented the F&D costs in this release both including and excluding the impact of negative price-related proved reserve revisions to highlight the impact that the significant drop in prices during 2009 had on net proved reserve additions and to help provide comparability with F&D costs in prior periods. The metrics provided in this release should be read and utilized in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the financial statements therein, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

2010 Production Guidance
Our production for 2010 is expected to be 278  288 Bcfe, an increase of 8  12% over 2009. In 2010, we will invest approximately 70% of our budget, or approximately $1 billion, in domestic resource plays. More than one-third of the budget will be directed to oil plays. Production by area is shown in todays @NFX publication.
2010 Capital Budget, Hedging and Liquidity
Newfields 2010 capital budget is $1.6 billion (including approximately $124 million in capitalized interest and overhead). This budget approximates the Companys estimate of 2010 cash flow from operations and includes approximately $100 million for planned activities on the acreage recently acquired in the Maverick Basin of Texas. The budget excludes our $215 million purchase price for our recent acquisition of assets in the Maverick Basin from TXCO Resources, Inc. As a comparison, Newfield invested $1.4 billion in 2009. Newfield plans to provide a detailed overview of its 2010 investments and activities by area in its conference call on February 17. Following Newfields recent issuance of senior subordinated notes, Newfield has no outstanding borrowings under its $1.25 billion credit facility.

RECENT ACTIVITTY BY AREA AND 2010 PLANS
 
ONSHORE TEXAS
 
For 2010, the primary focus of our activity will be on the acreage that we recently acquired in the Maverick Basin from TXCO Resources. This transaction closed on February 11, 2010. In 2010, we expect to invest approximately $100 million in the asset, with drilling programs beginning in the second quarter.
This transaction marked our entry into the Maverick Basin of Texas. We now have 300,000 net acres located primarily in Maverick and Dimmit Counties, Texas. Current production from the assets totals about 1,300 BOEPD. There are multiple geologic horizons on the acreage, with prospects ranging from dry gas to oil.  The following cross section details the prospective formations throughout our acreage.
Our 2010 plans are aggressive. We will begin work immediately and expect to be running at least three operated rigs here by summer. Our efforts will be primarily focused on three plays  the Eagle Ford, Pearsall Shales and the Georgetown formation.

MID-CONTINENT
 
Our net production from the Mid-Continent grew 18% in 2009. The growth is being driven by the Granite Wash and Woodford Shale plays. Gross production from the Mid-Continent is currently more than 500 MMcfe/d, or approximately 320 MMcfe/d net. Approximately 40% of our 2010 budget will be allocated to our activities in the Mid-Continent.
 
The Granite Wash
 
In todays fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings and operating release, we announced results from six additional completions in our horizontal Granite Wash play. In total, we have results from 13 Granite Wash horizontal completions. Average initial production rates for our first 12 wells was 20 MMcfe/d. Our 13 well, the Britt 8-6H, commenced production this week and the rate continues to rise following fracture stimulation. We have six additional horizontal Granite Wash wells that are in various stages of completion at this time. The following chart shows our results to date.
th
 
4
Since 2002, we have drilled approximately 150 vertical wells in our Granite Wash play (primarily Stiles/Britt Ranch fields, Wheeler County, Texas). We know from this drilling that there are multiple productive horizons within the four primary geologic targets  Marmaton, Red Fork, Cherokee and Atoka. In the table above, the wells with high condensate yields were located in the Marmaton, the shallowest of the four targets. Of our recent wells (6) were completed in the Atoka, a known dry-gas producer. We plan to drill horizontal wells in 4-6 additional horizons in 2010.
We continue to optimize our drilling and completion practices in the Granite Wash. Lateral lengths in our most recent wells are 4,300 - 4,700 and our best in class drill and complete costs to date is approximately $7.3 million. Our drill and case cost per lateral foot is down approximately 20% when comparing our first seven wells with our most recent wells.
We are running a four rig program today and expect that this level of activity will allow us to drill about 20 horizontal wells in 2010. Although extensive work is underway to determine our overall development plan, we estimate that there are about 250 remaining horizontal locations in our Granite Wash play. We have more than 40,000 net acres in this play.
The Woodford Shale
 
Our production in the Woodford continues to grow. Gross operated production is approximately 329 MMcfe/d, or approximately 191 MMcfe/d net. Our 2009 volumes in the Woodford grew 25% and we expect that our production will increase more than 25% during 2010. Today, we have 166,500 net acres in the play and substantially all of the acreage is held by production.
In 2010, we expect to run 6-8 operated rigs in our Woodford Shale area. Although this is fewer operated rigs than we have run in previous years, our efficiency gains are allowing us to drill and complete more lateral feet per year, per rig. The following chart depicts these efficiency gains.
 
5
We expect to drill approximately 50 horizontal wells in our Woodford play in 2010. Our average lateral length is expected to be approximately 6,000. We define wells with lateral lengths in excess of 5,000 as Super Extended Laterals, or SXLs. About one-third of our 2010 wells in the Woodford are expected to be SXLs. Our efficiencies have been improved through lengthened laterals and operational gains. Our average lateral length in 2009 was approximately 5,000, compared to an average of approximately 4,000 in 2008 and less than 2,500 in 2006-07.
 
To date, the Company has drilled 11 SXLs with an average lateral length of nearly 9,000. As previously reported, the first five SXL wells had average initial production rates of approximately 10 MMcfe/d gross. The remainder of the SXLs (6) are in various stages of completion.
 
Today, we have more than 300 horizontal wells producing in the Woodford Shale. Since October 2009, we have completed and turned a total of 34 Woodford wells to sales (SXLs, standard completions and multi-well pads).  The average initial gross production rate for all wells is 6 MMcfe/d. 
 
Since the beginning of 2009, our drill and complete costs in the Woodford have decreased about 20%.
ROCKY MOUNTAINS
 
Our net production from the Rocky Mountains grew 10% in 2009 and is expected to grow by a comparable amount in 2010. Nearly 25% of our 2010 budget will be allocated to our activities in the Rocky Mountains. Our primary areas of focus will be the Uinta, Williston and Southern Alberta Basins.
 
 
Monument Butte
 
Our largest oil asset is Monument Butte, located in the Uinta Basin of northeast Utah. The Monument Butte field covers approximately 180,000 net acres (includes 63,000 Ute Tribal acres). Our production from this field is currently 17,000 BOPD (gross). In 2010, we expect to run a 5-rig program and to drill about 275 wells. Our Monument Butte production is expected to increase 15% in 2010.
 
Recent drilling results on our Ute Tribal acreage have exceeded our expectations. To date, we have drilled 75 wells on this acreage, located north and adjacent to Monument Butte. We have two rigs active on this acreage today. Recent wells have stepped out as far as 10 miles from core development drilling areas and initial production rates have ranged from 100  1,500 BOPD. Our interest on the Ute Tribal acreage is approximately 70%. The following map shows our acreage in the Monument Butte area.
 
6
 
There are more than 1,300 producing wells in the Monument Butte field, of which approximately 900 have been drilled since we acquired the field in 2004. The average initial gross production rate for a typical Monument Butte well has ranged from 65  80 BOPD.
 
Williston / Southern Alberta Basins
 
Over the last several years, we have assembled a large acreage position in the Williston and Southern Alberta Basins. Newfield has approximately 150,000 net acres in prospective development areas, located primarily on the Nesson Anticline and west of the Nesson. In addition, Newfield owns interest in approximately 54,000 net acres in the Elm Coulee field. In addition, we have 221,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin of northern Montana. Our activity levels in these regions are increasing and we expect that our Williston production will grow by about 40% in 2010. We have more than 80 development locations, located primarily along the Nesson Anticline. Our current net production is approximately 3,000 BOEPD.
Due to strong oil prices, we recently increased our operated rig count in the Williston to three rigs. Two of the rigs will be dedicated to our development areas, located along the Nesson Anticline. The third rig will be used to continue to assess our acreage west of the Nesson. We have drilled 14 successful oil wells in the North Dakota portion of the Williston Basin since entering the region in late 2007. The following chart details our results to date:
 
7
 
In late 2009, we signed an agreement with the Blackfeet Nation, adding 156,000 net acres in the Southern Alberta Basin. This was additive to our existing acreage and we now own interests in 221,000 net acres in Glacier County, Montana. The area is geologically similar to the Williston Basin. Our prospective oil targets include: the Bakken, Three Forks and Lodgepole. We expect to begin assessment drilling in the region in April 2010 and, depending on success, plan to drill as many as 10 operated wells during 2010.
MARCELLUS SHALE / APPALACHIAN BASIN
 
In late 2009, we entered the Marcellus Shale through a joint exploration agreement with Hess. To date, we have leased interests in approximately 35,000 net acres, primarily in Susquehanna and Wayne Counties, Pennsylvania. We operate the venture with a 50 percent working interest.
 
We recently filed permits to drill up to 10 vertical assessment wells in Wayne County in 2010. Our first well is expected to spud this summer.
 
 
GULF OF MEXICO
 
Approximately 15% of our 2010 budget will be allocated to our activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our GOM production is expected to increase more than 60% in 2010. We have five active deepwater developments that we expect to add significant production growth in 2010 -12. In addition to these developments, we anticipate participating in 2-3 deepwater exploration wells in 2010.
 
GOM Deepwater Developments

2010 GOM Deepwater Exploration
 
Our 2010 planned exploration wells in the deepwater GOM are shown below:
 
Saluki prospect: Our operated Saluki prospect (Garden Banks 425) will spud in late February 2010. We have recently taken additional partners in the well and will have a 50% working interest (35% cost interest). The prospect is located in close proximity to our Pyrenees development.
 
Axe: Located in close proximity to our outside-operated Dalmatian development, Axe (DeSoto Canyon 4) is expected to spud in March 2010. We will have a 23% non-operated interest in Axe.
 
We expect to drill 1-2 additional deepwater prospects in 2010, including Lyell (Green Canyon 551) where we have a 25% substantially-carried interest.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Our international activities in 2010 will comprise about 15% of our planned capital budget. Our activities are focused solely on our offshore Malaysia and China assets (Bohai Bay and Pearl River Mouth Basin). Our production from our international division was up 40% in 2009. It is expected to decline in 2010, but will grow significantly in 2011 and 2012 due to new field developments.
 
 
 
 
Malaysia
 
Total liftings from Malaysia in 2009 totaled 5.3 MMBbls, or 14,500 BOPD (net). Our production benefitted from new developments East Belumut and Chermingat, located on PM 323.
 
 
 In late 2009, we accelerated planned development drilling in our East Belumut field, offshore Malaysia. We are now drilling our sixth of seven planned development wells from an existing platform. The program is expected to add approximately 1 MMBbls of incremental oil production in 2010 due to its accelerated timing. Our interest in PM 323, which we operate, is approximately 60%.
East Belumut and Chermingat

Phase II drilling operations on Newfields East Belumut platform
 
 
 in fact, we have been increasing our lateral lengths overseas, as well. Our development wells in the East Belumut field are all horizontal wells and recent completions are nearly 6,000.
Horizontal drilling is not only applied in U.S. resource plays
 
 
 
China
 
Our Bohai Bay production is approximately 2,500 BOPD net. We have a 12% non-operated interest in a unit where more than 20 planned development wells are expected to be drilled during 2010.
 
In the Pearl River Mouth Basin, our recent Jade exploration test was unsuccessful. The dry hole was drilled to test a fault separated structure approximately 10 miles northeast of our Pearl discovery. The well was drilled for approximately $10 million and material exploration opportunities remain in the area.
 
Our operated Pearl development is underway with first production expected in late 2012. We recently completed the first phase of the regulatory approval process, which we anticipate be concluded by the end of 2010.
 
We have two additional exploration wells planned offshore China in 2010

The following table details the expected impact to pre-tax income from the settlement of our derivative contracts, outlined above, at various NYMEX gas prices.
In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 15 Bcf of our natural gas production from January 2010 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.95 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.95 per MMBtu.
In the Mid-Continent, we hedged basis associated with approximately 12 Bcf of our anticipated Stiles/Britt Ranch natural gas production from January 2010 through August 2011.  In total, this hedge and the 30,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.52 per MMBtu.  We have also hedged basis associated with approximately 23 Bcf of our natural gas production from this area for the period September 2011 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu.
Approximately 12% of our natural gas production correlates to Houston Ship Channel, 13% to Columbia Gulf, 13% to Texas Gas Zone 1, 9% to Southern Natural Gas, 9% to Tenn 100, 5% to CenterPoint/East, 22% to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, 6% to Waha, 6% to Colorado Interstate, and 5% to others.

**This publication contains forward-looking information. All information other than historical facts included in this publication, such as information regarding estimated or anticipated first quarter 2010 results, estimated capital expenditures, cash flow, production and cost reductions, drilling and development plans and the timing of activities, is forward-looking information. Although Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, the availability of refining capacity for the crude oil Newfield produces from its Monument Butte field in Utah, the availability and cost of capital resources, labor conditions and severe weather conditions (such as hurricanes). In addition, the drilling of oil and gas wells and the production of hydrocarbons are subject to governmental regulations and operating risks.
