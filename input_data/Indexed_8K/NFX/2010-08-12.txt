*These 3-way collar contracts are standard natural gas collar contracts with respect to the periods, volumes and prices stated above. The contracts have floor and ceiling prices per MMMBtu as per the table above until the price drops below a weighted average price of $4.50 per MMMBtu. Below $4.50 per MMMBtu, these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are on average per MMMBtu higher than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized.
$1.27
The following table details the expected impact to pre-tax income from the settlement of our derivative contracts, outlined above, at various NYMEX gas prices, net of premiums paid for these contracts (in millions).
In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 12 Bcf of our natural gas production from August 2010 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.94 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.93 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
In the Mid-Continent, we hedged basis associated with approximately 8 Bcf of our anticipated Stiles/Britt Ranch natural gas production from August 2010 through August 2011.  In total, this hedge and the 30,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.52 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  We have also hedged basis associated with approximately 23 Bcf of our natural gas production from this area for the period September 2011 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
Approximately 17% of our natural gas production correlates to Houston Ship Channel, 13% to Columbia Gulf, 13% to Texas Gas Zone 1, 13% to Southern Natural Gas, 3% to Tenn 100, 5% to CenterPoint/East, 19% to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, 4% to Waha, 6% to Colorado Interstate, and 7% to others.
