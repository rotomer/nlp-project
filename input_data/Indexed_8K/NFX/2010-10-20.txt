Houston  October 20, 2010 
Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
http://www.newfield.com
Newfields third quarter 2010 total production was 71 Bcfe. Oil production in the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 MMBbls related to a damaged export pipeline offshore Malaysia, which has been repaired. Production in the third quarter of 2010 increased 9% over the third quarter of 2009. Domestic oil production in the third quarter of 2010 was up 30% over the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, Newfield expects that its production will be at the upper end of its guidance range, or 286 288 Bcfe, an increase of more than 11% over 2009 production. Newfields increase in guidance is attributable to higher oil production.
Rocky Mountains Oil Program
 
The centerpiece of Newfields domestic oil program is its Rocky Mountain region. Current net production from the area is nearly 25,000 BOEPD.
 
 Gross oil production from the Monument Butte field area has increased nearly 5,000 BOPD since the beginning of 2010. With a five operated rig program, Newfield is on track to drill a record 375 wells in the Monument Butte field in 2010. Newfield expects that it will average less than five days to drill and case a well in 2010. Recent completed well costs in Monument Butte continue to range from $700,000 $900,000 (gross).
Monument Butte Field Area
 
Recent drilling has focused on assessing the Companys northern extension acreage which covers 73,000 gross acres adjacent to the Greater Monument Butte Unit. Newfield has drilled more than 250 wells to date in this area and has successfully assessed more than 25% of the northern extension acreage. Newfields average working interest on the northern acreage is approximately 70%.
 
Based on its current pace of drilling activities, Monument Butte production is expected to grow about 20% in 2011 and firm oil sales agreements are in place on approximately 85% of the expected volumes. Newfield continues to work with area refiners and expects sufficient refining capacity to be in place in 2011 and beyond.
 
The Monument Butte field area covers approximately 180,000 gross acres. Newfield estimates that approximately 4,700 development drilling locations remain.
 
Newfield continues to run four operated rigs in the Williston Basin. Current net production is more than 5,000 BOEPD and is expected to exit 2010 at more than 6,500 BOEPD. Year-to-date, the Company has drilled 20 of its planned 29 wells.
Williston Basin
 
 
 
 
 
Newfield is currently operating three rigs west of the Nesson Anticline. Through a 10-well program, Newfield successfully assessed the Catwalk, Aquarium and Watford areas and has now entered the development drilling phase. The Company is today drilling or completing five wells with lateral lengths exceeding 9000.
 
Similar to the Companys Woodford Shale development, longer lateral completions have improved operating efficiencies in the Williston Basin. Year-to-date, Newfields drill and complete costs per lateral foot have averaged about $1,250 on its 4,000 lateral wells. The Company estimates that its drill and complete costs per lateral foot will reduce to approximately $900 on its 9,000 laterals. Year-to-date, gross completed well costs on 4,000 and 9,000 laterals have been approximately $5 million and $8 million, respectively. In 2011, substantially all of the Companys planned wells are anticipated to have completed lateral lengths of approximately 9,000.
 
Recent Williston Basin completed well results are included in the table below.
 
*recent completion, 30-day average production not yet available
International Oil Developments
 
Newfields international oil liftings in the third quarter were 1.3 MMBbls. The largest contributor to Newfields international oil production was Malaysia where liftings in the quarter averaged approximately 12,000 BOPD net. Liftings in the third quarter reflect approximately 0.3 MMBbls of deferred production related to a damaged offshore export pipeline in Malaysia in July 2010. The pipeline was repaired in approximately four weeks and production resumed in early August.
 
Oil Play Assessment Areas
 
Approximately $150 million of the Companys 2010 capital budget is dedicated to assessing new oil plays. The two largest efforts underway encompass nearly 600,000 net acres  the Eagle Ford Shale in southwest Texas and the Southern Alberta Basin of northwestern Montana.
 Newfield has more than 300,000 net acres in the Maverick Basin of southwest Texas. The acreage, located in Maverick and Dimmit Counties, is prospective for both the Eagle Ford and Pearsall Shales and an active drilling campaign is underway. To date, Newfield has completed and commenced production on four wells. An additional five wells are in various stages of completion. Newfields operated rig count has ranged from three to five rigs in recent months with plans to drill about 15 wells in 2010.
Eagle Ford Shale
 
 The Company recently completed a horizontal well in the Southern Alberta Basin. Newfield plans to drill up to eight wells to assess the oil potential on its more than 260,000 net acres in Glacier County, Montana. Prospective geologic formations included the Lodgepole, Middle Bakken, Three Forks and Nisku.
Southern Alberta Basin

Natural Gas Developments
 
 Newfield has drilled 31 horizontal wells (26 producing and five in various stages of completion) in the Granite Wash play. Current net production is approximately 115 MMcfe/d and Newfields working interest is about 70%.  The Company owns interests in approximately 46,000 net acres in the play.
Granite Wash
 
Gross initial production to date from the Companys Granite Wash horizontal wells has averaged approximately 17 MMcfe/d (24-hour rate). To date, 12 of the wells have been completed in the Marmaton formation where initial production has averaged approximately 15 MMcf/d and 620 BCPD. To date, 14 of the wells have been completed in the Red Fork/Atoka formations and initial production has averaged 16 MMcfe/d. Newfields acreage has multiple prospective drilling horizons. The Companys 2010 drilling program has successfully assessed nine horizons and an additional test is expected by year-end.  The remainder of the 2010 drilling program, as well as 2011s planned activities, will focus on the rich gas and condensate horizons in the Marmaton.
 
 Drilling activity in the Woodford Shale was slowed in early 2010 as a result of weak gas prices. Today, about 90% of Newfields 172,000 net acres in the Woodford Shale is held by production. Newfield is currently running four operated rigs in the Arkoma Basin.
Woodford Shale
 
Newfield has drilled over 350 horizontal wells in the Woodford to date. Development drilling is today exclusively focused on super extended laterals (SXLs), or wells with a horizontal length greater than 5,000. Newfield expects that its average Woodford lateral length in 2010 will be approximately 6,500.
 
The Companys Woodford production is approximately 190 MMcfe/d net. To date, the Company is producing from 17 SXLs and expects to have 21 SXLs producing by year-end 2010. The SXLs drilled to date have an average lateral length of approximately 8,400, with average gross initial production (24-hour rate) of nearly 8 MMcfe/d. Gross well costs for SXLs today average $8 $10 million, depending on completion type and lateral length.Newfields average working interest in the Woodford is about 70%.
 
 
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
 
The Companys deepwater Gulf of Mexico production is approximately 100 MMcfe/d net and represents about 10% of total Company production. The Companys Gladden oil development, located at Mississippi Canyon 800, is expected to commence production in December 2010 at approximately 4,750 BOPD gross. Newfield operates Gladden with a 57.5% working interest.
 
Newfield Exploration Company is an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company. The Company relies on a proven growth strategy of growing reserves through an active drilling program and select acquisitions. Newfield's domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains, onshore Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. The Company has international operations in Malaysia and China.

For the third quarter of 2010, Newfield recorded net income of $161 million, or $1.20 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Net income includes the effect of a net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $20 million ($13 million after-tax).
 Without the effect of this item, net income for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $148 million, or $1.10 per share.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2010 were $449 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $394 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Newfields production in the third quarter of 2010 was 71 Bcfe. Production results for the third quarter of 2010 include the impact of approximately 0.3 MMBbls of deferred production in Malaysia related to a damaged export pipeline. The pipeline was repaired during the third quarter and is now operational. Natural gas production in the third quarter of 2010 was 50 Bcf, an average of 548 MMcf/d. Newfields oil liftings in the third quarter of 2010 were 3.5 MMBbls, an average of approximately 38,000 BOPD. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2010 were approximately $386 million.
In 2010, we have focused on growing our oil production while improving our operating margins, said Newfield Chairman, President and CEO Lee K. Boothby. Our portfolio has attractive oil projects capable of growth and we allocated additional capital and people to these areas. Our 2010 domestic oil production is expected to rise nearly 25% over 2009 levels and we have great momentum entering 2011. Our gas assets are substantially held-by-production and we have the option to slow our investments in these regions while continuing to re-direct our focus to oil projects.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2010 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
 
 
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
