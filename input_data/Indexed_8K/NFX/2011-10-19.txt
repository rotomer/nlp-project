For the third quarter of 2011, Newfield recorded net income of $269 million, or $1.99 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Net income for the third quarter includes a net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $201 million ($129 million after-tax), or $0.95 per share. Without the effect of this item, net income for the third quarter of 2011 would have been $140 million, or $1.04 per share.
Revenues in the third quarter of 2011 were $628 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $409 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.

Newfield reiterated its 2011 capital budget of $1.9 billion, excluding capitalized interest and overhead and approximately $300 million in acquisitions. Proceeds from non-strategic asset sales year-to-date are approximately $200 million. The Company continues to market other certain non-strategic domestic assets with expected total proceeds for the year possibly reaching $400 - $550 million.
 
Operating Highlights:
 
Rocky Mountains
 
Uinta Basin
 
Newfield has approximately 250,000 net acres in the Uinta Basin, where gross production recently reached a high of 24,500 BOPD.
 
The Company recently completed several additional Wasatch wells in the Central Basin, an area located immediately north of its Monument Butte field. Notable completions include the Lamb 1-19-3-1W, which had 24-hour gross initial production of 1,168 BOEPD and a 30-day gross average of 617 BOEPD, the Padilla 1-18-3-2W, which had 24-hour gross initial production of 1,102 BOEPD and the Miles 15-8-3-2, which had 24-hour gross initial production of approximately 850 BOEPD. A recent best in class deep Wasatch well was drilled and cased in 13 days from spud to rig release. The Company plans to complete five additional Wasatch wells in the fourth quarter.
 
Newfield has drilled seven horizontal wells in the Uteland Butte to date and four additional wells are planned before year end. Initial gross 24-hour production rates from the first six wells averaged approximately 500 BOEPD. The 14-14T well has averaged more than 200 BOEPD (gross) over its first four months of production.
 
With the ongoing optimization of the drilling campaign, the Company expects to increase its operated rig count from an average historical five-rig program to at least eight rigs in 2012. As a result, oil production growth from the region is expected to increase more than 25% in 2012 over 2011.
 
Williston Basin
 
In response to service cost pressures, Newfield is voluntarily reducing its activities in the Williston Basin. The Company has reduced its operated rig count and is deferring 13 completions into early 2012. Well production performance continues to be at or above expectations.
 
Substantially all of the recent completions were super extended laterals. The table below shows notable recent wells drilled and completed on average for approximately $11 million:

Southern Alberta Basin
 
Newfield is nearing completion of its 2011 assessment program in the Southern Alberta Basin of northern Montana. To date, the Company has drilled seven vertical wells, two horizontal wells and is in the process of testing several vertical completions.
 
The Companys first horizontal well had initial gross production of approximately 225 BOEPD with less than one-third of the lateral producing. The second horizontal well was not fracture stimulated. Newfields average working interest is approximately 85%.
 
To date, three of the vertical wells have been tested and flowed low volumes of oil. Newfields work program to date satisfies about 80% of its commitments to hold its 340,000 acre position for a five-year period.
 
 
Mid-Continent
 
Woodford Shale
 
Newfield recently completed an additional seven wells in the oily portion of its Woodford Shale play, located in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma. To date, the Company has completed a total of 13 wells with an average 24-hour gross IP rate of more than 1,000 BOEPD. Average working interest for the 13 wells is approximately 90%.
 
Granite Wash
 
Newfields production in the Granite Wash play located in the Texas Panhandle is approximately 170 MMcfe/d gross (120 MMcfe/d net). The Company is currently running three operated rigs in the Granite Wash with its activities primarily located in Wheeler County, Texas. To date, the Company has completed 57 wells in the Texas Panhandle portion of the play with 24-hour gross initial production averaging approximately 15 MMcfe/d. Newfields average working interest in the play is approximately 80%.
 
 
Onshore Texas
 
Maverick Basin
 
Newfield continues to explore and assess its 335,000 net acre position in the Maverick Basin of South Texas. Recent drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale has focused on the southern portion of the Companys acreage along existing infrastructure. A pilot program in the West Asherton area (Dimmitt County, Texas) is underway with recent wells being drilled from pad locations to help determine optimal development spacing. To date, Newfield has completed 16 wells in West Asherton with average 24-hour gross initial production of 650 BOEPD. Estimated ultimate recovery from these wells is approximately 300 MBOE. The wells have been drilled in as few as seven days and gross completed well costs have averaged approximately $6.6 million.
Year-to-date, the Company has completed 24 wells in the Eagle Ford Shale, six wells in the Georgetown formation and two wells in the Pearsall Shale. Current gross production from the Maverick Basin is approximately 7,000 BOEPD. Newfields average working interest in the region is approximately 80%.
 
International Oil Developments
 
Third quarter 2011 net liftings from the Companys oil assets in Southeast Asia were 1.6 MMBbls, or an average of about 17,400 BOPD. Net liftings in Malaysia during the period averaged approximately 15,700 BOPD. On PM 329, the East Piatu development is expected to commence production later this week at about 10,000 BOPD (gross). Newfield has a 70% interest in East Piatu.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2011 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
 
The determination of Net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives for the third quarter of 2011 is as follows:
(1)
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

AN UPDATE ON RECENT OIL DEVELOPMENTS
UINTA BASIN
 
Our gross production in the Uinta Basin recently reached a high of 24,500 BOPD. Today, we are high-grading our rig fleet by adding increased horsepower rigs to drill deeper targets in the Central Basin. These rigs also will be capable of drilling horizontal wells in the geopressured Wasatch (planned for 2012). We expect to operate at least 8 rigs in the Uinta Basin in 2012.
 
We have more than 250,000 acres in the Uinta Basin and we believe that our assets have net undeveloped resource potential of more than 700 MMBOE in the proven horizons of the Green River, Wasatch and Uteland Butte.
 
 
 
1
 
 
 
The Wasatch formation is being developed throughout the Central Basin and is prospective at depths of 9,000  11,000 total vertical depth (TVD). Over the last year, 14 vertical wells have been drilled on our acreage.
 
We recently completed several additional Wasatch wells in the Central Basin. Notable wells include the Lamb 1-19-3-1W, which had 24-hour gross initial production of 1,168 BOEPD and a 30-day gross average of 617 BOEPD, the Padilla 1-18-3-2W, which had 24-hour gross initial production of 1,102 BOEPDand the Miles 15-8-3-2, which had 24-hour gross initial production of 850 BOEPD. A recent best in class deep Wasatch well was drilled and cased in 13 days from spud to rig release. We plan to complete five additional wells in the fourth quarter of 2011.

The Uteland Butte horizontal oil play is prospective between 6,000  9,000 TVD on approximately 80% of our total acreage in the Uinta Basin. Portions of the play are geopressured and wells drilled in these areas are expected to have both higher production and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR).
To date, we have drilled seven horizontal wells in the Uteland Butte play and four additional wells are planned before year end. All of the wells to date have been drilled in the Monument Butte field. Multiple tests are planned in 2012 in the Central Basin. Initial gross 24-hour production from our first six wells averaged 500 BOEPD. The 14-14T well averaged more than 200 BOEPD over the first four months.
 
WILLISTON BASIN
 
We recently completed 10 wells in the Williston Basin. Substantially all of our recent completions were super extended laterals. Recent wells were drilled and completed for approximately $11 million. Notable well results are included in the table below.
