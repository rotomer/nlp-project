 Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
 
Fourth Quarter 2011
 
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Newfield recorded net income of $68 million, or $0.51 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Net income for the fourth quarter includes a net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $93 million ($59 million after-tax), or $0.44 per share.  Without the effect of this item, net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been $127 million, or $0.95 per share.
 
Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $677 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $387 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Newfields oil and liquids liftings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were 6 MMBbls, or an average of approximately 64,000 BOPD. This is about 9,000 BOPD higher than the third quarter of 2011 and 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 44 Bcf, an average of 478 MMcf/d. When combined, Newfields production in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 79 Bcfe, of which 44% was oil and liquids. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $479 million.
 
Full-Year 2011
 
For 2011, Newfield recorded net income of $539 million, or $3.99 per diluted share. Revenues for 2011 were $2.5 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.5 billion. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Newfields production for the full year of 2011 was 300 Bcfe, an increase of 4% over 2010 production volumes. Oil and liquids production grew more than 20% over 2010 levels and comprised approximately 40% of the Companys total production. Production associated with approximately $400 million in non-strategic asset sales during the year would have contributed an additional 4 Bcfe. Capital expenditures for 2011 were approximately $2.2 billion, excluding acquisitions.
 
Year-End 2011 Reserves and Capital Expenditures
 
At year-end 2011, Newfields proved reserves were 3.9 Tcfe and probable reserves were 2.6 Tcfe. This reflects growth of 5% and 4%, respectively, over the prior year. The Companys proved oil reserves increased nearly 30% during 2011 while proved natural gas reserves declined by 6% as compared to year-end 2010. Proved developed reserves at year-end 2011 were 54% of total proved reserves. Newfields present value of its proved reserves discounted 10% (PV-10) increased by more than 20% over the prior year to approximately $6 billion (after-tax), which follows a more than 65% increase in PV-10 during 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
The following table details our proved reserves for the three years ended 2009-2011:
 
Proved Oil and Gas Reserves:
 
Newfields proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2011 were 2.3 Tcf compared to 2.5 Tcf at year-end 2010 and 2.6 Tcf at year-end 2009. The Companys proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year-end 2011 were 263 million barrels compared to 204 million barrels at year-end 2010 and 169 million barrels at year-end 2009. Natural gas comprised about 60%, 67% and 72% of proved reserves at year-end 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Our total proved reserve revisions in 2011 were 288 Bcfe. Price-related and other revisions were negligible. Of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves, 87 Bcfe were reclassified to probable reserves as the Company directed capital to higher margin oil drilling and the locations associated with these reserves moved outside of a five-year development horizon. Negative performance revisions in 2011 were 198 Bcfe, which included (i) well performance as efforts to extend the Greater Monument Butte Unit (GMBU) Green River section to the northwest encountered higher than expected gas production, (ii) the timing of waterflood response recognition in the GMBU, (iii) wellbore failures in gas reservoirs along the Gulf Coast and (iv) offset well interference in older vertical gas wells in the Mid-Continent, which were adversely impacted by new horizontal well completions.
Beginning with the year-end 2009, SEC guidelines limit proved undeveloped reserves to those expected to be developed within five years. In long-lived resource plays with a lengthy inventory of drilling locations, such as our Woodford Shale and Uinta Basin plays, this time limit may have a material impact on the total reserves that could otherwise be recognized as proved. At year-end 2011, a total of approximately 1.1 Tcfe, or 42%, of Newfields probable reserves meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for the fact that their planned development timing is beyond the prescribed five-year (2012-2016) development horizon for proved reserves.
2011 Capital Expenditures:

Operational Highlights:
 
Rocky Mountains
 
 Through several transactions in 2011, Newfield added more than 75,000 net acres in the Central Basin of Utah (north and adjacent to Monument Butte) and today owns interest in approximately 230,000 net acres in the Uinta Basin. The acquisition introduced additional play types including the Uteland Butte, Wasatch and Black Shale. Current Uinta Basin net oil production is approximately 22,000 BOEPD net.
Uinta Basin
 
The Uinta Basin will be the centerpiece of Newfields domestic oil growth in 2012.  With a planned 7-8 rig program, production from the area is expected to grow about 20% over 2011 levels. In the Central Basin, Newfield is currently drilling its first pressured well in the Uteland Butte and multiple horizontal tests of other pressured targets (Wasatch and Black Shale) are planned in 2012. Initial results from these wells are expected in the second quarter.
 
In late 2011 and early 2012, the Company announced two separate, long-term agreements (seven and 10 years beginning in 2013 and 2014, respectively) with Salt Lake City area refiners. These agreements captured 38,000 BOPD of refining capacity.
 
 Newfield owns approximately 100,000 net acres in the Williston Basin (includes 40,000 acres in Elm Coulee) where current net production is approximately 7,500 BOEPD. In late 2011, Newfield voluntarily slowed its drilling and completion activities in the Williston Basin. As a result, the completion of 17 wells was deferred into 2012. Subsequently, the Company monetized a 23,000 acre package in Williams County, North Dakota for $276 million.  Net production from these assets was approximately 300 BOEPD. Eight of the uncompleted wells were sold as part of this transaction. The remaining wells are planned for completion in the first half of 2012.
Williston Basin
 
In January 2012, Newfield resumed its activity levels in the Williston Basin. Six of the nine remaining deferred completions are in various stages and expected to commence production in the first half of 2012. Three recent wells have commenced production with average 24-hour initial production rates of 2,900 BOEPD. The Company plans to operate 2-4 drilling rigs in the Williston Basin throughout 2012 and production is expected to increase approximately 35% over 2011 levels.
 
Mid-Continent
 
As a result of low natural gas prices, Newfield is decreasing activities in the dry gas portion of the Woodford Shale (Arkoma Basin) and in the Granite Wash. In the first quarter of 2012, the Company curtailed approximately 2 Bcfe of production through the deferred timing of completions and shut-ins in the Mid-Continent. Natural gas production from the Mid-Continent region is expected to decline approximately 5-10% in 2012. Current net daily production in the region is approximately 350 MMcfe/d.
 
 Net production in the Granite Wash during 2011 averaged 105 MMcfe/d (current production is a record 150 MMcfe/d). In late 2011, eight completions were deferred into 2012 as the Company slowed activities in several areas to meet its capital budget. All of the deferred completions are now on-line. Newfield plans to reallocate capital in 2012 to the Cana Woodford play. Net production for the year in the Granite Wash is expected to average about 90 MMcfe/d, or a decrease of about 15% over 2011 levels. In the first quarter of 2012, Newfield expects to run a single-rig program, focused primarily on the condensate and liquids rich Marmaton formation in Stiles/Britt Ranch.
Granite Wash
 
 Net production in the Arkoma Woodford in 2011 averaged approximately 180 MMcfe/d (current net production is approximately 160 MMcfe/d). With current low gas prices, the Company has ceased drilling in the Arkoma Woodford for 2012 and expects that annual net production from the Woodford Shale will average about 160 MMcfe/d.
Woodford Shale
 
 Newfields drilling efforts have shifted from the Arkoma Woodford to the oil and liquids rich Cana Woodford, located in the Anadarko Basin. The Company assembled a 125,000 net-acre lease position as a southeast extension of this play in 2011. The Company plans to operate up to seven rigs in 2012 to assess this new acreage.
Cana Woodford

Onshore Gulf Coast
 
Current net daily production from the Onshore Gulf Coast region is approximately 85 MMcfe/d. Newfields active program in the Maverick Basin today encompasses more than 250,000 net acres. The Company plans to run a single-rig program in 2012 and test four super extended laterals (approximately 7,500 laterals) in the Eagle Ford Shale. Of the SXL wells, two have been drilled to date and are awaiting completion. In addition, tests are planned in the Austin Chalk, the Georgetown and Glen Rose formations.
 
International
 
Newfields net oil production today in Malaysia is at a record 29,000 BOPD. Production commenced in late 2011 from two new offshore developments  East Piatu and Puteri. East Piatu is today producing 12,500 BOPD gross and Puteri is producing 8,000 BOPD gross. Production from Malaysia in 2012 is expected to increase approximately 25% over 2011 levels.
 
In 2012, approximately $100 million will be invested in the development of the Pearl oil field, located offshore China in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. First production is expected in late 2013 or early 2014.
 
Gulf of Mexico
 
In early 2012, Newfield declared its Gulf of Mexico assets non-strategic and is currently exploring options to maximize value. For 2012, Newfields production is expected to decline approximately 10% from 2011 levels. The Companys Pyrenees development commenced production in February 2012 and is currently producing about 3,300 BOEPD net.
 
Newfield Exploration Company is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Our domestic areas of operation include the Mid-Continent, the Rocky Mountains and onshore Texas.  Internationally, we focus on offshore oil developments in Malaysia and China.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

Exhibit 99.2
today announced a $1.5  $1.7 billion capital investment program for 2012. The investments will be almost entirely oil-focused and are expected to generate more than 20% year-over-year production growth in oil and liquids. Approximately $300 million of the budget will be allocated to an aggressive assessment of a new 125,000 net-acre position in the liquids-rich Cana Woodford play, located in Oklahomas Anadarko Basin.

2012 Capital Investment Highlights
 
 
2012 Production Guidance
 
We are transitioning to an oil company in 2012 and by the second half of the year we expect that more than 50% of our production will be from oil and liquids fields, said Lee K. Boothby, Chairman, President and CEO.  With the continuing gap between oil and natural gas prices, we are voluntarily electing to defer natural gas activity in favor of more profitable oil and liquids opportunities. Because we took proactive steps over the last several years to build our oil assets, we have favorable areas to invest in today and expect that our oil and liquids volumes will grow more than 20% in 2012 from plays in the Uinta and Williston basins, the Anadarko Basin and from our international developments.
 
Boothby continued, Our natural gas production is expected to fall by approximately 15% in 2012 due to natural field declines. We are refusing to fund low margin natural gas projects simply for the sake of absolute production growth. I am confident that we are making the right long-term decisions for our shareholders. Overall, we expect that our production in 2012 will range from 290  300 Bcfe, or flat to slightly higher than our 290 Bcfe produced in 2011 (pro forma for asset sales). Year to date, we have already deferred about 2 Bcfe associated with curtailments and deferred completions in the Mid-Continent. Should prices further deteriorate, we may elect to curtail, shut-in and/or defer additional natural gas production.
 
The following tables detail Newfields production by area and, in addition, the impact of non-strategic asset sales, as well as planned 2012 investments and production by region.

2012 Planned Capital Investments and Expected Production by Area
Full-Year 2012 Guidance
 
The following table provides production and certain cost guidance for the full year 2012. For the first quarter of 2012, Newfield expects that its production will be approximately 72 Bcfe (comprised of 39 Bcfe of natural gas, 3.2 MMBbls of domestic oil and 2.3 MMBbls of international oil). Early in the first quarter of 2012, Newfield deferred production of approximately 2 Bcfe associated with well shut-ins and deferred completions in the Mid-Continent. Our cost structure per Mcfe during the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be within 5% of the amounts listed below.

Cana Woodford Assessment
 
In 2011, Newfield invested approximately $100 million to build a 125,000 net-acre position in the Cana Woodford, located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. This acreage is a southeast extension of the prolific Cana Woodford play. Newfield plans to invest approximately $300 million in the new area in 2012 and expects to operate up to seven drilling rigs. The Company believes that the acreage lies in both oil and liquids-rich gas areas of the play. Newfield will provide an update on its drilling results around mid-year 2012. Today, Newfield has more than 300,000 net acres in Oklahomas Woodford play.

2012 ESTIMATES
The following table provides production and certain cost guidance for the full year 2012. For the first quarter of 2012, we expect that our production will be approximately 72 Bcfe (comprised of 39 Bcfe of natural gas, 3.2 MMBbls of domestic oil and 2.3 MMBbls of international oil). Early in the first quarter of 2012, we deferred production of approximately 2 Bcfe associated with well shut-ins and deferred completions in the Mid-Continent. Costs for the first quarter of 2012 are expected to be within 5% of the annual ranges listed below.
 
 
Note 1: Production/liftings is subject to timing and can vary by quarter.
