These weighted-average fixed prices for the respective periods represent the resultant hedge position which is a combination of the put spread in our existing 3-way collar contracts, existing fixed price swap contracts and the recently added fixed price swap contracts.

The following table details the expected impact to pre-tax income from the settlement of our derivative contracts, outlined above, at various NYMEX gas prices.
In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 5 Bcf of our natural gas production from January 2012 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted-average price of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
In the Mid-Continent, we also have hedged basis associated with approximately 17 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the Stiles/Britt Ranch area for the period January 2012 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
Approximately 15% of our natural gas production correlates to Houston Ship Channel, 15% to Columbia Gulf, 15% to Texas Gas Zone 1, 3% to Tetco ELA, 7% to CenterPoint/East, 26% to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, 3% to Waha, 7% to Colorado Interstate, and 9% to others.

In August 2011, we entered into a series of transactions that had the effect of unwinding all of our then outstanding crude oil swaps for 2012, effectively eliminating the variability in cash flows associated with the future settlement of those contracts.
