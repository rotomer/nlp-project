Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
On or about November 15, 2011, Newfield Exploration Company (the Company) received a letter from the Central Laborers Pension Fund (the Central Laborers Fund) that included a stockholder proposal to implement a policy at the Company that would separate the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board (the Stockholder Proposal). The Stockholder Proposal was included as Item 4 in the Proxy Statement distributed to stockholders on or about March 23, 2012.  Prior to receiving the Stockholder Proposal, the Companys Board of Directors was in the process of revising its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which included an expanded explanation of the roles and responsibilities of the independent Lead Director.  On February 10, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available for review on the Companys website, , under the heading Corporate Governance.  After communications with the Central Laborers Fund, the Company received a letter dated March 23, 2012 from the Central Laborers Fund withdrawing the Stockholder Proposal. As a result, the Stockholder Proposal will not be presented, and no vote will be required with respect thereto, at the Companys 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 4, 2012.
