In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 4 Bcf of our natural gas production from April 2012 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted-average price of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
In the Mid-Continent, we also have hedged basis associated with approximately 13 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the Stiles/Britt Ranch area for the period April 2012 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
Approximately 12% of our natural gas production correlates to Houston Ship Channel, 16% to Columbia Gulf, 16% to Texas Gas Zone 1, 5% to Tennessee 800, 7% to CenterPoint/East, to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, to Waha, 10% to Colorado Interstate, and 7% to others.
