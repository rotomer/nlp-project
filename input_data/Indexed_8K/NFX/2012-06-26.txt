To the extent that our opinions relate to the enforceability of the choice of New York law or any choice of New York forum provisions of any Subject Document, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2011) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2011) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy, comity and constitutionality. We express no opinion as to whether a United States federal court would have subject-matter or personal jurisdiction over a controversy arising under the Subject Documents.
