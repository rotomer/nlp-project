For the second quarter of 2012, Newfield recorded net income of $135 million, or $1.00 per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Net income for the second quarter includes a net unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $83 million ($53 million after-tax), or $0.39 per share.  Without the effect of this item, net income for the second quarter of 2012 would have been $82 million, or $0.61 per share.
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2012 were $628 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $330 million. See found after the financial statements in this release.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Substantially all of our capital in 2012 is being allocated to oil and liquids projects within our portfolio, said Lee K. Boothby, Chairman, President and CEO. We are driving strong oil and liquids growth  now estimated to increase nearly 30% over 2011 levels.
 
Newfields second quarter 2012 production was 76.4 Bcfe, of which 49% was oil and liquids. Newfields oil and liquids liftings in the second quarter of 2012 increased 40% over the comparable period in 2011 to 6.1 MMBbls, or an average of more than 67,000 BOPD. Natural gas liquids accounted for approximately 4% of second quarter total production. Natural gas production in the second quarter of 2012 was approximately 40 Bcf, an average of about 440 MMcf/d.
 
For the year 2012, Newfield expects its total Company production will range between 296  304 Bcfe and that its capital investments in 2012 will approximate $1.7 billion. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2012 were approximately $400 million.
 
Full-Year 2012 Guidance
 
Newfield raised its 2012 expectations for total Company production to 296  304 Bcfe (previous guidance was 292  302 Bcfe). Our cost structure per Mcfe during 2012 is expected to be within 5% of the amounts listed below.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
 
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
 
A reconciliation of earnings for the second quarter of 2012 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and natural gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:

The Woodlands, Texas  July 19, 2012 
Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
http://www.newfield.com
We have seen solid assessment results year-to-date in our key domestic operating areas, said Lee K. Boothby, Newfield Chairman, President and CEO. Our 2012 plan called for the early and rapid assessment of new plays in the Uintas Central Basin, the Cana Woodford in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and super extended laterals (SXLs) in the Maverick Basin Eagle Ford. We are seeing very encouraging results in each area today and feel confident that the economics of these plays will allow us to move them into aggressive development in 2013 and beyond.
Our shift to oil, which began in 2009, continues as more than half of our expected production in the second half of 2012 will be oil/liquids. For 2012, we expect our oil/liquids production will increase nearly 30% over 2011 levels. Our liquids production today is largely black oil. With the strength of our performance year-to-date, we are again revising our full-year 2012 production expectations higher. Our focus today is clear: grow oil production, grow cash flow and position our Company for strong performance in 2013.
Newfields oil and liquids liftings in the second quarter of 2012 were 6.1 MMBbls (67,000 BOPD) and comprised 49% of total Company production. Approximately 4% of Newfields second quarter production was NGLs. Second quarter 2012 oil/liquids volumes were 40% higher than in the comparable period of 2011. Natural gas production in the second quarter of 2012 was approximately 40 Bcf, or an average of approximately 440 MMcf/d.  On an equivalent basis, Newfields production in the second quarter of 2012 was 76.4 Bcfe.
For the second time this year, Newfield raised its 2012 expectations for total Company production to 296  304 Bcfe (previous guidance was 292  302 Bcfe). With increasing activities planned in key oil regions in late 2012 and ongoing leasing in the Cana Woodford, Newfield expects that its capital investments in 2012 will approximate $1.7 billion, or the upper end of its original guidance range of $1.5  $1.7 billion.

Assessment Plays Benefitting from Controlled Flowback
 
In all of Newfields wet gas condensate and oil assessment plays, the Company is employing controlled flowback in its completion practices. This includes recent horizontal well results disclosed in this news release from the Cana Woodford, Uinta Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Williston Basin. Through this practice, initial production rates are being intentionally held back to minimize pressure drawdown, maintain higher reservoir pressure and maximize oil recovery over time.
 
Cana Woodford
 
In late 2010, Newfield began to aggressively lease acreage in the Cana Woodford play in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. At the time, these leases were south and east of the majority of industry activity. Today, more than 45 industry rigs are running in this play. Newfield now has more than 135,000 net acres in the play, up from 125,000 net acres in early 2012. The Company ran an average of five operated rigs in the first half of 2012 and, with continued strong results, plans to further increase activity levels in 2013.
 
Newfield is very encouraged with its results in the play to date. Todays drilling campaign is focused on the South Cana  an area prone to high oil and liquids yields that encompasses about 80,000 net acres. Recent notable wells from the Companys South Cana drilling program include:
 
Based on available public data, Newfields Wright well (74% working interest) had the highest initial flow rate (all rates are 24-hour) achieved to date in the South Cana Woodford. The well had an initial gross production rate of more than 1,900 BOEPD (27% oil).  The well averaged approximately 1,450 BOEPD over its first 7 days of production. The well has a 4,730 lateral length.
Wright 1H-9
 
The Branch well (100% working interest) had an initial gross production rate of more than 1,850 BOEPD (27% oil). The well averaged approximately 1,550 BOEPD over its first 7 days of production. The well has a 4,950 lateral length.
Branch 1H-16
 
The Whitt well (93% working interest) had an initial gross production rate of approximately 1,050 BOEPD (50% oil). The well averaged nearly 900 BOEPD over its first 7 days of production. The well has a lateral length of 4,900.
Whitt 1H-25
 
The Faith well (52% working interest) had an initial gross production rate of nearly 1,000 BOEPD (22% oil). The well averaged approximately 900 BOEPD over its first 30 days of production. The well has a lateral length of 4,200.
Faith 1H-12
 
The Greenwood well (63% working interest) had an initial gross production rate of 1,000 BOEPD (16% oil).  The well averaged 930 BOEPD over its first 7 days of production. The well has a lateral length of 4,900.
Greenwood 1H-4
 
The Williams well (94% working interest) had an initial gross production rate of approximately 650 BOEPD (69% oil). The well averaged 430 BOEPD over its first 30 days of production. The well has a lateral length of 4,900.
Williams 1H-19
 
The Company also has approximately 55,000 net acres located in the North Cana. This region is in very early stages of assessment, with drilling planned in the second half of 2012.
 
Newfield is a proven operator in the Woodford formation of Oklahoma where it has drilled approximately 380 horizontal wells in the Arkoma Woodford since 2005. In the second half of 2012 and into 2013, Newfield plans to drill SXL wells (up to 10,000 laterals) in the Cana Woodford, a practice that led to improved production rates, higher recoveries of hydrocarbons, lower finding and development costs and improved returns in the Arkoma Woodford.
 
Net production from Newfields Mid-Continent region is approximately 57,000 BOEPD.

Uinta Basin Oil Developments
 
Newfields production from the Uinta Basin continues to grow with current gross production recently setting a new record of approximately 36,000 BOEPD, or 25,000 BOEPD net. Full-year 2012 production is expected to increase about 20% over 2011 levels. Newfield owns interest in approximately 230,000 net acres in the Uinta Basin.
 
The regions production growth is being driven by strong results from the Central Basin region, an area located immediately north and adjacent to Monument Butte. The Central Basin is producing more than 7,500 BOEPD gross (85% oil) from new plays in the Uteland Butte and Wasatch.
 
 Newfield is very encouraged with production rates from its first two horizontal wells completed in the pressured section of the Uteland Butte. Initial production rates from the two pressured wells were nearly three times the rate of the Companys initial wells in the normally-pressured Uteland Butte section.
Uteland Butte
 
The Grace is the most recent well to commence production with initial gross production of 1,476 BOEPD (87% oil), and averaged 1,276 BOEPD over its first 7 days of production.
Grace 3-16
 
The Thorne had initial gross production of 1,435 BOEPD (87% oil), and averaged 929 BOEPD over its first 30 days of production.
Thorne 4-2
 
The Company is currently completing two additional pressured Uteland Butte wells. Newfield has more than 200,000 net acres prospective for the Uteland Butte. In development mode, Newfield believes that these wells will be drilled and completed for about $5.5 million gross.
 
 Since mid-2011, Newfield has drilled and completed more than 30 vertical wells in the pressured Wasatch play, a deeper geologic formation prevalent on approximately 60,000 net acres. Year-to-date 2012, Newfield has completed 18 vertical Wasatch wells with an average initial gross production rate of nearly 900 BOEPD and a 30-day average gross rate of more than 400 BOEPD. On average, the pressured vertical Wasatch wells can be drilled and completed for about $4.2 million gross.
Wasatch
 
The Company recently commenced production on its first two pressured Wasatch wells. Although encouraged with early flowback, the wells continue to clean-up and have not yet achieved peak initial production rates. Peak rates are expected in the next few weeks.
horizontal
 
In the second half of 2012, the Company plans to drill an additional 15-20 pressured wells in the Central Basin, primarily targeting the Uteland Butte and Wasatch formations.
 
 
Eagle Ford
 
Newfield has approximately 230,000 net acres in the Maverick Basin of Texas and has been active in Maverick, Zavala and Dimmit counties since 2010. In early 2012, Newfield commenced a program to test SXLs on its Eagle Ford acreage.
Year-to-date, Newfield has drilled three successful SXL wells with lateral lengths of approximately 7,500 in Dimmit County. The three SXL wells had average initial gross production rates ranging from 750 BOEPD to 1,020 BOEPD gross. Two of the three wells have been on-line for at least 90 days with average production per well of 600 BOEPD gross for the period. Newfield has a 100% working interest in these wells.
Based on production data to date, Newfield estimates the SXL wells have a gross EUR of more than 500 MBOE. Newfield has approximately 40,000 net acres under assessment and development in the Eagle Ford. Six additional SXL wells are planned for the second half of this year, including a 10,000 lateral.
In addition, Newfield is participating in an outside-operated Eagle Ford program in Atascosa County, Texas, where the Company has an average 65% working interest in approximately 8,000 gross acres which are held by production. Two wells have been drilled to date and are in various stages of completion. Additional drilling is planned in the second half of 2012.

Drilling efficiencies are evident in the Companys Eagle Ford operations, with the recent SXLs being drilled and cased in as few as 12 days. Newfield estimates that SXL wells can be drilled and completed for approximately $8 million gross.
Current net production from the Companys Onshore Gulf Coast area is more than 15,000 BOEPD.
 
Williston Basin
 
Newfields net production in the Williston Basin recently achieved a new high of more than 10,000 BOEPD. The increase reflects strong production rates from six second-quarter 2012 well completions. The recent wells had average initial gross production rates of approximately 2,650 BOEPD. Average lateral lengths were more than 11,000.
 
A recent notable completion was the Moberg well (72% working interest), which had initial gross production of approximately 3,500 BOEPD and averaged 1,380 BOEPD over its first 30 days of production. The well was drilled on a two-well pad and had a lateral length of approximately 11,000. The well was drilled and completed for approximately $10 million gross.
Moberg Federal 29-32-2H
 
As drilling has transitioned into development from common pad locations, efficiency gains continue to be realized. Newfield recently drilled a SXL well with a lateral length of 11,500 in 20 days. This compares to a 2010 and 2011 average days-to-depth of 45 days and 35 days, respectively. Over the last two years, increased lateral lengths have helped to lower finding and development costs, increase recoveries of oil in place, improve returns and minimize the surface impact of operations.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, we purposely slowed our activities in the Williston Basin to get a handle on well costs and improve upon our overall execution in the field, said Boothby. Our teams execution in 2012 has been superb and we now have a high rate-of-return development inventory that will drive profitable oil growth over the next several years.
 
The Company is on pace to grow its oil production from the Williston Basin approximately 35% over 2011 levels. Newfield is running three operated rigs in the Williston Basin today where it has approximately 100,000 net acres and an inventory of more than 300 ready-to-drill locations in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Additional resource potential exists in deeper benches within the basin and infill drilling and field studies are currently underway.
 
International Oil Developments
 
Production from Malaysia year-to-date has been above expectations and recently attained a new record of more than 73,000 BOEPD gross, or 30,400 BOEPD net. Full-year oil/liquids liftings are expected to increase more than 40% over 2011 levels.
The East Belumut/Chermingat complex achieved a recent production record of more than 43,000 BOPD (previous high was 40,000 BOPD, first quarter 2012) or 16,500 BOPD net. The increase in production is a result of recent successful development drilling and facility optimization.
 
 
The East Piatu field, which commenced production in early 2012, is today producing 15,000 BOEPD gross (9,000 BOEPD net) and phase II development drilling is underway. The Puteri field is producing approximately 6,000 BOPD gross (2,600 BOPD net).
In addition to the ongoing oil field developments listed above, Newfield recently secured a rig to drill an appraisal well to test a large oil prospect on a 2008 discovery on Deepwater Block 2C (Paus). In addition, the Company will drill an exploration well later this year on Block SK 310. This target is 2.7 miles from Newfields 2010 pinnacle reef gas discovery located on the same license. The Company serves as operator of both blocks with a 40% interest in Block 2C and a 30% interest in SK 310. Results from the wells are expected in late 2012.
 
Fabrication of facilities for the Pearl oil field, located offshore China in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, is ongoing. First production of about 15,000 BOPD net is expected in late 2013 or early 2014.
