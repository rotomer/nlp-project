The Woodlands, Texas  October 23, 2012  Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX)
 
For the third quarter of 2012, Newfield recorded a net loss of $33 million, or ($0.24) per diluted share (all per share amounts are on a diluted basis). Third quarter results were negatively impacted by the following items:
Without the effect of the above items, reported net income for the third quarter of 2012 would have been $65 million, or $0.48 per share.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2012 were $615 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $308 million. See Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures found after the financial statements in this release.
Newfields oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) liftings in the third quarter increased 20% over the comparable period in 2011 to 6.1 MMBbls, or an average of more than 66,000 BOEPD. Natural gas production in the third quarter of 2012 was 39 Bcf, an average of 420 MMcf/d. Combined, Newfields production in the third quarter of 2012 was 75 Bcfe (43% oil and 6% natural gas liquids). Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2012 were approximately $450 million.
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:
Cana Woodford
The Company continues to post strong well results in the Cana Woodford, located in central Oklahomas Anadarko Basin. Throughout 2012, Newfield has maintained a 4-5 rig program and is aggressively assessing its acreage position which totals approximately 142,000 net acres (up 7,000 net acres since mid-year). Net production from Newfields Cana Woodford play is today approximately 9,800 BOEPD (60% liquids).
Production from the following wells, initially announced in the second quarter, has been updated to reflect recent longer-term data:
 
 
 
 
The well had an initial gross production rate of more than 1,900 BOEPD (27% oil). The well averaged approximately 1,050 BOEPD over its first 100 days of production.

Uinta Basin
Newfields net production from the Uinta Basin hit a high in the third quarter of approximately 39,000 BOEPD, or 27,000 BOEPD net. Newfield owns interest in approximately 230,000 net acres in the Uinta Basin. In addition to the ongoing development of the Green River formation in the Monument Butte field, todays assessment drilling efforts are focused on two primary plays  the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch.
 To date, the Company has drilled 11 wells in the play and is encouraged by the results. The Company is operating two rigs in the play today where it has more than 200,000 prospective net acres. Eight of the wells drilled to date are located in the over-pressured Uteland Butte trend. Four wells had average gross initial production of approximately 1,200 BOEPD (87% oil) and an average gross 60-day rate of more than 550 BOEPD.
Uteland Butte
A fifth Uteland Butte well recently commenced production and is now producing 850 BOEPD and continues to clean-up after fracture stimulation. Five additional Uteland Butte wells are awaiting completion and will be on-line in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 Since mid-2011, Newfield has drilled and completed more than 35 vertical wells in the Wasatch, a pressured formation more than 1,200 thick and prevalent on approximately 60,000 net acres. The vertical wells to date have averaged initial gross production of nearly 900 BOEPD. The wells have averaged approximately 400 BOEPD, 275 BOEPD and 250 BOEPD over 30, 60 and 90 days, respectively.
Wasatch
The Company recently drilled and completed its first two horizontal Wasatch wells. The wells were located approximately five miles apart and were oriented in the upper-most prospective interval of the Wasatch. The wells had lateral lengths of approximately 3,200 and average gross initial production of more than 1,200 BOEPD (88% oil). The wells averaged 750 BOEPD and 625 BOEPD over 60 and 90 days, respectively.
Lateral lengths on the Companys horizontal wells drilled to date in the Uinta Basin average approximately 3,500. Newfield is working with Utah state regulatory authorities for approval of a plan to drill longer laterals in the Uinta Basin as part of its overall development. In all resource plays where Newfield is active, longer laterals (up to 10,000) have proven advantageous to reducing surface footprint, maximizing ultimate recoveries and improving overall returns.
Before year-end, the Company plans to drill six additional horizontal pressured wells in the Central Basin, targeting the Uteland Butte and Wasatch formations.
Williston Basin
Newfields net production in the Williston Basin achieved a recent high of more than 10,500 BOEPD. To date, the Company has completed 71 wells in the basin, of which 35 are super extended laterals (SXLs). The table below details all Newfield-operated Williston Basin wells drilled from 2010 through today:

Newfields focus in 2012 has been on improving execution at the field level. Year-to-date, Newfield has averaged about 25 days from spud to rig release in its Williston Basin program. During the third quarter, a best-in-class well was drilled and cased in 18 days. Completed well costs continue to reflect efficiency gains and the Company estimates that its 2013 wells can be drilled and completed for about $10 million gross.
 
Production from the Williston Basin is expected to increase more than 35% over 2011 levels. Three operated rigs are running today and a fourth rig will be added in early 2013. The Company has approximately 100,000 net acres in the Williston Basin and an expected inventory of more than 300 locations in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. During the quarter, Newfield initiated a detailed study taking cores through the Bakken and the multiple benches prevalent at deeper intervals. The data will be used to plan a future program to exploit the prospective Three Forks/Sanish formation.
Eagle Ford
Newfield has approximately 230,000 net acres in the Maverick Basin of Texas and has been active in Maverick, Zavala and Dimmit counties since 2010. In early 2012, Newfield commenced a program to test SXLs on its Eagle Ford acreage. Year-to-date, Newfield has drilled and completed four successful SXL wells with lateral lengths of approximately 7,500 in Dimmit County. Newfield has a 100% working interest in all of the SXL wells drilled to date. Recent SXLs are being drilled and cased in as few as 12 days.
The four SXL wells had average initial gross production rates ranging from 750 BOEPD to 1,020 BOEPD gross (approximately 75% oil). Two of the wells have now been on-line for more than 180 days and have averaged 530 BOEPD gross. A third well has been on-line for 120 days, averaging approximately 800 BOEPD gross. Most recently, a fourth SXL well was completed and turned to sales. Over a 10-day period, the well has averaged 730 BOEPD gross. Newfield is currently completing its first 10,000 lateral in Dimmit County. 
Based on production data to date, Newfield estimates its SXL wells have a gross EUR of more than 500 MBOE.
In Atascosa County, Texas, the Company has an average 65% working interest in approximately 8,000 gross operated and outside-operated acres, which are held by production. An active drilling campaign is underway. The first well recently commenced production with an initial gross production rate of 615 BOEPD and average gross production of 483 BOEPD over 60 days. An additional six wells are expected to be online in early 2013.
International
Newfields net production from its international operations is today approximately 36,000 BOEPD. The Companys production from offshore Malaysia has performed above expectations year-to-date and recently attained a new record of more than 78,000 BOEPD gross. Full-year oil/liquids liftings from international operations are expected to increase about 50% over 2011 levels.

Earlier this year, Newfield accelerated its planned development drilling at the East Piatu field and today is producing a record 23,000 BOEPD gross (13,000 BOEPD net). The field achieved pay-out over its first nine months of production. Additional drilling opportunities remain.
The East Belumut complex averaged 36,000 BOEPD gross and 14,000 BOEPD net during the third quarter. The Puteri field is producing approximately 6,000 BOPD gross (2,600 BOPD net).
Newfield is currently drilling the second and third wells of a planned three-well exploration program. Results are expected in early 2013.
In China, fabrication of offshore production facilities for the Companys Pearl oil development, located in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, is on schedule for first sales in early 2014. The field is expected to produce approximately 15,000 BOPD net.
Full-Year 2012 Guidance
 
As previously announced, Newfield expects 2012 total Company production to be approximately 298 Bcfe. Our cost structure per Mcfe during 2012 is expected to be within 5% of the amounts listed below.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Newfield discloses earnings without the effect of certain items because it affects the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition, earnings without the effect of certain items is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
A reconciliation of earnings for the third quarter of 2012 stated without the effect of certain items to net income is shown below:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Before Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production companys ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is shown below:
