The following table details the expected impact to pre-tax income from the settlement of our derivative contracts, outlined above, at various NYMEX gas prices.
In the Rocky Mountains, we hedged basis associated with approximately 1 Bcf of our natural gas production from October 2012 through December 2012 to lock in the differential at a weighted average of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.  In total, this hedge and the 8,000 MMBtu per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of $0.91 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
In the Mid-Continent, we have hedged basis associated with approximately 4 Bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the Stiles/Britt Ranch area for the period October 2012 through December 2012 at an average of $0.55 per MMBtu less than the Henry Hub Index.
Approximately of our natural gas production correlates to Houston Ship Channel, 15% to Columbia Gulf, 15% to Texas Gas Zone 1, 7% to CenterPoint/East, to Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, to Waha, 13% to Colorado Interstate, and to others.
