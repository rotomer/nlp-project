EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ________ N E W S NiSource Logo ________ 801 E. 86th Avenue Merrillville, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- October 28, 2002 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -------------------------- MEDIA INVESTORS ----- --------- Kris Falzone Dennis Senchak Director, Corporate Affairs Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-5581 (219) 647-6085 Bill O'Malley Director, Investor Relations (219) 647-5688 Rae Kozlowski Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-6083 NISOURCE REPORTS HIGHER EARNINGS -------------------------------- CONTINUED FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET, DEBT REDUCTION AND EXPENSE CONTROL MERRILLVILLE, IND. -- NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) today reported net income for the third quarter of 2002 of $23.2 million, or 11 cents per share (all per share amounts are basic), versus a net loss of $21.0 million, or a loss of 10 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2001. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2002, NiSource reported net income of $290.4 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to $149.3 million, or 73 cents per share, for the same period in 2001. The third-quarter results are indicative of NiSource's quarterly earnings pattern, with the bulk of the full-year's earnings concentrated in the first and fourth quarters due to the seasonal nature of NiSource's core natural gas operations. "Our third-quarter financial results are consistent with achieving our 2002 plans and our focus on our regulated, asset-based businesses," stated Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We achieved a settlement in the Indiana electric rate investigation, continued our focus on expense control, and announced we are seeking a buyer for our exploration and production (E&P) assets to complement our planned fourth-quarter equity offering. "Balancing our credit rating requirements with our shareholders' expectations also remains a key priority," Neale added. "As a result of our ongoing efforts, the company expects to meet current analysts' consensus estimates for full-year 2002 earnings of $1.90 per share, excluding any impact of the sale of our E&P assets. The full-year earnings include approximately $29 million of net income for NiSource's E&P operations. This forecast also assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, our planned equity offering, and includes the expense of our reorganization initiatives that will be reflected in the fourth quarter." NiSource's third-quarter results were favorably affected by warmer weather during the period when compared to the third quarter of 2001, increasing pre-tax earnings by approximately $9.8 million, or 3 cents per share, mainly due to increased electric sales. As a result of debt reduction efforts and lower short-term interest rates during 2002, the company realized improvements in interest expense of $6.2 million, or 2 cents per share, for the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago. Third-quarter results also included lower operation and maintenance expenses of $56.5 million and the elimination of $23.4 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning Jan. 1, 2002. These favorable factors were partially offset by credits to be issued to customers as a result of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement that was approved by the IURC on Sept. 23, 2002. For the first nine months of 2002, NiSource's results reflected a reduction of $106.8 million in operation and maintenance expenses compared to the same period last year, and improvements in interest expense of $66.9 million, or 20 cents per share. The nine-month results also included the elimination of $69.0 million of goodwill amortization. Through September, the effects of weather in 2002 versus 2001 reduced pre-tax income by $17.6 million, or 5 cents per share, overall, decreasing pre-tax income by $32.2 million during the heating season and increasing pre-tax income by $14.6 million during the cooling season. Also reducing pre-tax income for the nine-month period were credits to be issued to customers as a result of the IURC electric rate review settlement. Through the third quarter, NiSource has paid down approximately $850 million of debt during 2002, after meeting working capital needs for gas storage purchases for the winter heating season and capital expenditures for seasonal construction projects as part of the normal business cycle. The company's balance sheet at Sept. 30 is not comparable to the previous year due to the inclusion of $565 million of assets and related debt for four projects involving subsidiary Primary Energy, Inc., which were treated as off-balance-sheet leases prior to the second quarter of 2002. Effective July 1, 2002, NiSource completed the sale of a substantial portion of its gas marketing portfolio. As a result of the sale, the company's limited gas marketing operations primarily include natural gas sales to commercial and industrial customers. NiSource Inc. is a Fortune 500 holding company with headquarters in Merrillville, Ind., whose core operating companies engage in natural gas transmission, storage and distribution, as well as electric generation, transmission and distribution. NiSource operating companies deliver energy to 3.7 million customers located within the high-demand energy corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest to New England.

THIRD-QUARTER OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT ----------------------------------------- NiSource's third-quarter operating income was $183.3 million compared with $141.0 million from the same period in 2001. GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported a third-quarter operating loss of $20.2 million, compared to a $32.0 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2001. The favorable $11.8 million increase is attributable to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill, insurance recoveries of environmental expenses and decreased corporate overhead. These factors were partially offset by the timing of depreciation and property tax expenses, increased expenses related to NiSource's reorganization initiatives and slightly lower net revenues from reduced gas sales. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $86.1 million, an increase of $31.3 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the effects of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill, lower corporate overhead and a reduction in estimated environmental expenditures. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $99.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million from the comparable period last year, primarily resulting from the favorable effect of warmer weather during the third quarter of 2002 and reductions in estimated amounts payable for property taxes and expenses related to reorganization initiatives. These amounts were mostly offset by lower revenues due to credits to be issued pertaining to the settlement of the IURC electric rate investigation and related expenses. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION operations reported operating income of $1.7 million, a decrease of $18.2 million from the third quarter of 2001. The decrease resulted mainly from lower pricing related to deliveries of natural gas production under forward sales agreements, slightly offset by increased production. The 2001 results have been adjusted to reflect the change to Successful Efforts accounting in the company's Exploration and Production segment. MERCHANT operations reported operating income of $16.6 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the comparable 2001 period. The increase was primarily due to a gain of $3.1 million from the July 1, 2002 sale of a significant portion of EnergyUSA-TPC gas marketing contracts. The 2002 results reflect trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 results have been adjusted to conform to the 2002 presentation. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $0.9 million, versus an operating loss of $4.3 million in 2001. The increase of $3.4 million was largely due to a reduction in estimated sales taxes related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses for certain non- core subsidiaries. OTHER ITEMS ----------- Interest expense was $139.9 million for the quarter compared to $146.1 million for the third quarter of last year, a decrease of $6.2 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates. Other income, net, improved income by $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2002 versus a net loss of $4.7 million in the comparable 2001 period. Income taxes for the third quarter of 2002 were $14.2 million, a $10.4 million increase from 2001, due to higher pre-tax income in the current period. NINE-MONTH PERIOD OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT --------------------------------------------- Operating income was $863.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, compared with $750.7 million for the same period in 2001. GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported operating income of $264.3 million for the nine-month period, an increase of $7.2 million from the same period in 2001. Reduced operating expenses resulting from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill, insurance recoveries of environmental expenses and lower amounts for uncollectible customer receivables were mostly offset by the unfavorable impact of overall warmer weather during the 2002 heating season, lower net revenues from non-traditional sales and incentive programs and increased expenses related to NiSource's reorganization initiatives. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $289.5 million, an increase of $45.8 million from the 2001 period, reflecting the effects of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill, a reduction in estimated environmental expenditures, and reduced corporate overhead. These amounts were partly offset by the impact of a gain on the sale of base gas that occurred in the 2001 period. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $239.9 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from last year resulting from lower revenue due to credits to be issued pertaining to the settlement of the IURC electric rate investigation and increased amounts for uncollectible customer receivables, partially offset by the favorable impact of warmer weather during the cooling season. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION operations reported operating income of $40.3 million, an increase of $1.1 million from the first nine months of 2001, reflecting increased production and a reduction in estimated expenses from reorganization initiatives, mostly offset by the effects of lower pricing related to deliveries of natural gas production under forward sales agreements. The 2001 results have been adjusted to reflect the change to Successful Efforts accounting in the company's Exploration and Production segment. MERCHANT operations reported operating income of $3.5 million, a decrease of $30.5 million from the 2001 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to depreciation and operating expenses associated with the company's two recently completed cogeneration projects; accounts receivable actualization and reconciliation adjustments; employee-related expenses; decreased electric wheeling revenues due to the expiration of certain contracts and the change in value of the company's gas and power marketing portfolios. These amounts were partly offset by the $3.1 million gain on the sale of a substantial portion of EnergyUSA-TPC gas marketing contracts. The 2002 results reflect trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2001 results have been adjusted to conform to the 2002 presentation. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $2.1 million, versus an operating loss of $49.4 million in 2001, reflecting the $15.5 million 2001 litigation settlement of Market Hub Partners, L.P., a reduction in estimated sales taxes related to sales of natural gas to retail and wholesale customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business and reduced losses related to the company's telecommunications network and other non-core subsidiaries. OTHER ITEMS ----------- Interest expense was $391.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002, compared to $458.7 million for the first nine months of last year, a decrease of $66.9 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates. Other income, net, improved income by $7.2 million in the first nine months of 2002 versus a net loss of $0.5 million in the comparable 2001 period. Income taxes for the first nine months of 2002 were $172.2 million, a $48.4 million increase from 2001, due to higher pre-tax income in the current period.
