(NYSE:NI) today announced that it is offering 30 million shares of new common stock in an underwritten offering commencing tomorrow that would amount to approximately $500 million in gross proceeds. The net proceeds from the offering will be used for the repayment of debt. NiSource also today announced that it expects 2003 net income to increase by 5 percent, generating earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share. NiSource's earnings per share guidance reflects an increase in the company's number of shares outstanding, including the shares to be issued in the offering, as well as the anticipated conversion of its Premium Income Equity Securities (PIES) into approximately 13.1 million shares of common stock in February 2003. The guidance also takes into account the impact of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement and higher expected pension and insurance expenses. NiSource's earnings outlook assumes normal weather. "In 2003, we will continue to focus on what we do best: optimizing revenue opportunities and managing expenses in our regulated, asset- based businesses," stated Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "As a result of these factors, 2003 will produce a stronger balance sheet, solid earnings and stable dividend. NiSource will continue to deliver an attractive return to our shareholders." -more- NISOURCE ANNOUNCES EQUITY OFFERING AND 2003 EARNINGS OUTLOOK PAGE 2 In connection with the offering, the company will grant the underwriters an option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 4.5 million shares of the company's common stock to cover over-allotments.
