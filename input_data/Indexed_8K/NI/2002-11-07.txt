PURCHASE AND OFFERING OF OFFERED SECURITIES. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be evidenced by an agreement or exchange of other written communications ("TERMS AGREEMENT") at the time NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, determines to sell the Offered Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate by reference the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the names of the Representatives, the principal amount or number of shares to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters and (if the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock) the terms of the Offered Securities not already specified (in the Indenture, in the case of Offered Securities that are debt securities), including, but not limited to, interest rate (if debt securities), dividend rate (if preferred stock), maturity (if debt securities), any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements and whether any of the Offered Securities may be sold to institutional investors pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined below). The Terms Agreement will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Underwriter first named in the Terms Agreement (the "LEAD UNDERWRITER") and NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "CLOSING DATE"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Offered Securities. For purposes of Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Closing Date (if later than the otherwise applicable settlement date) shall be the date for payment of funds and delivery of securities for all the Offered Securities sold pursuant to the offering, other than Contract Securities (as defined below) for which payment of funds and delivery of securities shall be as hereinafter provided. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Offered Securities for sale as set forth in the Prospectus. If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto ("DELAYED DELIVERY CONTRACTS") with such changes therein as NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date NiSource and/or NiSource Finance will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to 9 be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts ("CONTRACT SECURITIES"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If NiSource and/or NiSource Finance execute and deliver Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Securities will be deducted from the Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Lead Underwriter determines that such reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and so advises NiSource and/or NiSource Finance. NiSource and/or NiSource Finance will advise the Lead Underwriter not later than the business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount or number of shares of Contract Securities. If the Offered Securities are preferred stock or Common Stock, the certificates for the Offered Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive form, and if the Offered Securities are debt securities, the Offered Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive fully registered form, in each case in such denominations and registered in such names as the Lead Underwriter requests. If the Offered Securities are debt securities and the Terms Agreement specifies "Book-Entry Only" settlement or otherwise states that the provisions of this paragraph shall apply, NiSource Finance will deliver against payment of the purchase price the Offered Securities in the form of one or more permanent global securities in definitive form (the "GLOBAL SECURITIES") deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Interests in any permanent global securities will be held only in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in the Prospectus. Payment for the Offered Securities shall be made by the Underwriters in Federal (same day) funds by official check or checks or wire transfer to an account previously designated by NiSource Finance at a bank acceptable to the Lead Underwriter, in each case drawn to the order of NiSource Finance at the place of payment specified in the Terms Agreement on the Closing Date, against delivery to the Trustee as custodian for DTC of the Global Securities representing all of the Offered Securities. 4. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF NISOURCE AND NISOURCE FINANCE. Each of NiSource and NiSource Finance agrees with the several Underwriters that it will furnish to counsel for the Underwriters, one copy of the executed registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, including all exhibits, in the form it became effective and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with each offering of Offered Securities: 10 (a) NiSource and NiSource Finance will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b)(2) (or, if applicable and if consented to by the Lead Underwriter, subparagraph (5)) not later than the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement. (b) NiSource and NiSource Finance will advise the Lead Underwriter promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and will afford the Lead Underwriter a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and NiSource and NiSource Finance will also advise the Lead Underwriter promptly of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued. (c) NiSource will comply with the provisions of the Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations so as to permit completion of the distribution of the Offered Securities as contemplated by the applicable Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, NiSource and NiSource Finance promptly will notify the Lead Underwriter of such event and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at the expense of NiSource and NiSource Finance, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither the Lead Underwriter's consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof. (d) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months, after the date of each Terms Agreement, NiSource will make generally available to its securityholders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the later of (i) the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such Terms Agreement and (iii) the date of NiSource's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such Terms 11 Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act. (e) NiSource or NiSource Finance will furnish to the Representatives copies of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits, any related preliminary prospectus, any related preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Lead Underwriter reasonably requests. NiSource or NiSource Finance will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Underwriters all such documents. (f) NiSource or NiSource Finance will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Lead Underwriter designates and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution, provided that, in connection with such qualification, neither NiSource nor NiSource Finance shall be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. (g) During the period of five years after the date of any Terms Agreement, NiSource will furnish to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to stockholders for such year; and NiSource will furnish to the Representative (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report and any definitive proxy statement of NiSource filed with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or mailed to stockholders, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning NiSource or NiSource Finance as the Lead Underwriter may reasonably request. (h) Each of NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any filing fees or other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with qualification of the Registered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Lead Underwriter may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities (if they are debt securities or preferred stock), any applicable filing fee incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the Registered Securities, and any travel expenses of its officers and employees and any other expenses incurred by it in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of Registered Securities. 12 (i) If the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock, neither NiSource nor NiSource Finance will offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued by NiSource Finance and guaranteed by NiSource and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue (if the Offered Securities are debt securities) or any series of preferred stock issued by NiSource (if the Offered Securities are preferred stock), or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representatives for a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the number of days after the Closing Date specified under "Blackout" in the Terms Agreement. (j) If the Offered Securities are Common Stock or are convertible into Common Stock, NiSource will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to, any additional shares of its Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its Common Stock, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representatives for a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the number of days after the Closing Date specified under "Blackout" in the Terms Agreement, except issuances of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities or the exercise of warrants or options, in each case outstanding on the date of the Terms Agreement, grants of employee stock options pursuant to the terms of a plan in effect on the date of the Terms Agreement, or issuances of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of such options. 5.

(ii) they have performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited financial statements for the applicable three-month and six-month periods ended March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002 included in the Registration Statement; (iii) on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of NiSource, inquiries of officials of NiSource who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (A) the unaudited financial statements, if any, and any summary of earnings relating thereto and included in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conform it with generally accepted accounting principles; (B) if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Prospectus, the unaudited consolidated operating revenues, gross income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income; (C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of NiSource and its consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest 14 available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any decrease in consolidated net current assets or net assets, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Prospectus; except in all cases set forth in this clause (C) for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; or (D) for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year and with the period of corresponding length ended the date of the latest income statement included in the Prospectus, in consolidated operating revenues, operating income or net income; except in all cases set forth in this clause (D) for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; (iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of NiSource subject to the internal controls of the accounting system of NiSource or are derived from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter. All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Prospectus for purposes of this subsection. (b) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in accordance with the Rules and Regulations and Section 4(a) of this Agreement.

(xiv) The execution and delivery by each of NiSource and NiSource Finance of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) do not, and the performance by each of NiSource and NiSource Finance of its respective obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities, will not, (i) violate the certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws of NiSource or NiSource Finance, (ii) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to NiSource or NiSource Finance and generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) undertaken by issuers engaged 20 in businesses similar to the businesses of NiSource and NiSource Finance, (iii) violate any judgment, injunction, order or decree identified by an officer of NiSource or NiSource Finance as material to NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole (which judgments, injunctions, orders and decrees, if any, shall be set forth in a certificate attached to the opinion), or (iv) breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, instrument or agreement which is filed as an exhibit to or filed as an exhibit through incorporation by reference to either NiSource's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended on the December 31 preceding the date of delivery of such opinion or any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Report on Form 8-K filed subsequent to the date of such Form 10-K; (xv) The descriptions in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus of any statutes, legal and governmental proceedings, contracts and documents, insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of law and legal conclusions with respect thereto, are correct in all material respects; and such counsel do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending to which NiSource, NiSource Finance or any Subsidiary is a party or to which any of their respective properties is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so described, or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not so described or filed as required;

such counsel have had no facts come to their attention that have led them to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as supplemented as of 21 the date of the prospectus supplement or as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and (xvii) The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and, if the Offered Securities are debt securities issued by NiSource Finance and guaranteed by NiSource or preferred stock, the Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be.

In rendering such opinion, Dewey Ballantine LLP may rely as to the incorporation of NiSource Finance and all other matters governed by Indiana law upon the opinion of Schiff Hardin & Waite referred to above.

Each of NiSource and NiSource Finance agrees to furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request. The Lead Underwriter may in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement. 6. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) NiSource and NiSource Finance, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any 23 material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that NiSource and NiSource Finance will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to NiSource or NiSource Finance by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement; AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus or prospectus supplement the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Offered Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to such Offered Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person, a copy of the prospectus or prospectus supplement (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) if NiSource or NiSource Finance had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless NiSource and NiSource Finance, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls each of NiSource and NiSource Finance within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which NiSource or NiSource Finance may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in 24 conformity with written information furnished to NiSource or NiSource Finance by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by NiSource or NiSource Finance in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource 25 Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by NiSource and NiSource Finance bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of NiSource and NiSource Finance under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which NiSource or NiSource Finance may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of NiSource and NiSource Finance, to each officer of NiSource and NiSource Finance who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls NiSource or NiSource Finance within the meaning of the Act. 26 7. DEFAULT OF UNDERWRITERS. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or NiSource or NiSource Finance, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. If the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock, the respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts (if debt securities) or numbers of shares (if preferred stock) of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be. 8. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of NiSource, NiSource Finance or their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, NiSource, NiSource Finance or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, NiSource and NiSource Finance shall remain 27 responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.
