EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ PRESS RELEASE ------------- NEWS [NiSource Logo] 801 E. 86th Avenue Merrillville, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 29, 2003 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -------------------------- Media Investors ----- --------- Mark Friedlander Dennis Senchak Corporate Spokesperson Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-6217 (219) 647-6085 mfriedland@nisource.com senchak@nisource.com ----------------------- -------------------- Randy Hulen Director, Investor Relations (219) 647-5688 rghulen@nisource.com -------------------- Rae Kozlowski Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-6083 ekozlowski@nisource.com ----------------------- NiSource reports higher net income in first quarter 2003 Company continues focus on debt reduction and strengthening balance sheet MERRILLVILLE, Ind. - NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported income from continuing operations of $266.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003 vs. $243.8 million for the same period in 2002, a 9.1 percent increase. First quarter 2003 earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.05 (all share amounts are basic) compared to $1.19 for the first quarter of 2002. Net income for the first quarter of 2003 was $254.9 million, or $1.00 per share, vs. $242.2 million, or $1.18 per share, for the comparable 2002 period. The per share results were diluted by 23 cents with the issuance of 54.5 million shares of common stock, due to the company's successful equity offering in the fourth quarter of 2002 (41.4 million shares) and the settlement of forward equity agreements under NiSource's Premium Income Equity Securities (PIES) in the first quarter of 2003 (13.1 million shares). "Our continuing actions to streamline our operations, while meeting customer needs during the cold weather, positively contributed to cash flow from operations and strengthened our financial position," said Gary L. Neale, chairman, president and chief executive officer of NiSource Inc. "Taking into consideration cost trackers that are directly offset in revenue, as well as reserve changes, which together increased our 2003 O & M by $22.3 million and decreased our 2002 O & M by $18.8 million, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our baseline O & M expenses are essentially flat," Neale added. "Our streamlining efforts during 2002 largely offset increases in pension and insurance expenses during this period. Even with the sustained cold weather, our operating companies continued to meet the strong demand for energy required by our customers. "Because of our enhanced liquidity, we no longer required a $500 million, 364-day credit facility. In fact, we reached a milestone on Feb. 20 when our short-term debt hit zero for the first time since our acquisition of Columbia Energy Group in November 2000. During the remainder of 2003, short-term borrowings will be used for working capital-primarily funding storage and receivables. "Since December of 2000, we have reduced overall debt by approximately $2 billion through the sale of non-strategic assets and the issuance of common stock." Factors that affected first quarter 2003 performance * The effects of colder weather resulted in a favorable impact on pre-tax operating income of $59.7 million, or 15 cents per share after tax, compared to the first quarter of 2002. The favorable impact is net of lower interruptible transmission service revenues and higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of peak sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas and slightly higher uncollectible receivables at the distribution subsidiaries. * Operating income in the exploration and production segment increased $38.5 million vs. the comparable 2002 period, reflecting a pre-tax gain of $70.8 million from the sale of the company's interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York state, offset by $26.1 million as a result of lower average prices related to deliveries of natural gas production under forward gas sales agreements. * An after-tax reduction to net income of $8.8 million, or 4 cents per share, from the cumulative effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 143 on asset retirement obligations. * An unfavorable impact to operating income of $22.9 million, or 6 cents per share after tax, which included a charge of $13.5 million for credits issued to Northern Indiana Public Service Company customers as a result of the 2002 Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission electric rate review settlement, and an increase in pension expense of $9.4 million. * For comparison purposes, first quarter 2002 results were favorably impacted by $42.7 million, or 13 cents per share after tax, from the sales of assets, mainly NiSource's utility line- locating business, insurance recoveries of environmental expenses and the reversal of reserves.

GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported operating income of $314.2 million, an increase of $64.6 million from the same period in 2002. The increase was mainly attributable to increased sales and deliveries of natural gas due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003 net of increased uncollectible receivables from the effects of weather-driven higher gas costs on the residential customer base, and increased pension expense. The 2002 period was positively impacted by insurance recoveries of environmental expenses. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $111.3 million, a decrease of $15.5 million from the year-ago period, reflecting lower interruptible transmission service revenues and higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $52.6 million, a decrease of $19.2 million from the comparable period last year, primarily resulting from lower revenues due to credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and increased pension expense. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION operations reported operating income of $71.2 million, an increase of $38.5 million from the first quarter 2002. The increase resulted mainly from the gain on the sale of NiSource's interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in New York state. The gain was partly offset by lower average prices related to deliveries of natural gas production under forward sales agreements and decreased production. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $7.0 million, vs. operating income of $16.0 million in 2002. The 2003 period was affected by lower margins on the power trading and gas marketing portfolios, and increased depreciation expense primarily related to a cogeneration facility placed in service during 2002. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of gas marketing contracts and the reversal of related reserves. The 2003 results reflect trading activities on a net revenue basis. The 2002 results have been adjusted to conform to the 2003 presentation. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $126.0 million for the quarter compared to $128.0 million for the first quarter of last year, a decrease of $2.0 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt partially offset by interest expense from long-term debt associated with a cogeneration facility placed in service during 2002. Income taxes for the first quarter of 2003 were $157.0 million, a $12.1 million increase from 2002, due to higher pre-tax income in the current period.
