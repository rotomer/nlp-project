(NYSE:NI) Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Gary L. Neale today expressed disappointment with the decision by Moody's Investors Service to review NiSource's credit rating for possible downgrade, but stated that he remained confident NiSource would be able to demonstrate to Moody's that the company's continuing actions to reduce debt warrant an investment grade rating. Neale added that NiSource has very strong cash flow and current liquidity of approximately $775 million. In the event a downgrade were to happen, collateral calls resulting from ratings triggers would be limited to $275 million and no default would be created under any of NiSource's loan agreements. Neale went on to say, "NiSource has been working with Moody's, reviewing different options to reduce debt leverage. The company has reduced its debt by almost $2 billion over the last 15 months and also reduced its business risk profile by selling non-core, unregulated assets and has, for example, exited the gas trading business." Neale added that NiSource compares favorably to its peers in many respects and therefore, deserves an investment grade credit rating. - MORE -
