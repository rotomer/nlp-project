EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ PRESS RELEASE ------------- NEWS [NISOURCE LOGO] 801 E. 86th Avenue Merrillville, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 30, 2003 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -------------------------- MEDIA INVESTORS ----- --------- Kris Falzone Dennis Senchak Director, Corporate Affairs Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-5581 (219) 647-6085 klfalzone@nisource.com senchak@nisource.com ----------------------- -------------------- Randy Hulen Director, Investor Relations (219) 647-5688 rghulen@nisource.com -------------------- Rae Kozlowski Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-6083 ekozlowski@nisource.com ----------------------- NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION, COGENERATION ASSETS REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MERRILLVILLE, IND. - Cost containment efforts and lower interest expense contributed to higher income from continuing operations for NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) during the second quarter of 2003. NiSource today reported income from continuing operations of $39.3 million, or 15 cents per share (all per share amounts are basic), for the three months ended June 30, 2003, compared with $20.8 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period in 2002. During the 2003 period NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations, resulting in a net loss for the three months ended June 30 of $324.9 million, or a loss of $1.24 per share, versus net income of $25.0 million, or 12 cents per share, for the comparable 2002 period. Income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2003, was $261.6 million, or $1.02 per share, compared with $240.4 million, or $1.17 per share, for the same period in 2002. During the 2003 period NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations, resulting in a net loss for the six months ended June 30 of $70.0 million, or a loss of 27 cents per share, versus net income of $267.2 million, or $1.30 per share, for the comparable 2002 period. NiSource issued a total of 54.5 million shares of common stock in November 2002 and February 2003. If those additional shares had been outstanding on Jan. 1, 2002, the per-share results would have been reduced by 2 cents for the second quarter of 2002, and by 26 cents for the first six months of 2002. "The efforts of our management team and all employees to contain costs largely offset the effect of increased pension and insurance expenses," said Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our recent decision to trim our common stock dividend, the sale of non-core assets, the November 2002 equity offering and ongoing debt reduction efforts were influential in the rating agencies' removal of the negative outlook on NiSource's ratings and affirmation of our investment grade credit ratings. Our actions also will enhance our cash flow and provide additional funds to reinvest in NiSource's core businesses for the future," Neale said. "Moving forward, our strategy is to focus on optimizing the potential of our utility and pipeline assets to deliver long-term value to shareholders." FACTORS THAT AFFECTED SECOND-QUARTER 2003 PERFORMANCE ----------------------------------------------------- * A reduction in employee-related and administrative expenses of $20.2 million pre-tax, or 5 cents per share after tax, which was a result of reorganization initiatives during 2002. * As a result of continued debt reduction efforts and lower short- term interest rates, interest expense was reduced by $7.3 million, or 2 cents per share after tax, compared to the second quarter of 2002. * The overall effects of weather resulted in a negative impact on operating income of $10.1 million, or 2 cents per share after tax, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2002. * An unfavorable impact to operating income of $10.8 million, or 3 cents per share after tax, for credits issued to Northern Indiana Public Service Company customers as a result of the 2002 Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) electric rate review settlement. * The effects of increased pension expense reduced operating income by $9.4 million, or 2 cents per share after tax. * In early July, NiSource announced that it signed agreements to sell its exploration and production subsidiary, Columbia Energy Resources, Inc. (CER), and all the steel industry-related, inside-the-fence assets of its subsidiary Primary Energy, Inc. NiSource accounted for CER and the Primary Energy subsidiaries as discontinued operations as of June 30, 2003, and adjusted all periods presented accordingly. During the second quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized an after-tax loss of $362.8 million, or a loss of $1.39 per share, related to the sales. * For comparison purposes, operating income for the quarter ended June 30, 2002, was negatively affected by $17.7 million, or 4 cents per share after tax, for expenses associated with the July 1, 2002, sale of a portfolio of EnergyUSA-TPC gas marketing contracts and the recognition of a reserve related to a long-term note receivable. SECOND QUARTER 2003 OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT NiSource's second quarter 2003 operating income was $175.8 million compared with $158.7 million from the same period in 2002. GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported operating income of $56.8 million, an increase of $21.9 million from the same period in 2002. The increase was mainly attributable to a reduction in employee- related and administrative expenses as a result of the 2002 reorganization initiatives, partly offset by increased pension costs and warmer weather during the quarter. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $87.3 million, an increase of $10.7 million from the comparable 2002 period. The increase was mainly attributable to a reduction in employee-related and administrative expenses and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003, slightly offset by lower revenues in the current period. The 2002 period was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a reserve related to a long-term note receivable. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $64.1 million, a decrease of $16.9 million from the comparable period last year, primarily resulting from lower revenues due to $10.8 million of credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement and cooler weather in the month of June affecting electric sales. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $10.4 million, versus an operating loss of $38.3 million in 2002. The decrease in the operating loss was mainly attributable to a reduction in operation and maintenance expenses as a result of exiting the gas trading business and lower lease expense as a result of the recharacterization of the Whiting Clean Energy operating lease to an asset owned in substance. The 2002 period was negatively impacted by expenses associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of EnergyUSA-TPC gas marketing contracts. CORPORATE operating loss was $22.0 million, versus operating income of $4.5 million in the 2002 period. The decrease was primarily due to increased administrative expenses resulting from reduced allocations to the operating companies and inter-company mark-to-market transactions. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $114.9 million for the quarter compared to $122.2 million for the second quarter of last year, a decrease of $7.3 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by interest expense from long-term debt associated with Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed in service during 2002. Income taxes for the second quarter of 2003 were $26.4 million, a $16.3 million increase from 2002, due to higher pre-tax income in the 2003 period. SIX-MONTH PERIOD OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT Operating income was $648.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, compared with $640.1 million for the same period in 2002. GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported operating income of $371.0 million, an increase of $86.5 million from the same period in 2002. The increase was mainly attributable to increased sales and deliveries of natural gas due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, net of increased uncollectible receivables resulting from a change in the method of calculation and the effects of weather-driven higher gas costs on the residential customer base and a reduction in employee- related and administrative expenses. The 2002 period was positively impacted by insurance recoveries of environmental expenses. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $198.6 million, a decrease of $4.8 million from the comparable 2002 period, reflecting lower interruptible transmission service revenues and higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas, slightly offset by a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a reserve related to a long-term note receivable. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $116.7 million, a decrease of $36.1 million from the comparable period last year, primarily resulting from lower revenues due to $24.3 million of credits issued pertaining to the IURC electric rate review settlement, increased pension expense and cooler weather in the month of June. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $24.3 million, versus an operating loss of $29.4 million in 2002. The decrease in the operating loss was mainly attributable to a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses as a result of exiting the gas trading business. CORPORATE operating loss was $13.8 million, versus operating income of $28.8 million in the 2002 period. The decrease was primarily due to increased administrative expenses resulting from reduced allocations to the operating companies and inter-company mark-to-market transactions. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of NiSource's SM&P utility line-locating business in 2002. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $237.9 million for the first six months of 2003 compared to $249.3 million for the first six months of last year, a decrease of $11.4 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by interest expense from long-term debt associated with Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed in service during 2002. Income taxes for the first six months of 2003 were $153.9 million, a $14.2 million increase from 2002, due to higher pre-tax income in the 2003 period. ABOUT NISOURCE NiSource Inc.
