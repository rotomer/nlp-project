NEWS [NiSource Logo] 801 E. 86TH AVENUE MERRILLVILLE, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 30, 2003 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MEDIA INVESTORS Kris Falzone Dennis Senchak Director, Corporate Affairs Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-5581 (219) 647-6085 klfalzone@nisource.com senchak@nisource.com Randy Hulen Director, Investor Relations (219) 647-5688 rghulen@nisource.com Rae Kozlowski Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-6083 ekozlowski@nisource.com NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS REFLECT IMPACT OF COST CONTROL, IMPROVED BALANCE SHEET MERRILLVILLE, IND. - Sustained cost containment efforts and lower interest expense contributed to solid earnings from continuing operations for NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) for the third quarter of 2003, despite cooler weather during the summer cooling season and increased pension and insurance costs. NiSource today reported income from continuing operations of $23.5 million, or 9 cents per share (all per share amounts are basic), for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2003, compared with $23.2 million, or 11 cents per share, for the same period in 2002. Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $15.4 million, or 6 cents per share, versus $23.2 million, or 11 cents per share, for the comparable 2002 period. -MORE- - PAGE 1 -
NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS PAGE 2 Income from continuing operations for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2003, was $285.1 million, or $1.10 per share, compared with $263.6 million, or $1.28 per share, for the same period in 2002. During the 2003 period NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations, resulting in a net loss for the nine months ended Sept. 30 of $54.6 million, or a loss of 21 cents per share, versus net income of $290.4 million, or $1.41 per share, for the comparable 2002 period. Taking into consideration reserve changes and environmental insurance recoveries, which decreased 2002 operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses by $37.8 million and decreased 2003 O&M by $20.2 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis, baseline O&M expenses are essentially flat, noted Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our employees' continuing actions to streamline our operations while meeting customer needs have largely offset the effect of increased pension and insurance expenses," Neale stated. "Furthermore, since the end of 2000, we have reduced debt by $2 billion through funds generated from operations, the divestiture of our major non-core assets and the issuance of common equity, helping to drive down interest expense and strengthen our balance sheet." Neale affirmed NiSource's guidance for year-end 2003 earnings of $1.65 per share from continuing operations, assuming normal weather in the fourth quarter. "Our performance through the first nine months of this year shows that we are delivering on our commitments to the marketplace," he added. "Now that we have stabilized our balance sheet and divested non-core assets, we are committed to optimizing the value of our portfolio of regulated utility and pipeline businesses to generate long-term shareholder returns while providing superior customer service." FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THIRD-QUARTER 2003 PERFORMANCE o Interest expense decreased by $23.5 million, or 6 cents per share after tax, compared to the third quarter of 2002, as a result of continued debt reduction and lower short-term interest rates. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest expense from long-term debt associated with Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed in service during 2002. Additional interest expense of $5.9 million, or 1 cent per share after tax, was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 related to this project. o NiSource recognized a pre-tax gain of $16.2 million, or 4 cents per share after tax, from the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc., during the quarter. o The overall effects of weather resulted in a negative impact on operating income of $16.9 million, or 4 cents per share after tax, compared to the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2002. o Administrative and employee-related expenses were reduced by $16.4 million pre-tax, or 4 cents per share after tax, as a result of reorganization initiatives during 2002. o The effects of increased pension expense reduced operating income by $9.4 million, or 2 cents per share after tax. -MORE- - PAGE 2 -
NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS PAGE 3 THIRD QUARTER 2003 OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT NiSource's third quarter 2003 operating income was $148.9 million compared with $178.1 million from the same period in 2002. GAS DISTRIBUTION operations reported an operating loss of $27.2 million versus an operating loss of $20.2 million from the same period in 2002. The increase in the operating loss was mainly attributable to a decrease in net revenues as a result of lower non-weather related gas sales and increased pension costs during the quarter, mostly offset by a reduction in employee-related and administrative expenses as a result of the 2002 reorganization initiatives. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by environmental insurance recoveries. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $90.8 million, an increase of $4.7 million from the comparable 2002 period. The increase was mainly attributable to a reduction in employee-related and administrative expenses. ELECTRIC operations sold 5,144.1 gwh, a decrease of 126.0 gwh from the comparable period last year as a result of cooler weather during the 2003 period. Operating income was $89.5 million, a decrease of $18.1 million from the comparable period last year, resulting from lower net revenues of $9.1 million primarily due to cooler weather in the 2003 period compared to the 2002 period and increased pension and property tax expenses. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $12.3 million, versus operating income of $4.9 million in 2002. The decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in estimated sales taxes related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business that occurred in 2002. CORPORATE operating income was $8.1 million, an increase of $8.4 million from the comparable 2002 period. The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $113.6 million for the quarter compared to $137.1 million for the third quarter of last year, a decrease of $23.5 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by interest expense from long-term debt associated with Whiting Clean Energy, which was placed in service during 2002. Income taxes for the third quarter of 2003 were $13.1 million, a $1.2 million decrease from 2002, mainly due to lower pre-tax income in the 2003 period. -MORE- - PAGE 3 -
NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS PAGE 4 NINE-MONTH PERIOD OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT Operating income was $797.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with $818.2 million for the same period in 2002. GAS DISTRIBUTION throughput for the period decreased by 25.5 MDth to 626.3 MDth; the change is mainly due to a decrease in off system sales. Operating income was $343.8 million, an increase of $79.5 million from the same period in 2002. The improvement was mainly attributable to increased sales and deliveries of natural gas due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003, net of increased uncollectible expenses resulting from a change in the method of calculation and the effects of weather-driven higher gas costs on the residential customer base, and a reduction in employee-related and administrative expenses. The 2002 period was positively impacted by insurance recoveries of environmental expenses. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $289.4 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from the comparable 2002 period, reflecting lower interruptible transmission service revenues and higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas during the first quarter, mostly offset by a reduction in employee-related and administrative expense and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was also unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a reserve related to a long-term note receivable. ELECTRIC operations sold 14,117.0 gwh, a decrease of 107.6 gwh from the comparable period last year as a result of cooler weather during 2003. Operating income was $206.2 million, a decrease of $54.2 million from the comparable period last year, primarily resulting from lower revenues due to credits issued as a result of the IURC electric rate review settlement, cooler weather during the summer season and increased pension expense, partly offset by a reduction in employee-related and administrative expense. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $36.6 million, versus an operating loss of $24.5 million in 2002. The decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in estimated sales taxes related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business that occurred in 2002. CORPORATE operating loss was $5.8 million, versus operating income of $28.5 million in the 2002 period. The decrease was primarily due to the gain on the sale of NiSource's SM&P utility line-locating business in 2002, slightly offset by the gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc. in 2003. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $351.5 million for the first nine months of 2003 compared to $386.4 million for the first nine months of last year, a decrease of $34.9 million due to a reduction of short- and long-term debt and lower short-term interest rates. Income taxes for the first nine months of 2003 were $166.9 million, a $12.9 million increase from 2002, due to higher pre-tax income in the 2003 period. -MORE- - PAGE 4 -
