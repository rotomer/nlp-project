NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NiSource"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of its common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock") and preferred stock, and to issue guarantees of the debt securities issued from time to time by NiSource Finance Corp. as described herein, and NiSource Finance Corp., an Indiana corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource ("NiSource Finance"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of its unsecured debt securities, in each case registered under the registration statement referred to in Section 2(a) ("Registered Securities"). The Registered Securities constituting debt securities will be issued under an indenture, dated as of November 14, 2000 ("Indenture"), among NiSource Finance, NiSource and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee, in one or more series, which series may vary as to interest rates, maturities, redemption provisions, selling prices and other terms. The Registered Securities constituting debt securities will be guaranteed as to principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, by NiSource pursuant to the guarantee set forth in the Indenture, which guarantee will be endorsed on each debt security, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the Indenture (the "Guarantee" and, collectively, the "Guarantees"). The Registered Securities constituting preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, which series may vary as to dividend rates, redemption provisions, selling prices and other terms. Particular series or offerings of Registered Securities will be sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, for resale in accordance with terms of offering determined at the time of sale. The Registered Securities involved in any such offering are hereinafter referred to as the "Offered Securities". The firm or firms which agree to purchase the Offered Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "Underwriters" of such securities, and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 are hereinafter referred to as the "Representatives"; provided, however, that if the Terms Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term "Representatives", as used in this Agreement (other than in Sections 2(b), 5(d) and 6 and the second sentence of Section 3), shall mean the Underwriters. 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NISOURCE AND NISOURCE FINANCE. NiSource and NiSource Finance, as of the date of each Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, represent and warrant to, and agree with, the Underwriters that: (a) A registration statement (No. 333-107421), including a prospectus, relating to the Registered Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") and has become effective. Such registration statement, as amended at the time of any Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as supplemented as contemplated by Section 3 to reflect the terms of the Offered Securities (if they are debt securities or preferred stock) and the terms of the offering of the Offered Securities, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b) ("Rule 424(b)") under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Act"), including all material incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus". No document has been or will be prepared or distributed in reliance on Rule 434 under the Act.

(q) NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Subsidiaries possess adequate certificates, authorities or permits issued by appropriate governmental agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them and have not received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate, authority or permit that, if determined adversely to NiSource, NiSource Finance or any of the Subsidiaries would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

PURCHASE AND OFFERING OF OFFERED SECURITIES. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be evidenced by an agreement or exchange of other written communications ("Terms Agreement") at the time NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, determines to sell the Offered Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate by reference the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the names of the Representatives, the principal amount or number of shares to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters and (if the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock) the terms of the Offered Securities not already specified (in the Indenture, in the case of Offered Securities that are debt securities), including, but not limited to, interest rate (if debt securities), dividend rate (if preferred stock), maturity (if debt securities), any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements and whether any of the Offered Securities may be sold to institutional investors pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined below). The Terms Agreement will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Underwriter first named in the Terms Agreement (the "Lead Underwriter") and NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "Closing Date"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Offered Securities. For purposes of Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Closing Date (if later than the otherwise applicable settlement date) shall be the date for payment of funds and delivery of securities for all the Offered Securities sold pursuant to the offering, other than Contract Securities (as defined below) for which payment of funds and delivery of securities shall be as hereinafter provided. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Offered Securities for sale as set forth in the Prospectus. If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") with such changes therein as NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date NiSource and/or NiSource Finance will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts ("Contract Securities"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If NiSource and/or NiSource Finance execute and deliver Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Securities will be deducted from the Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Lead Underwriter determines that such reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and so advises NiSource and/or NiSource Finance. NiSource and/or NiSource Finance will advise the Lead Underwriter not later than the business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount or number of shares of Contract Securities. If the Offered Securities are preferred stock or Common Stock, the certificates for the Offered Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive form, and if the Offered Securities are debt securities, the Offered Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive fully registered form, in each case in such denominations and registered in such names as the Lead Underwriter requests. If the Offered Securities are debt securities and the Terms Agreement specifies "Book-Entry Only" settlement or otherwise states that the provisions of this paragraph shall apply, NiSource Finance will deliver against payment of the purchase price the Offered Securities in the form of one or more permanent global securities in definitive form (the "Global Securities") deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Interests in any permanent global securities will be held only in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in the Prospectus. Payment for the Offered Securities shall be made by the Underwriters in Federal (same day) funds by official check or checks or wire transfer to an account previously designated by NiSource Finance at a bank acceptable to the Lead Underwriter, in each case drawn to the order of NiSource Finance at the place of payment specified in the Terms Agreement on the Closing Date, against delivery to the Trustee as custodian for DTC of the Global Securities representing all of the Offered Securities. 4. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF NISOURCE AND NISOURCE FINANCE. Each of NiSource and NiSource Finance agrees with the several Underwriters that it will furnish to counsel for the Underwriters, one copy of the executed registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, including all exhibits, in the form it became effective and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with each offering of Offered Securities: (a) NiSource and NiSource Finance will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b)(2) (or, if applicable and if consented to by the Lead Underwriter, subparagraph (5)) not later than the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement. (b) NiSource and NiSource Finance will advise the Lead Underwriter promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and will afford the Lead Underwriter a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and NiSource and NiSource Finance will also advise the Lead Underwriter promptly of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued. (c) NiSource will comply with the provisions of the Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations so as to permit completion of the distribution of the Offered Securities as contemplated by the applicable Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Offered Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, NiSource and NiSource Finance promptly will notify the Lead Underwriter of such event and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at the expense of NiSource and NiSource Finance, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. Neither the Lead Underwriter's consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof. (d) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months, after the date of each Terms Agreement, NiSource will make generally available to its securityholders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the later of (i) the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such Terms Agreement and (iii) the date of NiSource's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such Terms Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act. (e) NiSource or NiSource Finance will furnish to the Representatives copies of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits, any related preliminary prospectus, any related preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Lead Underwriter reasonably requests. NiSource or NiSource Finance will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Underwriters all such documents. (f) NiSource or NiSource Finance will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Lead Underwriter designates and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution, provided that, in connection with such qualification, neither NiSource nor NiSource Finance shall be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction. (g) During the period of five years after the date of any Terms Agreement, NiSource will furnish to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to stockholders for such year; and NiSource will furnish to the Representative (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report and any definitive proxy statement of NiSource filed with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or mailed to stockholders, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning NiSource or NiSource Finance as the Lead Underwriter may reasonably request. (h) Each of NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), any filing fees or other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) in connection with qualification of the Registered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Lead Underwriter may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities (if they are debt securities or preferred stock), any applicable filing fee incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the Registered Securities, and any travel expenses of its officers and employees and any other expenses incurred by it in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of Registered Securities. (i) If the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock, neither NiSource nor NiSource Finance will offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Act relating to United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued by NiSource Finance and guaranteed by NiSource and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue (if the Offered Securities are debt securities) or any series of preferred stock issued by NiSource (if the Offered Securities are preferred stock), or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Representatives for a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and ending the number of days after the Closing Date specified under "Blackout" in the Terms Agreement.

(xiv) The execution and delivery by each of NiSource and NiSource Finance of the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) do not, and the performance by each of NiSource and NiSource Finance of its respective obligations under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities, will not, (i) violate the certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws of NiSource or NiSource Finance, (ii) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to NiSource or NiSource Finance and generally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) undertaken by issuers engaged in businesses similar to the businesses of NiSource and NiSource Finance, (iii) violate any judgment, injunction, order or decree identified by an officer of NiSource or NiSource Finance as material to NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole (which judgments, injunctions, orders and decrees, if any, shall be set forth in a certificate attached to the opinion), or (iv) breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, instrument or agreement which is filed as an exhibit to or filed as an exhibit through incorporation by reference to either NiSource's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended on the December 31 preceding the date of delivery of such opinion or any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Report on Form 8-K filed subsequent to the date of such Form 10-K; (xv) The descriptions in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus of any statutes, legal and governmental proceedings, contracts and documents, insofar as such statements purport to constitute summaries of matters of law and legal conclusions with respect thereto, are correct in all material respects; and such counsel do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending to which NiSource, NiSource Finance or any Subsidiary is a party or to which any of their respective properties is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so described, or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not so described or filed as required;

such counsel have had no facts come to their attention that have led them to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as supplemented as of the date of the prospectus supplement or as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and (xvii) The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and, if the Offered Securities are debt securities issued by NiSource Finance and guaranteed by NiSource or preferred stock, the Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be.

In rendering such opinion, Dewey Ballantine LLP may rely as to the incorporation of NiSource Finance and all other matters governed by Indiana law upon the opinion of Schiff Hardin & Waite referred to above.

(g) If the Offered Securities are debt securities, the Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of NiSource Finance in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of NiSource Finance in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, that NiSource Finance has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission and that, subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.

Each of NiSource and NiSource Finance agrees to furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request. The Lead Underwriter may in its sole discretion waive on behalf of the Underwriters compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement. 6. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) NiSource and NiSource Finance, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that NiSource and NiSource Finance will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to NiSource or NiSource Finance by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement; AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus or prospectus supplement the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Offered Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to such Offered Securities was required to be delivered by such Underwriter under the Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person, a copy of the prospectus or prospectus supplement (exclusive of material incorporated by reference) if NiSource or NiSource Finance had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless NiSource and NiSource Finance, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls each of NiSource and NiSource Finance within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which NiSource or NiSource Finance may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to NiSource or NiSource Finance by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by NiSource or NiSource Finance in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by NiSource and NiSource Finance bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (e) The obligations of NiSource and NiSource Finance under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which NiSource or NiSource Finance may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of NiSource and NiSource Finance, to each officer of NiSource and NiSource Finance who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls NiSource or NiSource Finance within the meaning of the Act. 7. DEFAULT OF UNDERWRITERS. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or NiSource or NiSource Finance, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. If the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock, the respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts (if debt securities) or numbers of shares (if preferred stock) of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be. 8. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of NiSource, NiSource Finance or their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, NiSource, NiSource Finance or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, NiSource and NiSource Finance shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.

Dated: November 4, 2003 NISOURCE FINANCE CORP. By: ________________________________ Name: David J. Vajda Title: Vice President and Treasurer By: _________________________________ Name: Gary W. Pottorff Title: Secretary TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Notes of the series referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Trustee By:____________________________ Authorized Officer Floating Rate Note due 2005 1. Interest NiSource Finance Corp., an Indiana corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note quarterly in arrears on February 4, May 4, August 4 and November 4 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing February 4, 2004, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay). The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day prior to such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof. The Notes of this series will bear interest for each Interest Period at a per annum rate determined by the Calculation Agent, subject to the maximum interest rate permitted by New York or other applicable law, as such law may be modified by United States law of general application. The interest rate applicable during each Interest Period will be equal to LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date for such Interest Period plus 0.75%; provided, however, that in certain circumstances described below, the interest rate will be determined without reference to LIBOR. Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and the Trustee, if the Trustee is not then serving as the Calculation Agent, of the interest rate for the new Interest Period. The interest rate determined by the Calculation Agent, absent manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive upon the Holder of this Note, the Company and the Trustee. If the following circumstances exist on any Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall determine the interest rate for the Notes of this series as follows: (1) In the event no Reported Rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on an Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major banks (which may include any underwriters participating in the original offering of this Note and their affiliates) in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide a quotation of the rate (the "Rate Quotation") at which three- month deposits in amounts of not less than $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date, that is representative of single transactions at such time (the "Representative Amounts"). If at least two Rate Quotations are provided, the interest rate will be the arithmetic mean of the Rate Quotations obtained by the Calculation Agent, plus 0.75%. (2) In the event no Reported Rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on an Interest Determination Date and there are fewer than two Rate Quotations, the interest rate will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date, by three major banks (which may include any underwriters participating in the original offering of this Note and their affiliates) in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), for loans in Representative Amounts in U. S. dollars to leading European banks, having an index maturity of three months for a period commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, plus 0.75%; provided, however, that if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting such rates, the interest rate for the applicable Interest Period will be the same as the interest rate in effect for the immediately preceding Interest Period. "Calculation Agent" means JPMorgan Chase Bank, or its successor appointed by the Company, acting as calculation agent. "Interest Determination Date" means the second London Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant Interest Period. "Interest Period" means the period commencing on an Interest Payment Date (or, with respect to the initial Interest Period only, commencing on November 4, 2003) and ending on the day before the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. "LIBOR," for any Interest Determination Date, will be the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months for a period commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following the Interest Determination Date in amounts of not less than $1,000,000, as such rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 or a successor reporter of such rates selected by the Calculation Agent and acceptable to the Company, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date (the "Reported Rate"). "London Business Day" means a day that is a Business Day and a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted, or with respect to any future date are expected to be transacted, in the London interbank market. "Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated on page 3750 on Moneyline Telerate, Inc. (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on that service or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward). Upon the request of a Holder of this Note, the Calculation Agent will provide to such Holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next Interest Period. Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday or a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is closed for business. 2. Method of Payment The Company will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day prior to the Interest Payment Date even if Notes are canceled after the Record Date and on or before the Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). Holders must surrender Notes to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Notes represented by a Global Note (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. 3. Guarantee NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation and parent of the Company, will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each Holder of the Notes and to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly, The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee") under the Indenture (as defined below) and its successors all the Obligations of the Company under the Notes, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes (the "Security Guarantee"). The Security Guarantee applies whether the payment is due at Stated Maturity, on an Interest Payment Date or as a result of acceleration, redemption or otherwise. The Security Guarantee includes payment of interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes (if lawful) and all other Obligations of the Company under the Indenture. The Security Guarantee will remain valid even if the Indenture is found to be invalid. NiSource Inc. is obligated under the Security Guarantee to pay any guaranteed amount immediately after the Company's failure to do so. 4. Paying Agent and Security Registrar Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Security Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Company may act as Paying Agent or Security Registrar. 5. Indenture The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of November 14, 2000, among the Company, NiSource Inc. and the Trustee (as supplemented, the "Indenture") and pursuant to an Officers' Certificate of the Company dated October 30, 2003 (the "Officer's Certificate"). The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and the Officer's Certificate and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Officer's Certificate (the "Act"). Capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Indenture but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, NiSource Inc. and their Subsidiaries (other than Utilities) to incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets unless the total amount of all the secured debt would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 6. Optional Redemption The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after May 4, 2004 at its option at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date. 7. Notice of Redemption If the Company is redeeming less than all the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed using a method it considers fair and appropriate. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed in accordance with Section 106 of the Indenture. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 8. Additional Notes The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue Additional Notes ranking equally with the Notes in all respects, including having the same CUSIP number, so that such Additional Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and shall have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Notes. No Additional Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes. 9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. 10. Persons Deemed Owners The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 11. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee, the Paying Agent or NiSource Inc., as guarantor, for payment. 12. Satisfaction and Discharge Under the Indenture, the Company can terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation when those Notes have become due and payable or will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving notice of redemption. The Company may terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes by depositing with the Trustee, as funds in trust dedicated solely for that purpose, an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes. In that case, the Indenture will cease to be of further effect and the Company's obligations will be satisfied and discharged with respect to the Notes (except as to the Company's obligations to pay all other amounts due under the Indenture and to provide certain Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel to the Trustee). At the expense of the Company, the Trustee will execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge. 13. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee shall be entitled to amend the Indenture to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or to evidence the succession of another Person as obligor under the Indenture, or to add to the Company's or NiSource Inc.'s covenants or to surrender any right or power conferred on the Company or NiSource Inc. under the Indenture, or to add events of default, or to secure the Notes, or to evidence or provide for the acceptance or appointment by a successor Trustee or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the Indenture by more than one trustee, or to effect assumption by NiSource Inc. or one of its Subsidiaries of the Company's obligations under the Indenture, or to conform the Indenture to any amendment of the Trust Indenture Act. 14. Defaults and Remedies Under the Indenture, Events of Default include: (i) default by the Company in the payment of any interest upon any Note and the continuance of such default for 60 days; (ii) default by the Company in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Note when due at Stated Maturity, on redemption, by declaration or otherwise, and the continuance of such default for three Business Days; (iii) default by the Company or NiSource Inc. in the performance of or breach of any covenant or warranty in the Indenture and continuance of such default for 90 days after written notice to the Company or NiSource Inc. from the Trustee or to the Company, NiSource Inc. and the Trustee from the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; (iv) default by the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc., or the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. defaults under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued, secured or evidenced indebtedness constituting a failure to pay in excess of $50,000,000 of the principal or interest when due and payable, subject to certain cure rights; (v) the guarantee by NiSource Inc. ceases to be in full force and effect or is disaffirmed or denied (other than according to its terms), or is found to be unenforceable or invalid; or (vi) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. or NiSource Inc. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders. 15. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 16. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, NiSource Inc. or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture, or any obligations of NiSource Inc. under the Security Guarantee or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes and the Security Guarantee. 17. Authentication This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an Authenticating Agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note. 18. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 19. CUSIP, ISIN and Common Code Numbers Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. To the extent such numbers have been issued, the Company has caused ISIN and Common Code numbers to be similarly printed on the Notes and has similarly instructed the Trustee. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon. 20.

The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and the Officer's Certificate and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Officer's Certificate (the "Act"). Capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Indenture but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, NiSource Inc. and their Subsidiaries (other than Utilities) to incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets unless the total amount of all the secured debt would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 6. Optional Redemption The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date or (2) the Make-Whole Amount for the Notes being redeemed. For purposes of this provision: "Make-Whole Amount" means the sum, as determined by a Quotation Agent, of the present values of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with scheduled payments of interest (exclusive of interest to the Redemption Date) from the Redemption Date to the Stated Maturity of the Notes, in each case discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus accrued interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date, in each case calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date, plus 0.20%. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term from the Redemption Date to the Stated Maturity of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, if clause (ii) of the definition of Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of three, or such lesser number as is obtained by the Trustee, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date. "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date. 7. Notice of Redemption If the Company is redeeming less than all the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed using a method it considers fair and appropriate. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed in accordance with Section 106 of the Indenture. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. The Company will not know the exact Redemption Price until three Business Days before the Redemption Date. Therefore, the notice of redemption will only describe how the Redemption Price will be calculated. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 8. Additional Notes The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue Additional Notes ranking equally with the Notes in all respects, including having the same CUSIP number, so that such Additional Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and shall have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Notes. No Additional Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes. 9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed. 10. Persons Deemed Owners The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 11. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee, the Paying Agent or NiSource Inc., as guarantor, for payment. 12. Satisfaction and Discharge Under the Indenture, the Company can terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation when those Notes have become due and payable or will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving notice of redemption. The Company may terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes by depositing with the Trustee, as funds in trust dedicated solely for that purpose, an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes. In that case, the Indenture will cease to be of further effect and the Company's obligations will be satisfied and discharged with respect to the Notes (except as to the Company's obligations to pay all other amounts due under the Indenture and to provide certain Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel to the Trustee). At the expense of the Company, the Trustee will execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge. 13.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders. 15. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 16. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, NiSource Inc. or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture, or any obligations of NiSource Inc. under the Security Guarantee or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes and the Security Guarantee. 17.
