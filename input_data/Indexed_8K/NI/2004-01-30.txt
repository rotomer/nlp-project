[NEWS LOGO] [NISOURCE LOGO] 801 E. 86TH AVENUE MERRILLVILLE, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 30, 2004 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MEDIA INVESTORS Kris Falzone Dennis Senchak Vice President, Corporate Communications Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-5581 (219) 647-6085 klfalzone@nisource.com senchak@nisource.com INVESTORS Randy Hulen Rae Kozlowski Director, Investor Relations Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-5688 (219) 647-6083 rghulen@nisource.com ekozlowski@nisource.com NISOURCE REPORTS STRONG 2003 EARNINGS EARNINGS IMPROVE ON LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AND COLDER WEATHER MERRILLVILLE, IND. -- NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) delivered on its commitments to investors during 2003 and is well positioned for 2004, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Gary L. Neale said today as the company reported strong earnings for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2003. "We accomplished what we set out to do in 2003," Neale said. "We strengthened our balance sheet, completed the announced divestitures of our major non-core assets, held the line on operation and maintenance costs and continued our focus on meeting customers' expectations while generating solid shareholder returns." Colder weather and lower interest expense contributed to improved income from continuing operations for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, of $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, compared with $398.1 million, or $1.89 per share, in 2002. Taking into consideration results from discontinued operations, net income was $85.2 million, or $0.33 per share, for 2003, compared with $372.5 million, or $1.77 per share, in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2002. There were 48.6 million more average shares outstanding at Dec. 31, 2003, compared with the end of 2002. Weather in NiSource's gas markets was 7.9 percent colder overall during the year than in 2002, Neale noted, resulting in improved natural gas sales by the company's utility assets. This favorable impact was slightly offset by a cooler summer in northern Indiana compared with 2002, reducing electric sales. -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS STRONG 2003 EARNINGS PAGE 2 For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2003, income from continuing operations was $140.6 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with $134.5 million, or $0.59 per share, for the same period a year ago. The company reported net income of $139.8 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with net income of $82.1 million, or $0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. Weather was 12.8 percent warmer in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with the year-ago period. "One of our major accomplishments in 2003 was our continued progress in reducing debt," Neale noted. "Since the end of 2000, we've reduced debt by $2 billion through funds generated from operations, the divestiture of our major non-core assets and the issuance of common equity, helping to drive down interest expense and strengthen our balance sheet." Debt reduction and the elimination of risk associated with non-core businesses were positive factors in securing stable credit ratings from all three rating agencies, Neale said. During 2003, Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings all affirmed NiSource's investment grade credit ratings with a stable outlook. Another key accomplishment during 2003 was the development of a new corporate structure creating a focus on NiSource's key constituencies as well as the continued delivery of safe, reliable and cost-effective utility and pipeline services. With NiSource's core businesses now virtually 100 percent regulated, Robert C. Skaggs, Jr., executive vice president, Regulated Revenue, leads a team that works across all NiSource markets to develop regulatory strategies that benefit both customers and shareholders. Samuel W. Miller, Jr., executive vice president and chief operating officer, is responsible for the delivery of natural gas and electricity to NiSource's 3.7 million distribution customers and the transmission and storage of natural gas in the pipeline business. Neale emphasized that under the new structure, employees are building a coordinated and integrated strategy for NiSource's distribution businesses, electric generation and transmission, pipelines and corporate support functions. "Our organizational changes allow us to focus on working collectively to become the best company we can be in the eyes of our customers and shareholders," he said. For 2004, Neale said NiSource will continue to control O&M costs to contribute to profitability and continued reasonable prices for customers; focus on regulated revenue growth from its utility and pipeline businesses to reduce risk and produce solid returns; employ capital effectively to foster disciplined growth; standardize operations where appropriate to improve service and lower costs; and move to best-in-class processes to provide good customer service at reasonable costs to benefit both customers and shareholders. "Meeting these goals will help us deliver earnings per share for 2004 in a range of $1.65 to $1.70, assuming normal weather and an estimate of customer usage patterns consistent with current gas prices," Neale said. -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS STRONG 2003 EARNINGS PAGE 3 FOURTH QUARTER 2003 OPERATING INCOME NiSource's consolidated fourth quarter 2003 operating income was $319.3 million compared with $334.0 million for the same period in 2002. This decrease in operating income was due largely to warmer weather for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2003, compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, and increased employee benefits and pension expenses, mainly offset by a gain on the sale of NiSource's interest in Mid-Tex Gas Storage Company LLP, the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia Gas of Ohio that allowed for the recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable, and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2003, is discussed below. GAS DISTRIBUTION throughput for the period decreased by 19.8 MDth to 252.6 MDth, largely due to reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather during the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with the same period in 2002. Operating income was $162.6 million, a decrease of $32.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2002. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower net revenues as a result of warmer weather in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with the same period in 2002. Operating expenses decreased slightly as a result of lower gross receipts taxes and the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia Gas of Ohio that allowed for the recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable, mostly offset by increased employee benefit expenses, and increased pension and post-retirement expenses. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $109.4 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the prior year. The 2002 period was unfavorably impacted by increased expenses related to NiSource's reorganization initiatives and other employee-related costs and favorably impacted by a reduction in reserves related to unaccounted-for gas. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $61.3 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the comparable period last year primarily resulting from increased property taxes and pension expense, partially offset by lower electric production expenses. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $7.1 million, an improvement of $11.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, largely due to a gain on the sale of NiSource's interest in Mid-Tex Gas Storage and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003. CORPORATE operating loss was $6.9 million, versus an operating loss of $13.0 million from the comparable 2002 period. The 2002 period was unfavorably impacted by restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter as part of the reorganization initiative. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $113.2 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16.8 million from the same period in 2002, due to a quarter-over-quarter reduction in short-term borrowings and lower short- and long-term interest rates. Income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $67.3 million, a $2.4 million increase from 2002 mainly resulting from higher pre-tax income. -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS STRONG 2003 EARNINGS PAGE 4 TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD OPERATING INCOME NiSource's consolidated operating income was $1,116.3 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, compared with $1,152.2 million for the same period in 2002. Net revenue decreased $10.6 million as a result of lower interruptible transmission service revenues, higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas and credits issued to electric customers pursuant to the 2002 rate review settlement with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), partially offset by increased sales and deliveries of natural gas due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003. Operating expenses increased $25.3 million from the comparable 2002 period mainly as a result of higher gross receipts taxes. NiSource's business segment operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, is discussed below. GAS DISTRIBUTION throughput for the period decreased by 45.3 MDth to 878.9 MDth, mainly due to lower off-system sales, slightly offset by increased residential and commercial sales as a result of colder weather during the first quarter of 2003. Operating income was $506.4 million for the 12-month period, an increase of $47.3 million from the same period in 2002. Operating income improved as a result of higher net revenues from increased sales and deliveries of natural gas due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher pension and post-retirement expenses, higher gross receipts taxes and insurance recoveries for environmental expenses in the 2002 period, slightly offset by a reduction in administrative and employee related expenses and the approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia Gas of Ohio that allowed for the recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $398.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million from the 2002 period, reflecting a reduction in administrative and employee related expenses, and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. These benefits to operating income were for the most part offset by lower interruptible transmission service revenues and higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas during the first quarter of 2003. The 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in reserves related to unaccounted-for gas and unfavorably impacted by the recognition of a reserve related to a long-term note receivable. ELECTRIC operations sold 18,439.2 gwh for the year, a decrease of 336.7 gwh from last year primarily as a result of cooler weather during the summer season of 2003 and reduced wholesale sales. Operating income was $267.5 million, a decrease of $54.8 million from last year resulting from the impact of unfavorable weather during the summer season, lower revenues due to credits issued to electric customers pursuant to the 2002 rate review settlement with the IURC, increased pension expense and increased property tax expense, partially offset by decreased administrative and employee related expenses and lower uncollectible receivables expense. -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS STRONG 2003 EARNINGS PAGE 5 The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $43.8 million, versus an operating loss of $43.1 million in the 2002 period. 2002 operating expenses were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing business, mostly offset by expenses associated with the July 1, 2002 sale of a portfolio of EnergyUSA-TPC gas marketing contracts. The 2003 period included a gain on the sale of NiSource's interest in Mid-Tex Gas Storage and a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, both periods included losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy. CORPORATE operating loss was $12.6 million, versus operating income of $15.6 million in the 2002 period. The decrease was primarily due to the gain on the sale of NiSource's SM&P utility line-locating business in 2002. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $464.7 million for the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2003, compared to $516.4 million for the 12 months of 2002, a decrease of $51.7 million due to a year-over-year reduction in short-term borrowings and lower short- and long-term interest rates. Income taxes for the 12 months of 2003 were $234.2 million, a $15.3 million increase from 2002, mainly resulting from higher pre-tax income. ABOUT NISOURCE NiSource Inc.
