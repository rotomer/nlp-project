NEWS [NISOURCE(R) LOGO] 801 E. 86TH AVENUE MERRILLVILLE, IN 46410 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 30, 2004 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MEDIA INVESTORS Kris Falzone Dennis Senchak Vice President, Corporate Communications Vice President, Investor Relations (219) 647-5581 (219) 647-6085 klfalzone@nisource.com senchak@nisource.com Carol Churchill Randy Hulen Director, Corporate Communications Director, Investor Relations (888) 696-0481 (219) 647-5688 cchurchill@nisource.com rghulen@nisource.com Rae Kozlowski Manager, Investor Relations (219) 647-6083 ekozlowski@nisource.com NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS RETURN TO NORMAL WEATHER, OPERATING EXPENSE CONTROL AND BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENT ARE KEY FACTORS IN FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS MERRILLVILLE, IND. - NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004, of $216.5 million, or 83 cents per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $222.3 million, or 88 cents per share, for the first quarter of 2003. Net income was $213.5 million, or 81 cents per share, for the first quarter of 2004. This compares to net income of $254.9 million, or $1.00 per share, for the year-ago period. NiSource's net income reflects the impact of discontinued operations that earned $41.4 million in the first quarter of 2003, including a gain from the sale of the company's interest in certain natural gas exploration and production assets in New York state. NiSource issued 13.1 million shares of common stock in February 2003 associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements under NiSource's Premium Income Equity Securities. If the shares issued in February had been outstanding the entire first quarter of 2003, the per-share results for the first quarter of 2003 would have been reduced by 3 cents. -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS PAGE 2 "Warmer weather and lower pipeline interruptible revenues during the crucial winter heating season, partially offset by lower operating expenses and interest costs, were the primary factors affecting our first-quarter results," stated Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our strong portfolio of regulated utility and pipeline businesses delivers relatively stable earnings, taking into consideration the variables of weather and customer usage. Our first-quarter earnings were within 1 cent per share of our 2004 operating plan. "Our employees' ongoing efforts to continually control costs have held operation and maintenance expenses flat," Neale continued. "At the same time, our ongoing actions to reduce debt have resulted in significant improvements to the company's balance sheet and reduced interest expense." FACTORS AFFECTING FIRST-QUARTER PERFORMANCE - Weather in the markets served by NiSource's natural gas utility and pipeline companies was close to normal during the first quarter of 2004, but 6 percent warmer compared with the year-ago period. - Both this quarter and the first quarter of 2003 reflect lower interruptible transmission service revenues than those that have been historically realized by NiSource's pipeline business. Management has evaluated operational and market conditions, and anticipates that there will be fewer opportunities for interruptible revenue on an ongoing basis. - Interest expense for the first quarter of 2004 decreased by $20.3 million, or 16.5 percent, compared with the year-ago period. - NiSource continues to improve its capital structure, with a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 58 percent, compared with 60 percent at year-end 2003. - Whiting Clean Energy continued to experience losses due to the market for wholesale power and the contract requirements to run the plant at a level to produce steam required by the BP refinery in Whiting, Ind. These contract requirements currently are being renegotiated. Also during the first quarter, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) adopted a regulatory stipulation submitted by NiSource subsidiary Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) and its regulatory collaborative, but with modifications to several key components of the agreement. On April 9, COH and the other signatory parties filed with the PUCO a joint application for rehearing. "We are pleased with the support of the collaborative parties to the application for rehearing," Neale noted. "We continue to focus on operating our utilities and pipelines to produce solid returns, while strengthening our balance sheet," Neale said. "Our experienced management team, low-risk business model and strategy for growth that builds on our portfolio of regulated assets will continue to create long-term shareholder value." -MORE-
NISOURCE REPORTS EARNINGS PAGE 3 FIRST QUARTER 2004 OPERATING INCOME NiSource's consolidated first quarter 2004 operating income was $442.6 million compared with $472.3 million for the same period in 2003. This decrease in operating income was due largely to warmer weather for the three months ended March 31, 2004, compared to the first quarter of 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, is discussed below. GAS DISTRIBUTION throughput for the period decreased by 7.1 MMDth to 353.5 MMDth, largely due to reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather during the first quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. Operating income was $285.0 million, a decrease of $29.2 million versus the first quarter of 2003. The decrease in operating income was mainly attributable to lower net revenues as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. GAS TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE operations reported operating income of $111.4 million, which was essentially unchanged from the year ago period. The 2003 period was unfavorably impacted by higher costs to meet customer demand during a period of sustained cold weather in the Northeast market areas during the first quarter of 2003. Both this quarter and the first quarter of 2003 reflect lower interruptible transmission service revenues than those that have been historically realized. Management has evaluated operational and market conditions and anticipates that there will be fewer opportunities for interruptible revenue on an ongoing basis. These lower interruptible revenues are reflected in the current quarter's results. Operation and maintenance expenses are slightly higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis, after taking into consideration reserve changes, which increased 2003 operation and maintenance expenses by $2.8 million. ELECTRIC operations reported operating income of $58.8 million, an increase of $6.2 million from the comparable period last year primarily resulting from customer settlement obligations during the quarter that reduced net revenues in the 2003 period. The OTHER segment reported an operating loss of $18.2 million in 2004, versus an operating loss of $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2003, largely due to increased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy. CORPORATE operating income was $5.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from the comparable 2003 period. The decrease was a result of the reduction of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the first quarter of 2003, slightly offset by a settlement in 2004 relating to a lawsuit. OTHER ITEMS Interest expense was $102.7 million for the 2004 quarter, a decrease of $20.3 million from the same period in 2003, due to lower short- and long-term interest rates and a quarter over quarter reduction in debt balances. Income taxes for the first quarter of 2004 were $125.6 million, a $1.8 million decrease from 2003 mainly resulting from lower pre-tax income. -MORE-
