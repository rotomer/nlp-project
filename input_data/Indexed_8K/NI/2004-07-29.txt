EXHIBIT 99.1
July 29, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported income from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004, of $35.3 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with $39.3 million, or 15 cents per share, for the same period in 2003.
MERRILLVILLE, Ind. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $34.6 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $324.9 million, or a loss of $1.24 per share, during the second quarter of 2003. During the second quarter of 2003, NiSource recognized losses associated with the sale of Columbia Energy Resources, Inc., and certain assets of NiSource's former subsidiary, Primary Energy, Inc. The losses were recorded as discontinued operations, resulting in the net loss reported for that quarter.

Operating income for the second quarter was $157.5 million in 2004, compared to $175.8 million in 2003. Items that impacted the respective quarters were as follows:
Taking into consideration the above items, operating income was approximately the same in both periods.
"Weather during the second quarter of 2004 in our gas distribution service territories was 10 percent warmer than normal and 11 percent warmer than the year-ago period, reducing sales of natural gas to our residential and commercial customers," said Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Second-quarter degree days indicated that weather in our electric service territory was 10 percent cooler than normal, but favorable compared to the same quarter last year, which resulted in increased usage by our electric customers. In addition, our employees continued to hold the line on operation and maintenance expenses."
Neale noted that interest expense was $15.3 million lower compared with the year-ago period as a result of a quarter-over-quarter reduction in debt balances along with lower average long-term borrowing rates attributable to debt refinancings completed during 2003.
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $251.8 million, or 96 cents per share, compared with $261.6 million, or $1.02 per share, in the same period of 2003. Net income for the first six months of 2004 was $248.1 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $70.0 million, or a loss of 27 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations during the 2003 period, resulting in the net loss reported for that period.

Second Quarter 2004 Operating Income
NiSource's consolidated second quarter 2004 operating income was $157.5 million compared with $175.8 million for the same period in 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, is discussed below.
operating income was $15.1 million, a decrease of $41.7 million versus the second quarter of 2003. The decrease in operating income was mainly attributable to lower net revenues as a result of warmer weather and lower non-traditional revenues in the second quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003 and adjustments recorded in 2003 for gas costs associated with certain customers. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2004 were higher than 2003. The 2003 period expenses were positively impacted by a weather insurance refund and a revised allocation methodology of corporate employee and administrative costs that lowered expenses, offset by higher corporate segment expenses. Gas Distribution Operations' throughput for the period increased by 22.5 MMDth to 176.4 MMDth, largely due to increased lower margin off-system sales, partially offset by reduced residential sales as a result of warmer weather during the second quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003.
Gas Distribution Operations'
reported operating income of $73.5 million, a $13.8 million decrease from the same period in 2003. This decrease in operating income is mainly from a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $82.0 million, an increase of $17.9 million from the comparable period last year. Higher customer usage and favorable weather during the quarter drove the increase in net revenue of $6.8 million from the comparable 2003 period. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2004 decreased versus the same period in 2003 mainly as a result of reducing an accrual for estimated property tax expense.
Electric Operations
The segment reported an operating loss of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2004, versus an operating loss of $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. The change in operating loss is due to lower operation and maintenance expense as a result of reduced employee and administrative expenses during the second quarter of 2004 as compared the same period in 2003.
Other Operations
operating loss was $5.0 million, an improvement of $17.0 million from the comparable 2003 period. The improvement was due to a change in the allocation methodology of corporate costs in 2003 that led to higher employee and administrative expenses in the corporate segment, offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses in the other segments. The 2004 period was favorably impacted by a litigation settlement during the second quarter.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $99.6 million for the second quarter of 2004, a decrease of $15.3 million from the same period in 2003, due mainly to lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and a quarter-over-quarter reduction in debt balances. Other, net, decreased by $5.3 million as a result of decreased interest income in the 2004 period. Income taxes for the second quarter of 2004 were $22.1 million, a $4.3 million decrease from 2003 mainly resulting from lower pre-tax income.

Six-Month Period 2004 Operating Income
Operating income was $600.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared with $648.2 million for the same period in 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2004, is discussed below.
operating income was $300.1 million, a decrease of $70.9 million versus the first half of 2003. The decrease in operating income was mainly attributable to lower net revenues as a result of warmer weather and lower non-traditional revenues in the first half of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. Gas Distribution Operations' throughput for the period increased by 15.4 MMDth to 529.9 MMDth, largely due to increased lower margin off-system and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather during the first half of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003.
Gas Distribution Operations'
reported operating income of $184.9 million, a $13.7 million decrease from the comparable 2003 period primarily due to a reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003. Both the six-months ended 2004 and the first half of 2003 reflect lower interruptible transmission service revenues than those that have been historically realized. Management has evaluated operational issues and market conditions and anticipates that there will be fewer opportunities for interruptible revenue on an ongoing basis. These lower interruptible revenues are reflected in the current year-to-date results.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $140.8 million, an increase of $24.1 million from the comparable period last year primarily from higher net revenues as a result of increased customer usage and favorable weather during the first half of 2004 versus the first half of 2003 and a reduction of an accrual for estimated property tax expense.
Electric Operations
The segment reported an operating loss of $26.3 million in the first half of 2004, versus an operating loss of $24.3 million in the first half of 2003, mainly due to ongoing losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and lower power trading revenues during the first half of 2004 as compared the same period in 2003.
Other Operations
operating income was $0.6 million, an improvement of $14.4 million from the comparable 2003 period. The improvement was due to a change in the allocation methodology of corporate costs in 2003 that led to higher employee and administrative expenses in the corporate segment, offset by decreased employee and administrative expenses in the other segments. The 2004 period was also favorably impacted by a litigation settlement.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $202.3 million for the first six months of 2004 compared to $237.9 million for the first six months of last year, a decrease of $35.6 million mainly due to lower short-term debt balances and lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed during 2003. Other, net, decreased by $6.1 million as a result of decreased interest income in the 2004 period. Income taxes for the first six months of 2004 were $147.7 million, a $6.2 million decrease from 2003, due to lower pre-tax income in the 2004 period.
