EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 99.1
October 27, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported income from continuing operations for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2004, of $21.5 million, or 8 cents per share (all per-share amounts are basic), compared with $23.5 million, or 9 cents per share, for the same period in 2003.
MERRILLVILLE, Ind. 
Net income for the third quarter of 2004 was $28.8 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $15.4 million, or 6 cents per share, during the third quarter of 2003.
"Our core utility and pipeline businesses continue to deliver solid performance," said Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Mild weather during the summer cooling season in our northern Indiana electric market caused decreased usage by our residential and commercial electric customers, impacting earnings by 3 cents during the third quarter compared with normal weather. However, sales to industrial customers increased as the economy improved."
Neale added that the weather impact to NiSource's electric business followed warmer weather during the second quarter in the company's gas distribution markets, which, as previously reported, reduced sales of natural gas to residential and commercial customers during that time period.
"Based on these factors, we are revising our earnings expectations for the year," Neale said. "We now expect NiSource will deliver earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.60 for 2004, assuming normal weather and customer usage patterns through the remainder of the year."

Operating income for the third quarter was $127.8 million in 2004, compared to $148.9 million in 2003. Significant items that impacted the respective quarters were as follows:
Excluding the above items, operating expenses declined when comparing the two periods, and operating income improved.
Neale noted that interest expense was $13.6 million lower compared with the year-ago period as a result of a quarter-over-quarter reduction in debt balances along with lower average long-term borrowing rates attributable to debt refinancings completed in 2003.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2004, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $273.3 million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $285.1 million, or $1.10 per share, in the same period of 2003. Net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $276.9 million, or $1.06 per share, compared with a net loss of $54.6 million, or a net loss of 21 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations during the 2003 period, resulting in the net loss reported for that period.

Third Quarter 2004 Operating Income
NiSource's consolidated third quarter 2004 operating income was $127.8 million compared with $148.9 million for the same period in 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, is discussed below.
reported an operating loss of $35.7 million versus an operating loss of $27.2 million in the third quarter of 2003. Operating expenses for the third quarter 2004 were higher than 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by a reversal of reserves. The current period was favorably impacted by a decrease in uncollectible expense largely attributable to the bad debt cost tracker that was approved for Columbia Gas of Ohio in December 2003, partially offset by an increase in employee and administrative expenses. Gas Distribution Operations' throughput for the period increased by 12.7 MMDth to 124.5 MMDth, largely due to increased transportation sales.
Gas Distribution Operations
reported operating income of $69.1 million, a $21.7 million decrease from the same period in 2003 due to increased operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses in the third quarter 2004 is attributable to higher employee and administrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in pension expense. The comparable 2003 period benefited from the reversal of $11.0 million in accrued expenses for environmental remediation, the reversal of a franchise tax reserve and the receipt of insurance proceeds.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $95.4 million, an increase of $5.9 million from the comparable period last year. Net revenue increased primarily due to increased revenue from environmental trackers. On a comparative basis, lower revenues resulting from cooler weather in the current period were mostly offset by reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the third quarter of 2003. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2004 decreased primarily due to lower property taxes.
Electric Operations
The segment reported an operating loss of $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2004, versus an operating loss of $12.3 million in the third quarter of 2003. This improvement is the result of the settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and the effect of an accrual in the comparable period in 2003 for an unrelated lawsuit.
Other Operations
operating loss was $0.1 million versus operating income of $8.1 million for the third quarter 2003. The 2003 period was favorably impacted by a $16.2 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $100.0 million for the third quarter of 2004, a decrease of $13.6 million from the same period in 2003, due mainly to lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and a quarter-over-quarter reduction in debt balances. Other, net decreased by $0.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in the 2004 period. Income taxes for the third quarter of 2004 were $6.7 million versus $13.1 million for the third quarter 2003, mainly resulting from lower pre-tax income and the reversal of a $5.7 million tax reserve.

Nine-Month Period 2004 Operating Income
Operating income was $727.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, compared with $797.0 million for the same period in 2003. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, is discussed below.
operating income was $264.4 million, a decrease of $79.4 million versus the first nine months of 2003. The decrease in operating income was mainly attributable to lower net revenue as a result of warmer weather and lower non-traditional revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. Operating expenses increased for the first nine months of 2004 primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses largely offset by reduced bad debt expense, while the comparable 2003 period benefited from insurance refunds, insurance reserve adjustments, and a revised allocation methodology of corporate employee and administrative expenses. Gas Distribution Operations throughput for the period increased by 28.1 MMDth to 654.4 MMDth, largely due to increased off-system and transportation sales, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather during the first nine months of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003.
Gas Distribution Operations
reported operating income of $254.0 million, a $35.4 million decrease from the comparable 2003 period. Both the nine-months ended September 30, 2004 and the comparable 2003 period reflect lower interruptible transmission service revenues than those that have been historically realized. Management has evaluated operational issues and market conditions and anticipates that there will be fewer opportunities for interruptible revenue on an ongoing basis. Operating expenses increased as a result of higher employee and administrative expenses in the nine months ending September 30, 2004 primarily due to an increase in pension expense. The comparable 2003 period benefited from the reversal of an accrual for environmental remediation and the reversal of a legal reserve.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $236.2 million, an increase of $30.0 million from the comparable period last year primarily from higher net revenues from environmental trackers, increased customer usage and the effect of regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable weather for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Operating expenses decreased due to the reduction of an accrual for estimated property tax expense.
Electric Operations
The segment reported an operating loss of $27.2 million in the first nine months of 2004, versus an operating loss of $36.6 million in the first nine months of 2003. The decrease in the operating loss is primarily the result of the reversal of a litigation reserve due to the settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter 2004 and the accrual of litigation reserves for two unrelated issues in the comparable 2003 period.
Other Operations
 
NiSource reports third-quarter earnings Page 5
operating income was $0.5 million, an improvement of $6.3 million from the comparable 2003 period. The improvement was due to a change in the allocation methodology of corporate costs in 2003 that led to higher employee and administrative expenses in the corporate segment, offset by lower employee and administrative expenses in the other segments for the 2003 period. The 2004 period was favorably impacted by a litigation settlement while the comparable 2003 period benefited from the reversal of a litigation reserve and a $16.2 million gain on the sale of Columbia Service Partners, Inc.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $302.3 million for the first nine months of 2004 compared to $351.5 million for the first nine months of last year, a decrease of $49.2 million due mainly to lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and a year-over-year reduction in long-term debt and short term debt balances. Other, net decreased by $7.0 million as a result of decreased interest income in the 2004 period. Income taxes for the first nine months of 2004 were $154.4 million, a $12.5 million decrease from 2003, due to lower pre-tax income and the reversal of a tax reserve.
