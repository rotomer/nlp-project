EXHIBIT INDEX

 
NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported improved income from continuing operations in 2004, despite the impact of unfavorable weather on the company's natural gas and electric utility businesses.
MERRILLVILLE, Ind. 
"In 2004, we continued to hold the line on operation and maintenance costs, strengthened our balance sheet and lowered interest expense," stated Gary L. Neale, NiSource chairman and chief executive officer. "These positive efforts largely offset the adverse impact of weather on our natural gas and electric distribution businesses. Weather in our gas markets was somewhat warmer than normal overall during the year, while the summer was significantly cooler than normal in our northern Indiana electric market.
"Our strong, balanced portfolio of utility and pipeline assets continues to deliver solid performance, resulting in full-year earnings above the revised guidance we had set in October 2004," Neale added.
Income from continuing operations for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, was $430.2 million, or $1.63 per share (all per share amounts are basic), compared with $425.7 million, or $1.64 per share, in 2003.

There were 4.1 million more average shares outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004, compared with the end of 2003. The increase was primarily due to the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2004 of 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource's Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities (SAILS), and the issuance during the first quarter of 2003 of 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES.

Net income for 2004 was $436.3 million, or $1.65 per share, compared with $85.2 million, or 33 cents per share, in 2003. NiSource recognized losses associated with discontinued operations during the 2003 period.
Operating income was $1,072.0 million in 2004, compared with $1,116.3 million in 2003. Operating expenses were $1,983.7 million in 2004, compared with $1,944.0 million in 2003. Significant items that impacted the respective years were as follows:
Excluding the above items, operation and maintenance expenses declined when comparing the two periods. Operating income and total operating expenses were relatively flat.
Neale noted that interest expense was $60.8 million lower for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2004, compared with 2003. "We continued to strengthen the balance sheet in 2004, reducing total debt by more than $350 million," he said. "At the end of 2004, our debt ratio stood at 57 percent, down from over 60 percent at the end of 2003."

NiSource President Robert C. Skaggs, Jr., said accomplishments during 2004 included the implementation of regulatory and commercial strategies in key states that benefit both customers and shareholders, such as the renewal of Customer CHOICE in Ohio. Also, the NiSource pipelines completed the renegotiation of long-term contracts with their largest customers and made notable progress with several major transmission, storage and access expansion initiatives.

"The regulated revenue and commercial strategies that we initiated in 2003 have begun to yield returns, while customer growth and the improving economy contributed to increased throughput in our natural gas business and increased electric sales to our industrial customers during 2004," Skaggs said. "Our pipelines are focused on new expansion and storage projects to bring additional natural gas supplies to key markets. These important developments provide NiSource with a strong platform for longer-term, sustainable growth."
For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2004, income from continuing operations was $156.9 million, or 59 cents per share, compared with $140.6 million, or 54 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier. The company reported net income of $159.4 million, or 60 cents per share, for the 2004 period, compared with net income of $139.8 million, or 54 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2003.
NiSource will host an analyst meeting in New York, with a conference call available to financial analysts, at 12:30 p.m. EST on Friday, Feb. 4, to further discuss the company's 2004 results, outlook for 2005 and initiatives that will lead into 2006.

Fourth Quarter 2004 Operating Income
NiSource's consolidated fourth quarter 2004 operating income was $344.1 million compared with $319.3 million for the comparable period in 2003. This $24.8 million increase in operating income was due to higher net revenues from regulatory initiatives and increased customer usage. The impact of regulatory initiatives, which drove increases in net revenues during the current period, were partially offset by the implementation of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio that decreased operating expenses during the comparable period last year. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2004, is discussed below.
operations reported operating income of $175.9 million, an increase of $13.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase was mainly attributable to higher net revenues and lower employee and administrative expenses. Higher net revenues resulting from the Columbia Gas of Ohio stipulation agreement and increased usage were partially offset by higher operating expenses due to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by approval of a bad debt tracker for Columbia Gas of Ohio that allowed for the recovery of previously uncollected accounts receivable.
Gas Distribution
operations reported operating income of $109.1 million, approximately the same with a year ago. A decrease in net revenues was offset with lower operating expenses. The decrease in net revenues was primarily attributable to the restructuring of firm transportation and storage service contracts, which expired on Oct. 31, 2004. These contracts represent approximately 60 percent of the Transmission Segment's net annual revenues. The reduction to net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the restructuring of these contracts was $5.8 million. Going forward, the segment expects annual revenues from these contracts to be reduced by approximately $40 million, which represents approximately 5 percent of total segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts.
Gas Transmission and Storage
operations reported operating income of $70.0 million, an increase of $8.7 million from the comparable period last year primarily resulting from higher net revenues from the environmental tracker, increased industrial usage, and lower property tax accruals, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses.
Electric
The segment reported an operating loss of $5.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $7.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2003. The decreased loss resulted primarily from lower net costs to run the Whiting Clean Energy facility. The quarter ended Dec. 31, 2004 was also favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. The comparable period last year was favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of NiSource's interest in Mid-Tex Gas Storage and a reversal of a litigation reserve.
Other
reported an operating loss of $5.8 million, a $1.1 million reduction in loss from the comparable 2003 period, driven by lower employee and administrative expenses.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $101.6 million for the quarter, a decrease of $11.6 million from the same period in 2003, due to a quarter-over-quarter reduction in long-term debt and short-term borrowings and lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity. Other, net decreased by $0.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in the 2004 period. Income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $86.5 million, a $19.2 million increase from 2003 mainly resulting from higher pre-tax income.

Twelve-Month Period Operating Income
NiSource's consolidated operating income was $1,072.0 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2004, compared with $1,116.3 million for the same period in 2003, a decrease of $44.3 million. Net revenue was down slightly from the prior year as decreased sales and deliveries of electricity and natural gas resulting from unfavorable weather impacts versus last year were mostly offset with higher revenues from increased industrial usage, additional residential and commercial customers, rate refunds that reduced 2003 revenues, and regulatory initiatives that improved 2004 net revenue. These regulatory efforts included the environmental tracker in Indiana and the Columbia Gas of Ohio stipulation agreement. Operating expenses for 2004 were $39.7 million higher than 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by the $16.6 million gain on sale of Columbia Service Partners (CSP), insurance recoveries and the reversal of environmental and other accruals. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts from the prior year were reductions in property tax accruals during 2004. NiSource's business segment operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, is discussed below.
operating income was $440.3 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2004, a decrease of $66.1 million from the prior year. Net revenues decreased by $36.0 million, primarily as the result of warmer weather and lower non-traditional revenues partially offset by increased industrial and customer usage and the recognition of revenues from the Columbia Gas of Ohio stipulation agreement. Operating expenses during 2004 were $30.1 million higher than 2003 due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by insurance recoveries, accrual adjustments, and a revised allocation methodology of corporate employee and administrative expenses. Both periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for Columbia of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003. Gas Distribution Operations throughput for the period increased by 22.3 MMDth to 898.5 MMDth, largely due to increased off system, industrial and transportation volumes, partially offset by reduced residential and commercial volumes as a result of warmer weather during year ended December 31, 2004, compared with the prior year.
Gas Distribution Operations
reported operating income of $363.1 million, a $35.7 million decrease from the comparable 2003 period. Operating expenses for 2004 increased by $31.0 million due primarily to the comparable 2003 period being favorably impacted by the reversal of an accrual for environmental remediation and the reversal of a legal accrual. Higher pension expenses during 2004 also added to the increase. Both years reflect lower interruptible transmission service revenues than those that have been historically realized. Management has evaluated operational issues and market conditions and anticipates that there will be fewer opportunities for interruptible revenue on an ongoing basis. In addition net revenues will continue to be impacted by the restructuring of firm transportation and storage service contracts, which had expired on Oct. 31, 2004. These contracts represent approximately 60 percent of the Transmission Segment's net annual revenues. Going forward, the segment expects annual revenues from these contracts to be reduced by approximately $40 million, which represents approximately 5 percent of total segment revenues. This reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts.

operations reported operating income of $306.2 million, an increase of $38.7 million from the comparable period last year primarily from higher net revenues from environmental trackers and increased industrial usage, and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable weather during 2004. Operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million due to the reduction of property tax accruals partially offset by reserve adjustments that lowered 2003 expenses, debt reacquisition costs, and higher administrative charges and fees associated with the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO). Electric Operations sold 17,367.5 gwh for the year, a decrease of 1,071.7 gwh from last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter partially offset by increased sales to industrial and commercial customers.
Electric
The segment reported an operating loss of $32.3 million, versus an operating loss of $43.8 million in the 2003 period. The lower operating loss resulted from reduced employee and administrative expenses and a $5.1 million legal settlement. In addition, both periods included losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy.
Other
reported an operating loss of $5.3 million, an improvement of $7.3 million from the comparable 2003 period. The improvement was due largely to lower employee, administrative and other operation and maintenance expenses.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense was $403.9 million for the twelve month period ended Dec. 31, 2004, compared to $464.7 million for the 12 months of 2003, a decrease of $60.8 million due mainly to lower long-term interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and a year-over-year reduction in long-term debt and short term borrowings. Other, net decreased by $7.9 million as a result of decreased interest income in 2004. Income taxes for the twelve months of 2004 were $240.9 million, a $6.7 million increase from 2003, mainly resulting from higher pre-tax income.
Basic average shares of common stock outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004 were 263.7 million compared to 259.6 million at Dec. 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2004 of 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource's Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities (SAILS) and the issuance during the first quarter of 2003 of 13.1 million shares of common stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a component of the Corporate PIES.
