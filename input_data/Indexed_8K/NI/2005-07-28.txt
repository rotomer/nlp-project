NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI) today reported income from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2005, of $7.9 million, or 3 cents per share (all per-share amounts are basic), compared with income from continuing operations of $35.5 million, or 13 cents per share, for the second quarter of 2004.
MERRILLVILLE, Ind. 
The quarterly results reflect the impact of $31.2 million, or 7 cents per share, of charges NiSource recorded during the second quarter of 2005 for restructuring expenses, consulting fees and obsolete software systems in connection with the outsourcing agreement with IBM and other business transformation activities. In addition, second-quarter 2005 results include a $10.9 million, or 4 cents per share, impairment charge related to goodwill at one of NiSource's small Indiana distribution companies, which is currently under an earnings cap.
NiSource expects additional charges in connection with the outsourcing agreement with IBM and other business transformation activities during the second half of 2005 to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million. These charges include non-cash pension and other retirement benefit costs and IBM transition fees.

Net income was $39.0 million, or 15 cents per share, for the second quarter of 2005. This compares to net income of $34.6 million, or 13 cents per share, for the year-ago period. The 2005 results included $31.1 million of income from discontinued operations.
Operating income was $119.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $157.8 million for the same period in 2004. Significant items that affected the respective quarters were as follows:
"Operating results from our core utility and pipeline assets remain solid," said Robert C. Skaggs, Jr., NiSource President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Skaggs assumed the CEO role effective July 1, 2005, upon the retirement of Gary L. Neale, who remains Chairman of the Board.
"We have said since the beginning of 2005 that this will be a base year, from which we will build a platform for long-term, sustainable growth," Skaggs added. "We continue to resolve issues and to demonstrate steady progress on our business plan, which is focused on four elements: growth in our pipeline business; regulatory and commercial initiatives; management of our balance sheet and expense management."
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, NiSource reported income from continuing operations of $216.6 million, or 80 cents per share, compared with $252.3 million, or 96 cents per share, in the same period of 2004. Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $245.3 million, or 91 cents per share, compared with $248.1 million, or 95 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.

The six-months results for 2005 include the same restructuring and other charges outlined in the second-quarter discussion.
One cent of the decline in earnings per share for the quarter, and 3 cents of the decline in the six-month results, were the result of an increase in the average number of shares outstanding at June 30, 2005, compared to the year earlier, primarily due to the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2004 of 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource's Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities (SAILS).

Skaggs noted that recent developments include the following:

Second Quarter 2005 Operating Income
NiSource's consolidated second quarter 2005 operating income was $119.4 million compared with $157.8 million for the same period in 2004. Second quarter 2005 results include $31.2 million of restructuring expenses, consulting fees, and charges for obsolete software systems recorded in connection with the outsourcing agreement with IBM and other business transformation activities. In addition, second-quarter 2005 results include a $10.9 million impairment charge related to goodwill at one of NiSource's small Indiana distribution companies, which is currently under an earnings cap. Second quarter 2004 results included a $16.7 million net reduction in property and sales tax accruals.
The 2005 restructuring, consulting, and obsolete software system charges of $31.2 million included severance expenses of $16.4 million, consulting fees of $3.9 million, and an impairment of obsolete software systems of $10.9 million. The breakout of these costs by business segment is Gas Distribution Operations $11.2 million, Gas Transmission and Storage Operations $2.7 million, Electric Operations $1.8 million, Other Operations $0.2 million, and Corporate $15.3 million. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, is discussed below.
reported operating income of $5.7 million versus operating income of $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impact of restructuring expenses and a $10.9 million impairment charge taken against goodwill associated with Kokomo Gas and Fuel Company partially offset by cooler weather during the beginning of the second quarter of 2005 and lower sales tax accruals compared to the prior period.
Gas Distribution Operations
Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results was impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. These trackers increase both operating expenses and net revenues and have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Approximately $7.7 million of the increase in operation and maintenance expenses and other taxes was offset by the effect of these regulatory trackers with a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs. Additionally, the expiration of the 1999 stipulation for Columbia Gas of Ohio resulted in the recognition of additional revenue offset by an increase in depreciation expense.
reported operating income of $76.8 million, an increase of $3.3 million versus the second quarter of 2004. This increase in operating income resulted from an $8.9 million third-party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper's long-term contract partially offset by continued lower revenues due to pipeline recontracting, net of remarketing activities, and the impact of restructuring charges.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $61.0 million, a decrease of $21.0 million from the comparable period last year. This reduction in operating income was primarily due to a 2004 property tax accrual reduction of $18.1 million, the impact of restructuring charges, incremental Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) cost of $5.6 million, and increased electric production expenses of $3.0 million partially offset by favorable weather due to the warm weather in June of 2005.
Electric Operations
The reported an operating loss of $8.9 million in 2005, versus an operating loss of $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2004 primarily reflecting higher property tax accruals and the impact of restructuring charges partially offset by decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy.
Other Operations

reported an operating loss of $15.2 million compared to an operating loss of $5.0 million during the second quarter of 2004. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to the $10.9 million impairment charge for obsolete enterprise software systems and the impact of restructuring and consulting charges associated with the IBM agreement.
Corporate
Other Items
Interest expense increased by $2.6 million due to higher short-term interest rates. Other, net increased $3.5 million primarily the result of higher interest income. Income tax expense of $12.3 million represented a 60.9% effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2005. This resulted because no tax benefit was recorded for the goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for tax purposes.
Discontinued Operations income of $31.1 million was the result of changes to reserves for contingencies related to the previous sale of discontinued assets and the impairment of discontinued assets.
Six-Month Period 2005 Operating Income
Operating income was $557.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, compared with $600.9 million for the same period in 2004. Operating income for NiSource's business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2005, is discussed below.
operating income was $280.6 million, a decrease of $19.5 million versus the first half of 2004. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the restructuring and the goodwill impairment charges recorded during the second quarter of 2005.
Gas Distribution Operations'
Comparability of Gas Distribution Operations line item operating results was impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses. These trackers increase both operating expenses and net revenues and have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Approximately $26.5 million of the increase in operation and maintenance expenses and other taxes was offset by the effect of the regulatory trackers with a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of certain costs. Additionally, the expiration of the 1999 stipulation for Columbia Gas of Ohio resulted in the recognition of additional revenues with a partial offset from increased depreciation expense.
reported operating income of $186.3 million, a $1.4 million increase from the comparable 2004 period. The increase was primarily due to an $8.9 million third-party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper's long-term contract and lower operation and maintenance expenses partially offset by approximately $11.0 million reduction of net revenues from pipeline recontracting, net of remarketing activities, and the impact of restructuring charges.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
reported operating income of $126.4 million, a decrease of $14.4 million from the comparable period last year. This reduction in operating income was primarily due to a 2004 property tax accrual reduction of $18.1 million, incremental MISO cost of $6.3 million, higher electric production expenses of $5.4 million, and the impact of restructuring charges partially offset by the environmental tracker and favorable weather.

The segment reported an operating loss of $14.1 million in the first half of 2005, versus an operating loss of $25.5 million in the first half of 2004, mainly due to decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and higher commercial and industrial gas marketing net revenues partially offset by higher property tax accruals and the impact of restructuring charges.         .
Other Operations
reported an operating loss of $22.1 compared to operating income of $0.6 million during the first half of 2004. The operating loss recorded this year is primarily due to the $10.9 million impairment charge for obsolete enterprise software systems and the impact from restructuring and consulting charges that were recorded during the second quarter 2005. Last year results include a legal settlement that increased operating income by $14.3 million.
Corporate
Interest expense was $205.7 million for the first six months of 2005 compared to $201.3 million for the first six months of last year. This increase was due to higher short-term interest rates. Income taxes for the first six months of 2005 were $135.7 million, a $12.3 million decrease from 2004 mainly resulting from lower pre-tax income.
Other Items
Basic average shares of common stock outstanding at June 30, 2005 were 270.8 million compared to 262.4 million at June 30, 2004. The increase was primarily due to the issuance during the fourth quarter of 2004 of 6.8 million shares of common stock upon the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of NiSource's Stock Appreciation Income Linked Securities (SAILS). The increase in average shares outstanding caused a $0.03 dilution of earnings-per-share during the first six months of 2005.
