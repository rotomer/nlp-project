At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders on May 10, 2006, the stockholders of the Company approved the declassification of the Company's board of directors, as described in Item 5.03 of this current report on Form 8-K. On May 10, 2006, consistent with the declassification proposal approved by the stockholders of the Company, each director whose term would not otherwise have expired at the 2007 annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company tendered his resignation effective as of the 2007 annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company. The directors submitting their resignations were Peter McCausland, Steven R. McCracken, Gary L. Neale, Ian M. Rolland, Robert C. Skaggs, Jr., Robert J. Welsh, and Roger A. Young.
A copy of the press release announcing the tender of resignation by each of the above directors is attached hereto as exhibit 99.1.
Consistent with the declassification proposal approved by the stockholders of the Company on May 10, 2006, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws to provide for a declassified board structure and the annual election of directors. Beginning with the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2007, each director will be elected annually to serve until the following annual meeting and the election and qualification of his or her successor. Prior to these amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws, the Company's directors were divided into three classes, and the directors in each class were elected to three-year terms. The amendments were effective as of May 12, 2006.
Further details regarding the amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws can be found in the definitive proxy statement filed by the Company on April 3, 2006.

EXHIBIT INDEX

 
Exhibit 3.1
 
     The name of this Corporation is NiSource Inc.
     The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is located at Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle. The name of its registered agent is Corporation Service Company, and the address of said registered agent is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, in said city.
     The nature of the business to be conducted and the purposes of the Corporation are to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended.
     The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is Four hundred twenty million (420,000,000), of which Twenty million (20,000,000) shares of the par value $.01 each are to be of a class designated Preferred Stock and Four hundred million (400,000,000) shares of the par value of $.01 each are to be of a class designated Common Stock.
     1. Subject to the powers, preferences and other special rights afforded Preferred Stock by the provisions of this Article IV or resolutions adopted pursuant hereto, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by Delaware law, such dividends as may from time to time be declared by the Board of Directors.
     2. Except as otherwise required by Delaware law and as otherwise provided in this Article IV and resolutions adopted pursuant hereto with respect to Preferred Stock, and subject to the provisions of the Bylaws of the Corporation, as from time to time amended, with respect to
 
the closing of the transfer books and the fixing of a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess voting power for the election of directors and for all other purposes, and the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no voting power and shall not be entitled to any notice of any meeting of stockholders.
     3. Except as may otherwise be required by law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the provisions of the resolution or resolutions as may be adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Article IV with respect to Preferred Stock, each holder of Common Stock, and each holder of Preferred Stock, if entitled to vote on such matter, shall be entitled to one vote in respect of each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, held by such holder on each matter voted upon by stockholders, and any such right to vote shall not be cumulative.
     4. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption).
     5. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of the Corporation, after distribution in full of the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of Preferred Stock, as set forth in this Article IV or the resolutions adopted with respect to such series under this Article IV, holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Corporation of whatever kind available for distribution to the stockholders ratably and in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them respectively. The Board of Directors may distribute in kind to the holders of Common Stock such remaining assets of the Corporation or may sell, transfer, otherwise dispose of all or any part of such remaining assets to any other corporation, trust or other entity and receive payment therefor in cash, stock or obligations of such other corporation, trust or other entity, or a combination thereof, and may set all or make any part of the consideration so received and distributed or any balance thereof in kind to holders of Common Stock. The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or any purchase or redemption of shares of stock of the Corporation of any class, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation, or winding-up of the Corporation for the purposes of this Article IV.
     The express grant of authority to the Board of Directors of the Corporation to fix by resolution or resolutions the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of Preferred Stock that are not fixed by this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is as follows:
     1. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in any amount, not exceeding in the aggregate the total number of shares of Preferred Stock herein above authorized, reduced by the number of shares of Preferred Stock designated under Section C of this Article IV, as Preferred Stock of one or more series, as hereinafter provided. All shares of any one series of
 
Preferred Stock shall be alike in every particular, each series thereof shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words, and all series of Preferred Stock shall rank equally and be identical in all respects except as permitted by the provisions of Subsection B.2 of this Article IV.
     2. Authority is hereby expressly granted to and vested in the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock as Preferred Stock of any series and in connection with the creation of each such series to fix, by the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of shares thereof, the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, of such series, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the foregoing general authority vested in the Board of Directors, but not in limitation of the powers conferred on the Board of Directors thereby and by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to determine with respect to each series of Preferred Stock other than the series designated under Section C of this Article IV:
 
of stock of the Corporation shall be subject to restrictions and, if so, the nature thereof;
in each case, so far as not inconsistent with the provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Delaware General Corporation Law then in effect.
     The designation and number of shares, and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of a series of Preferred Stock are fixed by this Section C of ARTICLE IV as follows:
     1. . The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 4,000,000.
Designation and Amount
     2. .
Dividends and Distributions
     (a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar shares) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock and of any other junior shares, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 20th day of February, May, August and November in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $26 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the
 
first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share of Series A Preferred Stock or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph 2(a) of this Section C immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $26 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
     (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
     3. . The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
 
     (a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in any resolution creating a series of Preferred Stock or by law, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
     (c) If at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors a "default in preference dividends" on the Series A Preferred Stock shall exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two (2), and the holders of the Preferred Stock of all series (whether or not the holders of such series of Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in preference dividends did not exist) shall have the right at such meeting, voting together as a single class without regard to series, to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two (2) directors of the Corporation to fill such newly created directorships. Such right shall continue until there are no dividends in arrears upon the Preferred Stock. Each director elected by the holders of Preferred Stock (a "Preferred Director") shall continue to serve as such director for the full term for which he shall have been elected, notwithstanding that prior to the end of such term a default in preference dividends shall cease to exist. Any Preferred Director may be removed by, and shall not be removed except by, the vote of the holders of record of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a single class without regard to series, at a meeting of the stockholders or of the holders of Preferred Stock called for the purpose. So long as a default in any preference dividends on the Preferred Stock shall exist, (i) any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director may be filled (except as provided in the following clause (ii)) by an instrument in writing signed by the remaining Preferred Director and filed with the Corporation and (ii) in the case of the removal of any Preferred Director, the vacancy may be filled by the vote of the holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock voting together as a single class without regard to series, at the same meeting at which such removal shall be voted. Each director appointed as
 
aforesaid by the remaining Preferred Director shall be deemed, for all purposes hereof, to be a Preferred Director. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Directors shall end and a default in preference dividends shall no longer exist, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be reduced by two (2). For the purposes hereof, a "default in preference dividends" on the Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have occurred whenever the amount of accrued dividends upon any series of the Preferred Stock shall be equivalent to six (6) full quarterly dividends or more, and, having so occurred, such default shall be deemed to exist thereafter until, but only until, all accrued dividends on all Preferred Stock of each and every series then outstanding shall have been paid to the end of the last preceding quarterly dividend period.
     (d) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
     4. .
Certain Restrictions
     (a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock, as provided in paragraph 2 of this Section C, are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
     (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
     (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity shares on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
     (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior shares in exchange for any shares of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
     (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made
 
in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such stock upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
     (b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph 4(a) of this Section C, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
     5. . Any Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and, upon the filing of any certificate that may be required by Delaware law, canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in this Article IV or any resolution providing for the creation of any series of Preferred Stock adopted pursuant thereto or as otherwise required by law.
Reacquired Shares
     6. . Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (a) to the holders of shares ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $6,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (b) to the holders of shares ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity shares in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (a) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
     7.  In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other shares or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment
Consolidation, Merger, etc.
 
hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of shares, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     8. . The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
No Redemption
     9. . The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be convertible into Common Stock or shares of any other series of any other class of Preferred Stock.
Conversion
     10. . The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of Preferred Stock, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
Rank
     11. . This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.
Amendment
     1. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than nine (9) or more than twelve (12) persons, the exact number to be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption), provided, however, this provision shall not act to limit Board size in the event the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock are entitled to elect directors to the exclusion of holders of Common Stock. Each director who is serving as a director on the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders following such date and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, notwithstanding that such director may have been elected for a term that extended beyond the date of such next annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation after the date of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, directors elected at such annual meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
     2. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise provided by law, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock shall have the right (to the exclusion of
 
holders of Common Stock) to elect directors of the Corporation pursuant to the provisions of Article IV or any resolution adopted pursuant thereto, the election of such directors of the Corporation shall be governed by the terms and provisions of Article IV or said resolutions and such directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the first year following their election or, if such right of the holders of the Preferred Stock is terminated, for a term expiring in accordance with the provisions of Article IV or such resolutions.
     3. Newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, acting at a regular or special meeting. If any applicable provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Article IV or any resolution adopted pursuant to Article IV expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such a meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the combined voting powers of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally; provided, however, that when (a) pursuant to the provisions of Article IV or any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, the holders of any series of Preferred Stock have the right (to the exclusion of holders of the Common Stock), and have exercised such right, to elect directors and (b) Delaware General Corporation Law, Article IV or any such resolution expressly confers on stockholders voting rights as aforesaid, if the directorship to be filled had been occupied by a director elected by the holders of Common Stock, then such directorship shall be filled by an 80 percent vote as aforesaid, but if such directorship to be filled had been elected by holders of Preferred Stock, then such directorship shall be filled in accordance with Article IV or the applicable resolutions adopted under Article IV. Any director elected in accordance with the two preceding sentences shall hold office until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified unless such director was elected by holders of Preferred Stock (acting to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock), in which case such director's term shall expire in accordance with Article IV or the applicable resolutions adopted pursuant to Article IV. No decrease in the number of authorized directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director, except as otherwise provided in Article IV or the applicable resolutions adopted pursuant to Article IV with respect to directorships created pursuant to one or more series of Preferred Stock.
     4. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director or directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the combined voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally, voting together as a single class (it being understood that for all purposes of this Article V, each share of Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, if any, granted to it pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution adopted pursuant to Article IV).
     5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the stock of the Corporation required by law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any resolution adopted pursuant to Article IV, the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
 
directorships at the time any such alteration, amendment or repeal is presented to the Board for adoption), shall be required to alter, amend or repeal this Article V, or any provision hereof.
     1. . To the fullest extent that the Delaware General Corporation Law as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended permits the limitation or elimination of the personal liability of directors, no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to or repeal of this Section B.1 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
Limitation on Liability
     2. . The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect indemnify any person (the Indemnitee) who was or is involved in any manner (including, without limitation, as a party or a witness) or is threatened to be made so involved in any threatened, pending or completed investigation, claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) (a "Proceeding") by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or of NiSource Corporate Services Company or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including, without limitation, any employee benefit plan) against all expenses including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such Proceeding. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall include the right to receive payment of any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition, consistent with the provisions of applicable law as then in effect.
Right to Indemnification
     3. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Indemnitee against any expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement as specified in Subsection B.2 of this Section B or incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding referred to in Subsection B.2 of this Section B, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect. The Corporation may enter into contracts with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Section B and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section B.
Insurance, Contracts and Funding
     4. . The right of indemnification provided in this Section B shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled, and the provisions of this Section B shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of any person entitled to indemnity under this Section B and shall be applicable to Proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this Section B, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption.
Indemnification; No Exclusive Right
     5. . In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this Section B:
Advancement of Expenses; Procedures; Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings; Remedies
 
     (a) . All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding shall be advanced to the Indemnitee by the Corporation within twenty (20) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this Section B.
Advancement of Expenses
     (b) Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.
     (i) To obtain indemnification under this Section B, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "Supporting Documentation"). The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
     (ii) The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Section B shall be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even if they constitute less than a quorum of the Board; (B) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (x) a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and the Indemnitee so requests or (y) there are no Disinterested Directors or a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (C) by the stockholders of the Corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (D) as provided in Section B.5(c).
     (iii) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section B.5(b)(ii), a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel (except that if there are no Disinterested Directors, the Corporation's General Counsel shall select the Independent Counsel), but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Board of Directors does not reasonably object.
     (iv) The only basis upon which a finding of no entitlement to indemnification may be made is that indemnification is prohibited by law.
     (c) . Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section B, if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
 
Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section B upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Section B.5(b)(i), and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under Section B.5(b) to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any Proceeding described in Section B.2, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.
     (d) .
Remedies of Indemnitee
     (i) In the event that a determination is made, pursuant to Section B.5(b) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Section B, (A) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of his entitlement to such indemnification either, at the Indemnitee's sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (B) any such judicial Proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (C) in any such judicial Proceeding or arbitration the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Section B.
     (ii) If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to Section B.5(b) or (c), that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five (5) days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (A) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that (x) advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section B.5(a) or (y) payment of indemnification is not made within five (5) days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Section B.5(b) or (c), the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the Corporation's obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the
 
occurrence of an event described in subclause (A) or (B) of this clause (ii) (a "Disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event.
     (iii) The Corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial Proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section B.5(d) that the procedures and preemptions of this Section B are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Section B.
     (iv) In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section B.5(d), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Section B, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly.
     (e) . For purposes of this Section B.5:
Definitions
     (i) "Change in Control" means (A) so long as the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is in effect, any "company" becoming a "holding company in respect to the Corporation or any determination by the Securities and Exchange Commission that any "person" should be subject to the obligations, duties, and liabilities if imposed by said Act by virtue of his, hers or its influence over the management or policies of the Corporation, or (B) whether or not said Act is in effect a change in control of the Corporation of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), whether or not the Corporation is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing ten percent or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities without the prior approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such acquisition; (ii) the Corporation is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other reorganization, or a proxy contest, as a consequence of which members of the Board of Directors in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board of Directors thereafter; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors (including for this purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors
 
at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors.
     (ii) "Disinterested Director" means a director of the Corporation who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the Indemnitee.
     (iii) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm or a member of a law firm that neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (A) the Corporation or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (B) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Section B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing under Delaware law, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights under this Section B.
     6. . If any provision or provisions of this Section B shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provision of this Section B (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Section B containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Section B (including, without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Section B containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability
     7. . Reference herein to laws, regulations or agencies shall be deemed to include all amendments thereof, substitutions therefor and successors thereto.
Successor Laws, Regulations and Agencies
The Board of Directors shall have the power to make, alter, amend and repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation in such form and with such terms as the Board may determine, subject to the power granted to stockholders to alter or repeal the Bylaws provided under Delaware law; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such alteration, amendment or repeal is presented to the Board for adoption), shall be required to alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws which is to the same effect as any one or more sections of this Article VI.
 
Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation, through its Board of Directors, reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, alter, repeal or rescind any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the manner now or hereinafter prescribed by law, and any other provisions authorized by Delaware law at the time enforced may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereinafter prescribed by law, and any and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereinafter amended are granted subject to the rights reserved in this Article.

 
Exhibit 3.2
 
     The corporate seal of the Corporation shall consist of a metallic stamp circular in form, bearing in its center the figures "2000" and the words "Incorporated" and "Delaware" and on the outer edge the name of the Corporation.
     The location of the Corporation's principal office shall be at 801 East 86th Avenue, in the Town of Merrillville, County of Lake, in the State of Indiana.
     The Corporation may, in addition to its principal office in the State of Indiana, establish and maintain an office or offices in such other states and places as the Board of Directors may from time to time find necessary or desirable.
     The books, documents, and papers of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise required by the laws of the State of Delaware, may be kept outside of the said State at such places as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.
     Every stockholder shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman, the President or a Vice President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation; provided, however, that any such signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer or officers, Transfer Agent or Registrar who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation, Transfer Agent or Registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not
 
ceased to be such officer or officers of the Corporation, Transfer Agent or Registrar. Such certificates shall be transferable on the stock books of the Corporation in person or by attorney, but, except as hereinafter provided in the case of loss, destruction or mutilation of certificates, no transfer of stock shall be entered until the previous certificate, if any, given for the same shall have been surrendered and canceled.
     The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation.
     The Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-Laws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of the capital stock of the Corporation. It may appoint one or more Transfer Agents or one or more Registrars or both, and may require all certificates of stock to bear the signature of either or both.
     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. If in any case involving the determination of stockholders for any purpose other than notice of or voting at a meeting of stockholders the Board shall not fix such a record date, the record date for determining stockholders for such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of stockholders, shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
     In case of loss, destruction or mutilation of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place upon proof of such loss, destruction or mutilation and upon the giving to the Corporation of a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation, its Transfer Agents and Registrars, against any claim that may be made against it or them on account of the alleged loss or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate; provided, however, that a new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, it is proper so to do.
     (a) All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors shall determine. The place at which any given meeting shall be held shall be distinctly specified in the notice of such meeting.
     (b) The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting, shall be held on the second Tuesday in May of each year, at ten o'clock in the morning, unless such day shall fall on a legal holiday, in which event the annual meeting shall be held on the day following. Such date and time of meeting may be changed by action of the Board of Directors.
 
     (c) Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption)
     (d) If the annual meeting of the stockholders is not held as herein prescribed, the election of Directors may be held at any meeting thereafter called pursuant to these By-Laws.
     (e) Notice of the annual and of all special meetings of the stockholders shall be given each holder of stock of the Corporation having power to vote at such meeting by depositing in the United States mail a written or printed notice of the same not less than ten nor more than sixty days prior to the meeting, with postage prepaid, to each such stockholder of record of the Corporation and addressed to him at his address as registered upon the books of the Corporation. Except in special cases where other provision is made by statute, no publication of any notice of a meeting of stockholders shall be required. Every notice of a meeting of stockholders shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy except a stockholder who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Except where otherwise required by statute for an adjournment exceeding thirty days or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall not be required to be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting which is adjourned.
     It shall be the duty of the officer who shall have charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing their addresses of record and the number of shares held by each. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the meeting is to be held at a place other than the Corporation's principal place of business, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
     (f) The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person, or represented by proxy, shall be requisite and shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of any business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If, however, such majority shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat present in person or by proxy shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time. At any such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
 
     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no proxy shall be valid after three years from the date of its execution, unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder as proxy pursuant to the foregoing sentence, a shareholder may validly grant such authority (i) by executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy or (ii) by authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic submission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or similar agency duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the submission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic submission must either contain or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic submission was transmitted by or authorized by the stockholder, or by any other method allowed under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
     (g) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.
     (h) At any annual or special meeting of stockholders, persons nominated for election as directors by stockholders and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders shall be entertained only if advance notice thereof has been timely given as provided herein and such proposals or nominations are otherwise proper for consideration under applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation. Notice of any proposal to be presented by any stockholder or of the name of any person to be nominated by any stockholder for election as a director of the Corporation at any meeting of stockholders shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at its principal executive office not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the meeting is first publicly announced or disclosed (in a public filing or otherwise) less than 100 days prior to the date of the meeting, such advance notice shall be given not more than ten days after such date is first so announced or disclosed. Public notice shall be deemed to have been given more than 100 days in advance of the annual meeting if the Corporation shall have previously disclosed, in these By-Laws or otherwise, that the annual meeting in each year is to be held on a determinable date, unless and until the Board determines to hold the meeting on a different date. Any stockholder who gives notice of any such proposal shall deliver therewith the text of the proposal to be presented and a brief written statement of the reasons why such stockholder favors the proposal and setting forth such stockholder's name and address, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in the proposal (other than as a stockholder). Any stockholder desiring to nominate any person for election as a director of the Corporation shall deliver with such notice a statement in writing setting forth the name of the person to be nominated, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such person, the information regarding such person required by paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation SK adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (or the corresponding provisions of any regulation subsequently adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to the Corporation), such person's signed consent to serve as a director of the Corporation if elected, such stockholder's name and address and the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such stockholder. As used herein, shares "beneficially owned" shall mean all shares as
 
to which such person, together with such person's affiliates and associates (as defined in Rule 12b2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), may be deemed to beneficially own pursuant to Rules 13d3 and 13d5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as all shares as to which such person, together with such person's affiliates and associates, has the right to become the beneficial owner pursuant to any agreement or understanding, or upon the exercise of warrants, options or rights to convert or exchange (whether such rights are exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time or the occurrence of conditions). The person presiding at the meeting, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall determine whether such notice has been duly given and shall direct that proposals and nominees not be considered if such notice has not been given.
     (a) The management of business and affairs of the Corporation shall be under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not less than nine (9) or more than twelve (12) persons, the exact number to be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time of any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption). Each director who is serving as a director immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders on May 10, 2006 shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders following such date and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, notwithstanding that such director may have been elected for a term that extended beyond the date of such next annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation after the annual meeting of stockholders on May 10, 2006, directors elected at such annual meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
     (b) Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therefor, and unless otherwise specified with respect thereto the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Subject to the rights of the holders of the Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the combined voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of stock of all classes and series of the Corporation entitled to vote generally (the "Voting Stock"), voting together as a single class (it being understood that, for all purposes of these By-Laws, each share of the Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes granted to it pursuant to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or any designation of terms of any class or series of Preferred Stock made pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation). The Corporation must notify the director of the grounds of his impending removal and the director shall have an opportunity, at the expense of the Corporation, to present his defense to the stockholders by a statement which accompanies or precedes the Corporation's solicitation of proxies to remove him. The term "entire Board" as used in these By-Laws means the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies.
     (c) Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause may be filled only by a majority
 
vote of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, acting at a regular or special meeting. If any applicable provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law expressly confers power on stockholders to fill such a directorship at a special meeting of stockholders, such a directorship may be filled at such a meeting only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of the Voting Stock of the Corporation; provided, however, that when (a) pursuant to the provisions of Article IV of the Certificate of Incorporation the holders of Preferred Stock have the right, and have exercised such right, to elect directors and (b) The Delaware General Corporation Law expressly confers on stockholders voting rights as aforesaid, if the directorship to be filled had been occupied by a director elected by holders of Common Stock, then such directorship shall be filled by an 80 percent vote as aforesaid, but if such directorship to be filled had been elected by holders of Preferred Stock, then such directorship shall be filled by the majority vote of the holders of Preferred Stock. Any director elected in accordance with the two preceding sentences shall hold office until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
     (d) Without prejudice to the general powers conferred by subdivision (a) of this Article, the Board of Directors shall have and exercise each and every power granted to them in Article VI of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.
     (e) Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such office or offices, whether within or without the State of Delaware, and at such times as the Board shall from time to time determine.
     Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman or, if both are incapacitated or unable to call such meetings, by any member of the Board of Directors. Such meetings may take place in the office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware or in such office or offices as the Directors may establish.
     (f) Except as aforesaid, notice of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be given to each Director by five days' service of the same by telegram, or telephone or letter or personally. Notice of any special meeting of the Board of Directors shall state the place and hour of the meeting, but need not state the purposes thereof. Notice of any meeting of the Board or of any Committee need not be given to any Director if waived by him in writing, or by telegraph or cable, whether before or after such meeting be held, or if he shall be present at the meeting; and any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any Committee shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given, if all the members shall be present thereat. Notice of regular meetings of the Board need not be given. In the absence of written instructions from a Director designating some other address, notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed to him at his usual business address.
     (g) Except as provided in clause (c) of this Article, a majority of the total number of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the Board of Directors; but less than a quorum may adjourn the meeting.
     (h) Each Director of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive such fixed sum per meeting of the Board of Directors attended, or such annual sum, or both, as the Board shall from time to time determine, together with his expenses of attendance at such meeting.
 
     (I) The Board of Directors may from time to time, but in no event less frequently than annually, elect from among its members a Chairman of the Board. The Chairman shall, if present, preside at all meetings of the stockholders and at all meetings of the Board of Directors. If the Chairman is not present, the Lead Director shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and the Board of Directors. The Chairman shall have such other responsibilities, and shall perform such duties, as may from time to time be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors.
     (j) The Chairman shall be responsible, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, for setting an agenda for each meeting of the Board of Directors.
     (a) The Board of Directors may from time to time, in its discretion, by resolution passed by a majority of the Board, designate, and appoint, from the directors committees of one or more persons which shall have and may exercise such lawfully delegable powers and duties conferred or authorized by the resolutions of designation and appointment. The Board of Directors shall have power at any time to change the members of any such committee, to fill vacancies, and to discharge any such committee.
     (b) Unless the Board of Directors shall provide otherwise, the presence of one-half of the total membership of any committee of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of such committee and the act of a majority of those present shall be necessary and sufficient for the taking of any action thereat.
     (a) The officers of the Corporation shall be the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Presidents of the Corporation's Business Segments, one or more Vice Presidents, the Secretary, and the Treasurer, who shall be elected by the Board of Directors, and may include the Controller, such additional Assistant Secretaries, Assistant Treasurers, and special subordinate officers as may from time to time be elected or appointed by the Board of Directors or appointed by the Chief Executive Officer.
     Any two of the above offices may be held by the same person except those of President and Secretary.
     The Chief Executive Officer or an officer designated by the Chief Executive Officer shall make a report on the state of the business of the Corporation at each annual meeting of stockholders.
     All of the officers of the Corporation shall hold office for one year and until others are elected or appointed and qualified in their stead, unless in the election or appointment of the officer it shall be specified that he holds his office for a shorter period or subject to the pleasure of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer.
 
     All vacancies in such offices by resignation, death or otherwise may be filled by the Board of Directors. In the case of absence or inability to act of any officer of the Corporation, and of any person herein authorized to act in his place, the Board of Directors may from time to time delegate the powers or duties of such officer to any other officer or any Director or other person whom they may select.
     (b) The Chief Executive Officer shall have general and active supervision and direction over the business and affairs of the Corporation and over its several officers; subject, however, to the control of the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer shall see that all orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried into effect. The Chief Executive Officer shall perform such other duties as from time to time may be assigned by the Board of Directors.
     (c) The President, the Presidents of the Corporation's Business Segments and the Vice Presidents shall perform such duties as the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors shall, from time to time, require.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOUSTON, Texas  NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) today held its annual meeting of stockholders in Houston, Texas, which serves as the headquarters for the corporation's subsidiary, Columbia Gulf Transmission, and base for its natural gas transmission and storage commercial team. President and Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Skaggs, Jr. spoke to stockholders about the company's four-point platform for long-term, balanced growth.
"Our Four-Point Platform for Growth has now been in place for more than a year and is on target for delivering long-term, sustainable growth," Skaggs said. He explained the plan's key components:

"NiSource is well positioned to meet our 2006 objectives and continue to build for the future," added Skaggs. "Our recent results show that we can deliver; that we're on track with the right plan and the right team. We are committed to doing what it takes to enhance long-term shareholder value."
During the meeting, stockholders voted in favor of a Charter Amendment Proposal to declassify board members, which the company will adopt. As a result, the annual election of all directors will begin with the 2007 annual stockholder meeting, with the terms for all current directors ending on the date of the 2007 annual meeting. Going forward, stockholders will have the ability to evaluate and elect directors on an annual basis.
In addition, stockholders voted in favor of a proposal to elect directors by majority vote. Stockholder proposals, by their nature, are advisory and not binding on the corporation, and any such changes would require a charter or by-law amendment to become effective.
Stockholders also voted to elect Gary L. Neale, Robert J. Welsh and Roger A. Young, as directors of the company. Due to the simultaneous adoption of the Charter Amendment Proposal, as voted on by the stockholders, these directors' terms will end on the date of the 2007 annual stockholders' meeting. Finally, stockholders voted in favor of the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte and Touche LLP as the company's independent public accountants for 2006.
