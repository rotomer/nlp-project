A. NiSource Inc. (the "Company") and NiSource Finance Corp. ("NiSource Finance") and Banc of America Securities LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., acting for themselves and as representatives of the other several underwriters (the "Underwriters"), have entered into a Terms Agreement, dated August 28, 2007 (the "Terms Agreement"), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below), NiSource Finance has agreed to sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters have agreed to purchase from NiSource Finance, $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of NiSource Finance's 6.40% Notes Due 2018 (the "Notes") unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The Terms Agreement incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of an Underwriting Agreement, dated August 28, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), of the Company with respect to common stock, preferred stock and guarantees of debt securities and of NiSource Finance with respect to debt securities. The Notes will be issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2000, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), among the Company, NiSource Finance and The Bank of New York, the successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee. The terms of the Notes are as set forth in the Indenture and in the form of global note that will represent the Notes. The Company and NiSource Finance are offering and selling the Notes under their Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-107421 and 333-107421-01).
The Company and the Underwriters expect to consummate the sale and purchase of the Notes on August 31, 2007. The Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate equal to 6.40% per year, payable semi-annually, and mature on March 15, 2018. The Notes will be sold to the public at an aggregate issue price of 99.905% of the principal amount thereof ($799,240,000 in proceeds before underwriting commissions and transaction expenses). The net proceeds to NiSource Finance from the sale of the Notes, after the underwriting discount, but before transaction expenses of the sale of the Notes, will be $794,040,000. Following the issuance of the Notes, NiSource Finance may redeem the Notes, in whole or part, from time to time pursuant to the "make whole" provision set forth in the Indenture and form of global note. The material terms of the Notes are described in the prospectus supplement of the Company and NiSource Finance dated August 28, 2007, which relates to the offer and sale of the Notes (the "Prospectus Supplement"), and the Company and NiSource Finance's prospectus dated August 7, 2003, which prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time of certain of the Company's and NiSource Finance's securities (the "Prospectus").

A Pricing Term Sheet, dated August 28, 2007, relating to the Notes was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act on August 28, 2007. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and NiSource Finance, conditions to closing and indemnification rights and obligations of the parties.

          (iii)   on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of NiSource, inquiries of officials of NiSource who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
     (A)   the unaudited financial statements, if any, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the related published rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
     (B)   if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, the unaudited consolidated operating revenues, gross income, net income and net income per share amounts or other amounts constituting such "capsule" information and described in such letter do not agree with the corresponding amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited statements of income;
     (C)   at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of such letter, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of NiSource and its consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any decrease in consolidated net current assets or net assets, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus; or
     (D)   for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Prospectus and Final Supplemented Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, in consolidated gross revenues, operating incomeor net income;

          (iv)   they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Supplemented Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of NiSource and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of NiSource's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.

   Indemnification and Contribution.
provided
however
          (b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless NiSource and NiSource Finance, their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls each of NiSource and NiSource Finance within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which NiSource or NiSource Finance
 
may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to NiSource or NiSource Finance by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by NiSource or NiSource Finance in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by NiSource and NiSource Finance bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by NiSource and NiSource Finance on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
 
omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of NiSource and NiSource Finance under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which NiSource or NiSource Finance may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of NiSource and NiSource Finance, to each officer of NiSource and NiSource Finance who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls NiSource or NiSource Finance within the meaning of the Act.
     8.. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if preferred stock or Common Stock) of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be, for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or NiSource or NiSource Finance, except as provided in Section 9. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. If the Offered Securities are debt securities or preferred stock, the respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts (if debt securities) or numbers of shares (if preferred stock) of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by NiSource and/or NiSource Finance, as the case may be.
   Default of Underwriters
     9.. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of NiSource, NiSource Finance or their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, NiSource, NiSource Finance or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated,
   Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
 
NiSource and NiSource Finance shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of NiSource, NiSource Finance and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of Section 6(c), NiSource and/or NiSource Finance will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
     10.. All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to them at their address furnished to NiSource in writing for the purpose of communications hereunder or, if sent to NiSource, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 801 East 86th Avenue, Merrillville, Indiana 46410, Attention: David J. Vajda, if sent to NiSource Finance, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 801 East 86th Avenue, Merrillville, Indiana 46410, Attention: David J. Vajda, in each case with a copy to Peter V. Fazio, Jr., Schiff Hardin LLP, 6600 Sears Tower, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6473.

The Company will pay interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2008.

3. Guarantee
     NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation and parent of the Company, will fully and unconditionally guarantee to each Holder of the Notes and to The Bank of New York (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee") under the Indenture (as defined below) and its successors all the Obligations of the Company under the Notes, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes (the "Security Guarantee").

4. Paying Agent and Security Registrar
     Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Security Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Company may act as Paying Agent or Security Registrar.
5. Indenture
     The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of November 14, 2000, among the Company, NiSource Inc. and the Trustee (as supplemented, the "Indenture") and pursuant to an Officers' Certificate of the Company dated August 31, 2007 (the "Officer's Certificate"). The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and the Officer's Certificate and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Officer's Certificate (the "Act"). Capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Indenture but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms.
     The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company, NiSource Inc. and their Subsidiaries (other than Utilities) to incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets unless the total amount of all the secured debt would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
6. Optional Redemption
     The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time at its option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date or (2) the Make-Whole Amount for the Notes being redeemed. For purposes of this provision:
     "Make-Whole Amount" means the sum, as determined by a Quotation Agent, of the present values of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with scheduled payments of interest (exclusive of interest to the Redemption Date) from the Redemption Date to the Stated Maturity of the Notes, in each case discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus accrued interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant
 
Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term of the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date, in each case calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date, plus 0.30%.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term from the Redemption Date to the Stated Maturity of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, if clause (ii) of the definition of Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of three, or such lesser number as is obtained by the Trustee, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
     "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means a primary U.S. Government securities dealer selected by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
7. Notice of Redemption
     If the Company is redeeming less than all the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed using a method it considers fair and appropriate. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed in accordance with Section 106 of the Indenture. Notes in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. The Company will not know the exact Redemption Price until three Business Days before the Redemption Date. Therefore, the notice of redemption will only describe how the
 
Redemption Price will be calculated. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on all Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on such Notes (or such portions thereof) called for redemption.
8. Additional Notes
     The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue Additional Notes ranking equally with the Notes in all respects, including having the same CUSIP number, so that such Additional Notes shall be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and shall have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Notes. No Additional Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes.
9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
     The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
10. Persons Deemed Owners
     The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
11. Unclaimed Money
     If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee, the Paying Agent or NiSource Inc., as guarantor, for payment.
12. Satisfaction and Discharge
     Under the Indenture, the Company can terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation when those Notes have become due and payable or will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving notice of redemption. The Company may terminate its obligations with respect to the Notes by depositing with the Trustee, as funds in trust dedicated solely for that purpose, an amount sufficient to pay and discharge
 
the entire indebtedness on the Notes. In that case, the Indenture will cease to be of further effect and the Company's obligations will be satisfied and discharged with respect to the Notes (except as to the Company's obligations to pay all other amounts due under the Indenture and to provide certain Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel to the Trustee). At the expense of the Company, the Trustee will execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge.
13. Amendment, Waiver
     Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee shall be entitled to amend the Indenture to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or to evidence the succession of another Person as obligor under the Indenture, or to add to the Company's or NiSource Inc.'s covenants or to surrender any right or power conferred on the Company or NiSource Inc. under the Indenture, or to add events of default, or to secure the Notes, or to evidence or provide for the acceptance or appointment by a successor Trustee or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the Indenture by more than one trustee, or to effect assumption by NiSource Inc. or one of its Subsidiaries of the Company's obligations under the Indenture, or to conform the Indenture to any amendment of the Trust Indenture Act.
14. Defaults and Remedies
     Under the Indenture, Events of Default include: (i) default by the Company in the payment of any interest upon any Note and the continuance of such default for 60 days; (ii) default by the Company in the payment of principal of or any premium on any Note when due at Stated Maturity, on redemption, by declaration or otherwise, and the continuance of such default for three Business Days; (iii) default by the Company or NiSource Inc. in the performance of or breach of any covenant or warranty in the Indenture and continuance of such default for 90 days after written notice to the Company or NiSource Inc. from the Trustee or to the Company, NiSource Inc. and the Trustee from the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; (iv) default by the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc., or the Company or NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. defaults under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued, secured or evidenced indebtedness constituting a failure to pay in excess of $50,000,000 of the principal or interest when due and payable, subject to certain cure rights; (v) the guarantee by NiSource Inc. ceases to be in full force and effect or is disaffirmed or denied (other than according to its terms), or is found to be unenforceable or invalid; or (vi) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company, NiSource Capital Markets, Inc. or NiSource Inc. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
 
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the interest of the Holders.
15. Trustee Dealings with the Company
     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16. No Recourse Against Others
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company, NiSource Inc. or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture, or any obligations of NiSource Inc. under the Security Guarantee or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes and the Security Guarantee.
17. Authentication
     This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an Authenticating Agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
18. Abbreviations
     Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
19. CUSIP, ISIN and Common Code Numbers
     Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. To the extent such numbers have been issued,
 
the Company has caused ISIN and Common Code numbers to be similarly printed on the Notes and has similarly instructed the Trustee. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
20. Governing Law.
     THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONTRARY CONFLICT OF LAWS OR CHOICE OF LAWS PROVISIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
