On October 16, 2007, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) announced that it has reached an agreement with the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), LaPorte County and a group of NIPSCO industrial customers to resolve a challenge relating to the costs paid by customers for power purchased by NIPSCO. This Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. NIPSCO has agreed to pay a one-time refund to customers of $33.5 million to resolve a dispute relating to power purchased from January 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. Effective October 1, 2007, NIPSCO will implement a new "benchmarking standard" that will govern the allocation of costs for purchased power. The agreement also contemplates NIPSCO adding additional generating capacity. The benchmark will be adjusted to reflect new capacity additions. Further, the settling parties agree to support NIPSCO's deferral and future recovery of carrying costs and depreciation associated with the acquisition of new generating facilities.
