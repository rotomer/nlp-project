ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On September 23, 2008, NiSource Finance Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NiSource Inc. (the "Company") entered into a new $500 million Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of seven banks. Barclays Capital served as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving loan advances in amounts not to exceed an aggregate of $500 million outstanding at any one time. The Company is a Guarantor under the Agreement. The purpose of the new credit facility is to provide an additional line of credit to accommodate the Company's seasonal cash flow requirements, including the impact of increased natural gas prices, as well as for general corporate purposes. A copy of the Revolving Credit Agreement is attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 10.1.
The Revolving Credit Agreement is effective until March 23, 2009. Pricing under the new facility will vary based upon LIBOR market rates, in combination with the 30-day average of the Company's 5-year credit default swap rate, as provided by Barclays Bank PLC. Current market rates would result in pricing under the facility at 5.25%. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes one financial covenant, a Maximum Debt-to-Capitalization covenant, set at 70%, and various other covenants that are standard for similar credit agreements. Failure to meet the covenants beyond applicable grace periods and certain other events, including the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), could result in acceleration of due dates of any borrowings and/or termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains certain standard representations and warranties that must be made and certain other conditions that must be met for NiSource Finance Corp to borrow under the agreement.

SECTION 2.01. Commitments.
     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) such Lender's Exposure exceeding such Lender's Commitment or (ii) the sum of the Exposures of all of the Lenders exceeding the Aggregate Commitments.

The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.
     (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be to an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Aggregate Commitments. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurodollar Revolving Borrowings outstanding under this Agreement.
     (d) To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information:
     (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;
     (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
     (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Termination Date.
     
SECTION 2.03. [RESERVED]. [RESERVED].
     
SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings.
     (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., New York City
 
17
time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account established and maintained by the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's office in New York City.
     (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
     
SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections.
     (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
     (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.02 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
   (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions
 
18
thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
     (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
     (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
     
SECTION 2.07. Mandatory Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date.
     
SECTION 2.08. Mandatory Prepayments.
     (a) If at any time the Total Outstanding Principal exceeds the Aggregate Commitments then in effect for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, as a result of any reduction in the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09), the Borrower shall prepay Loans in such aggregate amount (together with accrued interest thereon to the extent required by Section 2.13) as shall be necessary so that, after giving effect to such prepayment, the Total Outstanding Principal does not exceed the Aggregate Commitments.
 
19
          (b) Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be accompanied by the Borrower's payment of any amounts payable under Section 2.16 in connection with such prepayment. Prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be applied ratably to the Loans so prepaid.
          
SECTION 2.09. Optional Reduction of Commitments.
          (a) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Total Outstanding Principal would exceed the Aggregate Commitments thereafter in effect.
provided
          (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 2.09(a) at least five Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.
provided
          (c) Each reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments immediately preceding such reduction.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
 
20
          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima facie
provided
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
          
SECTION 2.11. Optional Prepayment of Loans.
          (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
          (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, it being understood that the foregoing minimum shall not apply to the prepayment in whole of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all Lenders. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Revolving Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13 and by any amounts payable under Section 2.16 in connection with such prepayment.

Facility Fee
 
21
Commitment terminates; that, if such Lender continues to have any Outstanding Loans after its Commitment terminates, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Outstanding Loans from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Outstanding Loans. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that any Facility Fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
provided
          (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and for the account of the other Persons entitled thereto, the fees provided for in that certain fee letter dated August 21, 2008, executed and delivered with respect to the credit facility provided for herein, in each case, in the amounts and at the times set forth therein and in immediately available funds.
          (c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (for distribution, in the case of Facility Fees, to the Lenders). Fees due and paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

per annum
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.
per annum
          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitments.
provided
 
22
          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest.
          (a) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of its holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement to a level below

that which such Lender or its holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration its policies and the policies of its holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate it or its holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate it or its holding company as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of its right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than ninety days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of its intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the ninety day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
          (e) The Borrower shall pay (without duplication as to amounts paid under this Section 2.15) to each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender, from the date of such Loan until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period for such Loan from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such LIBO Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan. Such additional interest determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, accompanied by the calculation of the amount thereof, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.
          In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount
SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments.
 
24
reasonably determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (y) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposit from other banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          
SECTION 2.17. Taxes.
          (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Credit Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (and for any Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Credit Party to a Governmental Authority, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
25
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower or the Guarantor is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with an additional original or a photocopy, as required under applicable rules and procedures, to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as shall be necessary to permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Further, in those circumstances as shall be necessary to allow payments hereunder to be made free of (or at a reduced rate of) withholding tax, each other Lender and the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deliver to Borrower such documentation as the Borrower may reasonably request in writing.
          (f) Except with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, all amounts payable by a Credit Party hereunder shall be made by such Credit Party in its own name and for its own account from within the United States by a payor that is a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code).
          
SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-Offs.
          (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Section 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 11.03, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 11.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Obligations owing to it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the
 
26
aggregate amount of such Obligations and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of, or other Obligations owing to, other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans or other Obligations, as applicable; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Guarantor, the Borrower or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Guarantor (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower and the Guarantor consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower and the Guarantor rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower or the affected Guarantor in the amount of such participation.
provided
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to 2.05(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
          
SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
          (a) Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation from the Borrower under either of Sections 2.15 and 2.17 for any losses, costs or other liabilities shall use reasonable efforts (including, without limitation, reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office of such Lender for funding or booking its Loans or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates) to mitigate the amount of such losses, costs and other liabilities, if such efforts can be made and such mitigation can be accomplished without such Lender suffering (i) any economic disadvantage for which such
 
27
Lender does not receive full indemnity from the Borrower under this Agreement or (ii) otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
          (b) In determining the amount of any claim for reimbursement or compensation under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, each Lender will use reasonable methods of calculation consistent with such methods customarily employed by such Lender in similar situations.
          (c) Each Lender will notify the Borrower either directly or through the Administrative Agent of any event giving rise to a claim under Section 2.15 or Section 2.17 promptly after the occurrence thereof which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances of such claim.
          (d) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank, in any event having total assets in excess of $500,000,000 and who shall serve until such time, if any, as an Agent shall have been appointed as provided above. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
          (g) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own

decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
          (h) No Lender identified on the signature pages of this Agreement as the "Sole Lead Arranger" or that is given any other title hereunder other than "Administrative Agent", shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Lender so identified as the "Sole Lead Arranger" or that is given any other title hereunder, shall have, or be deemed to have, any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

          (b) The Guarantor hereby guarantees that the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Documents, regardless of any law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any such terms or the rights of the Beneficiaries with respect thereto. The obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Obligations or any Credit Document, or any delay, failure or omission to enforce or agreement not to enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise of any right with respect to the foregoing (including, in each case, without limitation, as a result of the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Beneficiary, the Borrower or any other Person); (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term in respect of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from the Credit Documents or any agreement or instrument relating thereto; (iii) any exchange or release of, or non-perfection of any Lien on or in any collateral, or any release, amendment or waiver of, or consent to any departure from, any other guaranty of, or agreement granting security for, all or any of the Obligations; (iv) any claim, set-off, counterclaim, defense or other rights that the Guarantor may have at any time and from time to time against any Beneficiary or any other Person, whether in connection with this Transaction or any unrelated transaction; or (v) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any other guarantor or surety in respect of the Obligations or the Guarantor in respect hereof.
 
46
          (c) The Guaranty provided for herein (i) is a guaranty of payment and not of collection; (ii) is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments have been terminated and the Obligations have been paid in full in cash; and (iii) shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Beneficiary upon or as a result of the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
          (d) The obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by any Beneficiary or any other Person at any time of any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other Person that may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Obligations or against any collateral security or guaranty therefor or right of setoff with respect thereto.
          (e) The Guarantor hereby consents that, without the necessity of any reservation of rights against the Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by the Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by any Beneficiary may be rescinded by such Beneficiary and any of the Obligations continued after such rescission.
          (f) The Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective of any lack of capacity of the Borrower or any lack of validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, and this Guaranty shall not be affected in any way by any variation, extension, waiver, compromise or release of any or all of the Obligations or of any security or guaranty from time to time therefor.
          (g) The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding or action, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, marshalling of assets, assignment for the benefit of creditors, composition with creditors, readjustment, liquidation or arrangement of the Borrower or any similar proceedings or actions, or by any defense the Borrower may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding or action. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts and obligations that constitute the Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of any such proceeding or action.
          
SECTION 10.02. Waivers.
          (a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives: (i) promptness and diligence; (ii) notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders upon this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty; (iii) notice of the incurrence of any Obligation by the Borrower or the renewal, extension or accrual of any Obligation or of any circumstances affecting the Borrower's financial condition or ability to perform the Obligations; (iv) notice of any actions taken by the Beneficiaries or the Borrower or any other Person under any Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (v) all other notices,
 
47
demands and protests, and all other formalities of every kind in connection with the enforcement of the Obligations, of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder or under any other Credit Document, the omission of or delay in which, but for the provisions of this Section 10 might constitute grounds for relieving the Guarantor of its obligations hereunder; (vi) any requirement that the Beneficiaries protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto, or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral; and (vii) each other circumstance, other than payment of the Obligations in full, that might otherwise result in a discharge or exoneration of, or constitute a defense to, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder.
          (b) No failure on the part of any Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any Credit Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. This Guaranty is in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights, remedies, powers and privileges the Beneficiaries may have by virtue of any other instrument or agreement heretofore, contemporaneously herewith or hereafter executed by the Guarantor or any other Person or by applicable law or otherwise. All rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Beneficiaries shall be cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Beneficiaries under this Guaranty against the Guarantor are not conditional or contingent on any attempt by the Beneficiaries to exercise any of their rights, remedies, powers or privileges against any other guarantor or surety or under the Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto against the Borrower or against any other Person.
          (c) The Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that, until the Commitments have been terminated and all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash, under no circumstances shall it be entitled to be subrogated to any rights of any Beneficiary in respect of the Obligations performed by it hereunder or otherwise, and the Guarantor hereby expressly and irrevocably waives, until the Commitments have been terminated and all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash, (i) each and every such right of subrogation and any claims, reimbursements, right or right of action relating thereto (howsoever arising), and (ii) each and every right to contribution, indemnification, set-off or reimbursement, whether from the Borrower or any other Person now or hereafter primarily or secondarily liable for any of the Obligations, and whether arising by contract or operation of law or otherwise by reason of the Guarantor's execution, delivery or performance of this Guaranty.
          (d) The Guarantor represents and warrants that it has established adequate means of keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and of other circumstances affecting the Borrower's ability to perform the Obligations, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to provide to the Guarantor any information it may have, or hereafter receive, in respect of the Borrower.

SECTION 11.02. Waivers; Amendments.
          (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Extension of Credit shall be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
          (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any interest thereon, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release the Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) waive any of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement set forth in Section 3.01 without the written consent of each Lender, or (vii) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

Indemnitee

          (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

SECTION 11.04. Successors and Assigns.
          (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby; provided that, except to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(b)(iii)(C), no Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by a Credit Party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
          (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and other Obligations at the time owing to it); that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, the Borrower must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default shall be continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 11.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
provided
          (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
          (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 11.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
Participant

provided
          (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.l5 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.
          (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; that no such
provided
 
53
pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
          (h) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Lender (the "") shall have the right, without the prior consent of the Borrower, to grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (the "") that is utilized by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make hereunder, that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPFV or shall relieve its Granting Lender of any obligation of such Granting Lender hereunder or under any other Credit Document, except to the extent that such SPFV actually funds all or part of any Loan such Granting Lender is obligated to make hereunder, (ii) if an SPFV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, such Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) the Granting Lender hereby indemnifies and holds the Administrative Agent harmless from and against any liability, loss, cost or expense (including for or in respect of Taxes) arising out of such identification and grant or any transaction contemplated thereby, and (iv) the provisions of this paragraph (h) shall not impose any increased cost or liability on any Credit Party. The making of a Loan by an SPFV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of its Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto agrees that no SPFV shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement or any other Credit Document for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent that, its Granting Lender makes such payment. As to any Loans or portions of Loans made by it, each SPFV shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or such portions of Loans would have had under this Agreement and otherwise; that (1) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Granting Lender and (2) its Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such SPFV's obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Loans or portions of Loans made by it. No additional promissory notes, if any, shall be required to evidence the Loans or portions of Loans made by a SPFV; and the Granting Lender shall be deemed to hold its promissory note, if any, as agent for its SPFV to the extent of the Loans or portions of Loans funded by such SPFV. Each Granting Lender shall act as administrative agent for its SPFV and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any SPFV shall be paid to its Granting Lender as administrative agent for such SPFV, and neither a Credit Party nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Granting Lender's application of such payments. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees that, until the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior Debt of any SPFV, it shall not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPFV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings (or any similar proceedings) under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph (h), an SPFV may (1) (A) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or any portion of its interest in any Loan to its Granting Lender or (B) with the consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)

The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 10.01(c)(iii) and 11.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 11.05. Survival.

Except as provided in Section 3.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.07. Severability.
          If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender or any Affiliate thereof is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any of
