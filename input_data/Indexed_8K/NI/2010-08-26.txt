Item 8.01. Other Events.
On August 25, 2010, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC") issued its Order in Northern Indiana Public Service Company's ("Northern Indiana") electric rate case (the "Order"). Northern Indiana is a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource Inc. ("NiSource"). Based on an initial review, the overall impact of the Order is in line with NiSource's expected outcome for the case and its financial outlook. The full text of the Order (Cause No. 43526) is available on the IURC's Electronic Document System at https://myweb.in.gov/IURC/eds/.
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding NiSource's initial assessment of the overall impact of the Order that are subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties. It should be read in conjunction with the "Forward-Looking Statements" section in NiSource's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and 2010 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (which sections are incorporated by reference herein), and in conjunction with other SEC reports filed by NiSource that discuss important factors that could cause NiSource's actual results to differ materially. NiSource expressly disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report.
