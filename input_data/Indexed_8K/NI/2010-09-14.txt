The parties acknowledge and agree that any Shares delivered by Party B to Party A on any Settlement Date will be newly issued Shares and when delivered by Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) to securities lenders from whom Party A (or an affiliate of Party A) borrowed Shares in connection with hedging its exposure to this Transaction will be freely saleable without further registration or other restrictions under the Securities Act, in the hands of those securities lenders, irrespective of whether such stock loan is effected by Party A or an affiliate of Party A (provided that such Shares may be subject to resale restrictions if the status of any such securities lender would cause any such resale restrictions to apply by virtue of its share ownership in Party B, status as an "affiliate" of Party B or otherwise). Accordingly, Party B agrees that the Shares that it delivers to Party A on each Settlement Date will not bear a restrictive legend and that such Shares will be deposited in, and the delivery thereof shall be effected through the facilities of, the Clearance System.
  
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the Agreement or in the 2002 Definitions, upon any Insolvency Filing in respect of the Issuer, this Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date thereof without further liability of either party to this Confirmation to the other party (except for any liability in respect of any breach of representation or covenant by a party under this Confirmation prior to the date of such Insolvency Filing).
The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that (1) at any point prior to any Insolvency Filing in respect of the Issuer, Party B shall have the unilateral right to elect Physical Settlement of this Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading "Settlement Terms"; and (2) this Transaction shall automatically terminate on the date of any Insolvency Filing pursuant to the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph solely to the extent that Party B failed to elect Physical Settlement of this Transaction pursuant to the provisions set forth above under the heading "Settlement Terms" prior to the relevant Insolvency Filing.
If an ex-dividend date for an Extraordinary Dividend occurs on or after the Trade Date and on or prior to the Maturity Date (or, if later, the last date on which Shares are delivered by Party B to Party A in settlement of this Transaction), Party B shall pay an amount, as determined by the Calculation Agent, in cash equal to the product of such Extraordinary Dividend and the Base Amount to Party A on the earlier of (i) the date on which such Extraordinary Dividend is paid by the Issuer to holders of record of the Shares or (ii) the Maturity Date. "Extraordinary Dividend" means the per Share amount of any cash dividend or distribution declared by the Issuer with respect to the Shares that is specified by the board of directors of the Issuer as an "extraordinary" dividend.
  
 
For purposes of clause (e) above, the "Share Amount" as of any day is the number of Shares that Party A and any person whose ownership position would be aggregated with that of Party A (Party A or any such person, a "Party A Person") under any law, rule, regulation or regulatory order that for any reason becomes applicable to ownership of Shares after the Trade Date ("Applicable Laws"), owns, beneficially owns, constructively owns, controls, holds the power to vote or otherwise meets a relevant definition of ownership of under the Applicable Laws, as determined by Party A in its reasonable discretion. The "Post-Effective Limit" means (x) the minimum number of Shares that would give rise to reporting or registration obligations or other requirements (including obtaining prior approval from any person or entity) of a Party A Person, or would result in an adverse effect on a Party A Person, under the Applicable Laws, as determined by Party A in its reasonable discretion, (y) 1% of the number of Shares outstanding.
minus
Party A represents and warrants to and agrees with Party B that (i) Party A does not know on the Trade Date of any event or circumstance which will cause the Share Amount to exceed the Post-Effective Limit on any day during the term of this Transaction and (ii) Party A will not knowingly cause the Share Amount to exceed the Post-Effective Limit on any day during the term of this Transaction for the sole purpose of causing the occurrence of an Acceleration Event.
  
 
Upon the occurrence of any Acceleration Event, Party A shall have the right to designate, upon at least one Scheduled Trading Day's notice, any Scheduled Trading Day following such occurrence to be a Settlement Date hereunder (a "Termination Settlement Date") to which Physical Settlement shall apply, and to select the number of Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date; that (i) in the case of an Acceleration Event arising out of an Ownership Event, the number of Settlement Shares so designated by Party A shall not exceed the number of Shares necessary to reduce the Share Amount to the Post-Effective Limit and (ii) in the case of an Acceleration Event arising out of a Stock Borrow Event the number of Settlement Shares so designated by Party A shall not exceed the number of Shares as to which such Stock Borrow Event exists. If, upon designation of a Termination Settlement Date by Party A pursuant to the preceding sentence, Party B fails to deliver the Settlement Shares relating to such Termination Settlement Date when due or otherwise fails to perform obligations within its control in respect of this Transaction, it shall be an Event of Default with respect to Party B and Section 6 of the Agreement shall apply. If an Acceleration Event occurs during an Unwind Period relating to a number of Settlement Shares to which Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement applies, then on the Termination Settlement Date relating to such Acceleration Event, notwithstanding any election to the contrary by Party B, Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement shall apply to the portion of the Settlement Shares relating to such Unwind Period as to which Party A has unwound its hedge and Physical Settlement shall apply in respect of (x) the remainder (if any) of such Settlement Shares and (y) the Settlement Shares designated by Party A in respect of such Termination Settlement Date.
provided
If Party B is unable to comply with the provisions of "Covenant of Party B" above because of a change in law or a change in the policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, or Party A otherwise determines that in its reasonable opinion any Settlement Shares to be delivered to Party A by Party B may not be freely returned by Party A or its affiliates to securities lenders as described under "Covenant of Party B" above, then delivery of any such Settlement Shares (the "Restricted Shares") shall be effected pursuant to Annex A hereto, unless waived by Party A.
It is the intent of Party A and Party B that following any election of Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement by Party B, the purchase of Shares by Party A during any Unwind Period comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) of the Exchange Act and that this Confirmation shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c).
Party B acknowledges that (i) during any Unwind Period Party B does not have, and shall not attempt to exercise, any influence over how, when or whether to effect purchases of Shares by Party A (or its agent or affiliate) in connection with this Confirmation and (ii) Party B is entering into the Agreement and this Confirmation in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade compliance with federal securities laws including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Party B hereby agrees with Party A that during any Unwind Period Party B shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, any Material Non-Public Information (as defined herein) to any EFP Personnel (as defined below). For purposes of this Transaction, "Material Non-Public Information" means information relating to Party B or the Shares that (a) has not been widely disseminated by wire service, in one or more newspapers of general circulation, by communication from Party B to its shareholders or in a press release, or contained in a public filing made by Party B with the Securities and Exchange Commission and (b) a reasonable investor might consider to be of importance in making an investment decision to buy, sell or hold
  
 
Shares. For the avoidance of doubt and solely by way of illustration, information should be presumed "material" if it relates to such matters as dividend increases or decreases, earnings estimates, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant expansion or curtailment of operations, a significant increase or decline of orders, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, significant new products or discoveries, extraordinary borrowing, major litigation, liquidity problems, extraordinary management developments, purchase or sale of substantial assets, or other similar information. For purposes of this Transaction, "EFP Personnel" means any employee of Party A or its affiliates who is involved in effecting purchases or sales of Shares in connection with this Transaction and any other person designated by Party A in a written notice to Party B.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Confirmation, in no event will Party B be required pursuant to this Transaction to deliver on any Settlement Date, whether pursuant to Physical Settlement, Net Share Settlement, Termination Settlement or any Private Placement Settlement, more than a number of Shares equal to 1.75 times the initial Base Amount to Party A, subject to reduction by the amount of any Shares delivered by Party B on any prior Settlement Date.
Party A may transfer or assign its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, without the consent of Party B, to any of Party A's Affiliates whose obligations hereunder and under the Agreement are guaranteed by Credit Suisse (USA), Inc. or an Affiliate thereof with a credit rating at least equal to that of Party A, so long as, solely if such transferee or assignee is not organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (1) Party B will not be required to pay to the transferee an amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) of the Agreement greater than the amount in respect of which Party B would have been required to pay Party A in the absence of such transfer or assignment, and (2) Party B will not receive a payment from which an amount has been withheld or deducted on account of a Tax under Section 2(d)(i) of the Agreement in excess of that which Party A would have been required to so withhold or deduct in the absence of such transfer or assignment.
Party B agrees to indemnify Party A and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and controlling parties (Party A and each such affiliate or person being an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint and several, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnified Party for the violation of federal or state securities laws and which arise out of, are in connection with, or relate to, the execution or delivery of this Confirmation or the performance by the parties hereto of their obligations under this Transaction and Party B will reimburse any Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto. Party B will not be liable under this Indemnity paragraph to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final and nonappealable judgment by a court to have resulted from an Indemnified Party's breach, negligence or willful misconduct.
  
 
Notwithstanding Section 6(f) or any other provision of the Agreement or any other agreement between the parties to the contrary, the obligations of Party B hereunder are not secured by any collateral. Obligations under this Transaction shall not be set off against any other obligations of the parties, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto or their Affiliates, by operation of law or otherwise, and no other obligations of the parties shall be set off against obligations under this Transaction, whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any other agreement between the parties hereto or their Affiliates, by operation of law or otherwise, and each party hereby waives any such right of setoff. In calculating any amounts under Section 6(e) of the Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, (a) separate amounts shall be calculated as set forth in such Section 6(e) with respect to (i) this Transaction and (ii) all other Transactions, and (b) such separate amounts shall be payable pursuant to Section 6(d)(ii) of the Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Confirmation shall be interpreted as requiring Party B to deliver cash in respect of the settlement of this Transaction, except (i) as set forth above under "Extraordinary Dividends" above or (ii) in circumstances where the required cash settlement thereof is permitted for classification of the contract as equity by EITF 00-19 as in effect on the Trade Date (including, without limitation, where Party B so elects to deliver cash or fails timely to elect to deliver Shares in respect of such settlement). For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting any damages that may be payable by Counterparty as a result of a breach of or an indemnity under this Confirmation or the Agreement.
Party A acknowledges and agrees that this confirmation is not intended to convey to Party A rights with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in any U.S. bankruptcy proceedings of Party B; , that nothing herein shall limit or shall be deemed to limit Party A's right to pursue remedies in the event of a breach by Party B of its obligations and agreements with respect to this Confirmation and the Agreement; and , that nothing herein shall limit or shall be deemed to limit Party A's rights in respect of any transaction other than this Transaction.
provided, however
provided further
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, Party A shall not have the right to acquire Shares hereunder and Party A shall not be entitled to take delivery of any Shares deliverable hereunder (in each case, whether in connection with the purchase of Shares on any Settlement Date or any Termination Settlement Date, any Private Placement Settlement or otherwise) to the extent (but only to the extent) that, after such receipt of any Shares hereunder, (i) the Share Amount would exceed the Post-Effective Limit, (ii) Party A's ultimate parent entity would purchase, acquire or take (as such terms are used in the Federal Power Act) at any time on the relevant date in excess of 8% of the outstanding Shares or (iii) Party A and each person subject to aggregation of Shares with Party A under Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated
  
 
thereunder (the "Party A Group") would directly or indirectly beneficially own (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 13 or Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder) in excess of the lesser of (A) 8% of the then outstanding Shares or (B) 36,925,000 Shares (the "Threshold Number of Shares"). Any purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that, after such delivery, (i) the Share Amount would exceed the Post-Effective Limit, (ii) Party A's ultimate parent entity would purchase, acquire or take (as such terms are used in the Federal Power Act) in excess of 8% of the outstanding Shares or (iii) Party A Group would directly or indirectly so beneficially own in excess of the Threshold Number of Shares. If any delivery owed to Party A hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, Party B's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and Party B shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, Party A gives notice to Party B that, after such delivery, (i) the Share Amount would not exceed the Post-Effective Limit, (ii) Party A's ultimate parent entity would not purchase, acquire or take (as such terms are used in the Federal Power Act) in excess of 8% of the outstanding Shares and (iii) Party A Group would not directly or indirectly so beneficially own in excess of the Threshold Number of Shares.
In addition, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any delivery owed to Party A hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of the immediately preceding paragraph, Party A shall be permitted to make any payment due in respect of such Shares to Party B in two or more tranches that correspond in amount to the number of Shares delivered by Party B to Party A pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Party A to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Party B, Party A may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Party A's obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. Party A shall be discharged of its obligations to Party B to the extent of any such performance.
Each of Party A and Party B agrees and represents that it is an "eligible contract participant" as defined in Section 1a(12) of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the "CEA"), and the Agreement and this Transaction are subject to individual negotiation by the parties and have not been executed or traded on a "trading facility" as defined in Section 1a(33) of the CEA.
  
 
  
 
Party B agrees and acknowledges that each of Party A and Agent is a "financial institution," "swap participant" and "financial participant" within the meaning of Sections 101(22), 101(53C) and 101(22A) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge that it is the intent of the parties that (A) this Confirmation is (i) a "securities contract," as such term is defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder or in connection herewith is a "termination value," "payment amount" or "other transfer obligation" within the meaning of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code and a "settlement payment," within the meaning of Section 546 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) a "swap agreement," as such term is defined in Section 101(53B) of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to which each payment and delivery hereunder or in connection herewith is a "termination value," "payment amount" or "other transfer obligation" within the meaning of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code and a "transfer," as such term is defined in Section 101(54) of the Bankruptcy Code and a "payment or other transfer of property" within the meaning of Sections 362 and 546 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (B) Party A is entitled to the protections afforded by, among other sections, Sections 362(b)(6), 362(b)(17), 362(o), 546(e), 546(g), 548(d)(2), 555, 560 and 561 of the Bankruptcy Code.
If any term, provision, covenant or condition of this Confirmation, or the application thereof to any party or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part for any reason, the remaining terms, provisions, covenants, and conditions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if this Confirmation had been executed with the invalid or unenforceable provision eliminated, so long as this Confirmation as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter of this Confirmation and the deletion of such portion of this Confirmation will not substantially impair the respective benefits or expectations of parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that this severability provision shall not be applicable if any provision of Section 2, 5, 6 or 13 of the Agreement (or any definition or provision in Section 14 to the extent that it relates to, or is used in or in connection with any such Section) shall be so held to be invalid or unenforceable.

Exhibit 5.1
NiSource Inc. 801 East 86 Avenue Merrillville, Indiana 46410
th
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333148239) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company and NiSource Finance Corp. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on December 21, 2007 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Registration Statement, which became effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, relates to the issuance and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act, of, among other securities, shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). We have also acted as counsel to the Company in connection with (i) the Terms Agreement (including the Underwriting Agreement incorporated by reference therein) dated September 8, 2010 entered into among the Company, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as agent for the Forward Purchaser (defined below), and the underwriters named therein (the "Terms Agreement") in connection with the Forward Agreements referred to below and (ii) letter agreements, dated September 8, 2010 and September 9, 2010, respectively, between the Company and Credit Suisse International (the "Forward Purchaser") relating to the sale by the Company of an aggregate of 24,265,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Shares") to the Forward Purchaser (collectively, the "Forward Agreements").
     This opinion letter is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.
     In connection with our opinion, we have examined the Registration Statement, including the exhibits thereto, and such other documents, corporate records and instruments, and have examined such laws and regulations, as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of this opinion. In making our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies and the legal capacity of all natural persons. As to matters of fact material to our opinions in this letter, we have relied on certificates and statements from officers and other employees of the Company, public officials and other appropriate persons.
     In rendering the opinions in this letter we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification, that each party to each of the documents executed or to be executed, other than the Company, (a) is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (b) has full power and authority to execute such documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder, (c) has taken all necessary action to authorize execution of such documents on its behalf by the persons executing same, (d) has properly executed and delivered, or will properly execute and deliver, each of such documents to
 
which it is a party, and (e) has duly obtained all consents or approvals of any nature from and made all filings with any governmental authorities necessary for such party to execute, deliver or perform its obligations under such documents to which it is a party. In addition, in rendering such opinions we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification, (i) that the execution and delivery of, and performance of their respective obligations under, the documents executed or to be executed by each party thereto, other than the Company, do not violate any law, rule, regulation, agreement or instrument binding upon such party and (ii) that each of such documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and enforceable against, each party thereto, other than the Company.
     We make no representation that we have independently investigated or verified any of the matters that we have assumed for the purposes of this opinion letter.
     Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Shares have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Forward Agreements against payment of the agreed-upon consideration therefor, will be legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the General Corporation Law of Delaware (which includes those statutory provisions and all applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such laws) and the federal laws of the United States of America, and we express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     The opinions expressed in this opinion letter are as of the date of this opinion letter only and as to laws covered hereby only as they are in effect on that date, and we assume no obligation to update or supplement such opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may come to our attention after that date or any changes in law that may occur or become effective after that date. The opinions herein are limited to the matters expressly set forth in this opinion letter, and no opinion or representation is given or may be inferred beyond the opinions expressly set forth in this opinion letter.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed September 14, 2010 and to the reference to us under the caption "Validity of the Shares" in the prospectus supplement dated September 8, 2010 with respect to the Shares and under the caption "Legal Opinions" in the prospectus dated December 21, 2007 contained in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
