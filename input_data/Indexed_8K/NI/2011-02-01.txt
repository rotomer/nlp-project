On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2010, of $294.6 million, or $1.06 per share, compared with $230.5 million, or $0.84 per share in 2009. Operating income was $921.3 million for 2010 versus $801.0 million in the year-ago period. Schedules 1 and 2 of this news release contain a reconciliation of net operating earnings and operating earnings to GAAP- Income from continuing operations.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2010, net operating earnings (non-GAAP) were $94.0 million, or $0.33 per share, compared with $99.1 million, or $0.36 per share, for the same period in 2009. On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2010, was $35.8 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with $88.5 million, or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.
"NiSource's established infrastructure investment-driven strategy continues to generate positive customer benefits, enhanced shareholder value and sustainable long-term earnings growth," NiSource President and Chief Executive Officer said.
Robert C. Skaggs, Jr.
"During 2010, our team executed on a broad array of key regulatory and financial initiatives, infrastructure enhancement programs and new growth projects. These achievements, combined with improved margins and increased usage in our industrial electric markets, enabled us to deliver on our earnings commitments for the fourth consecutive year, while remaining responsive to the needs of our customers and other key stakeholders."
 
Notably, NiSource's year-end results included:
Financial strength to fund increased 2011 capital investments
During 2010, NiSource successfully completed several important initiatives which strengthened its financial profile and position it to fund the company's broad array of infrastructure investment opportunities.
"With the successful completion of our equity offering and other key elements of our financial strategy, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the deep inventory of investment opportunities available across all of our business units and continue growing our earnings on a sustainable basis," Skaggs said.
Milestones in Indiana, Marcellus growth, gas distribution enhancements
Among NiSource's business units, significant progress continues at as the company takes steps to improve customer service and reliability, while addressing a number of important regulatory matters.

Capitalizing on its unparalleled geographic footprint, continues to complete and advance customer-driven growth projects across its system, primarily surrounding the Marcellus Shale production area.
NiSource Gas Transmission & Storage Operations (NGT&S)
"While growth project revenue increased in 2010, NGT&S' operating earnings for the year were adversely impacted by a variety of anticipated expense increases and reduced short-term transportation revenue resulting from a lack of natural gas price volatility," Skaggs said. "Looking forward, we remain very enthusiastic about NGT&S' growth prospects for 2011 and beyond  driven by accretive infrastructure investments which we expect to amount to about $200 million annually."
also continues to execute its strategy of combining long-term infrastructure replacement programs with complementary regulatory initiatives.

"Across each of our business units, the NiSource team continues to successfully deliver on an impressive portfolio of infrastructure enhancement, customer service and new growth investment opportunities," Skaggs noted. "These types of long-term regulated investments, which enhance the reliability, safety, and environmental sustainability of NiSource's business operations, are fundamental to our growth strategy and will continue to be our focus for 2011 and beyond."
Earnings growth outlook continues with 2011 guidance of $1.25 to $1.35 (non-GAAP)
Based on the continued success of its balanced business strategy and an extensive array of growth investment opportunities, Skaggs noted that NiSource remains confident that it will sustainably grow long-term earnings in the range of 3 to 5 percent annually.
Skaggs indicated that, in the near term  particularly as the company executes a number of regulatory initiatives  operating earnings growth may exceed the longer-term range. Accordingly, NiSource expects its 2011 net operating earnings (non-GAAP) to fall within a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share. He noted that the company's outlook continues to be premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets served by its utilities.
There will likely be differences between net operating earnings and GAAP earnings, but, due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, NiSource is not providing GAAP earnings guidance.
"Thanks to solid execution by the team, we made significant progress on our business plan during 2010  all built on a foundation of ongoing investment across all of our companies," said Skaggs. "This core strategy remains unchanged for 2011, although our ability to invest in our businesses has been enhanced by the steps taken over the last several years. As a result, the company is well positioned to sustainably grow shareholder value while meeting the needs of our customers and other stakeholders."

4
 
reported operating earnings of $342.9 million versus operating earnings of $329.4 million in 2009. Net revenues, excluding the impact of regulatory and tax trackers, increased $22.8 million, primarily attributable to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities and the implementation of new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program, partially offset by decreased residential and commercial margins, customer credits issued as a result of a rate case and decreased forfeited discounts and late payments.
Gas Distribution Operations
Operating expenses, excluding trackers, were $9.3 million higher than the comparable period, reflecting higher employee and administrative costs. This increase was partially offset by decreases in depreciation costs and uncollectible expense.
reported operating earnings of $377.2 million versus operating earnings of $408.9 million in 2009. Net revenues, excluding regulatory trackers, increased $12.8 million as a result of increased demand margin revenues due to the completion of growth projects and an increase due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to Hardy Storage Company from Columbia Transmission following Hardy Storage securing permanent financing. Additionally, there was an increase in the fees received from a contract buyout and higher mineral rights royalty revenues. These increases were partially offset by decreases in shorter-term transportation and storage services and lower mineral rights leasing revenues.
Gas Transmission and Storage Operations
Equity earnings decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to a decrease in earnings from Millennium Pipeline primarily resulting from higher interest costs from Millennium's August 2010 debt refinancing.
Operating expenses increased by $43.5 million, excluding trackers, due to higher maintenance and outside service costs, including accelerated maintenance programs and pipeline integrity management expenses. Additionally, there was an increase in employee and administration expenses, primarily pension and depreciation costs.
reported operating earnings of $218.3 million for 2010, compared with $162.3 million in 2009. Excluding regulatory trackers, net revenue increased by $71.2 million primarily from increased industrial margins and usage, due to the improved economy, increased recovery under NIPSCO's environmental investment mechanism and higher off-system sales.
Electric Operations
Operating expenses increased by $15.2 million, excluding trackers, due to increases in other taxes, primarily property, inventory disposal and other costs resulting from the rate case, and higher electric generation costs. These were partially offset by a decrease in a legal reserve, which was recorded in 2009, and lower uncollectible expense.
reported an operating earnings loss of $20.9 million for 2010 compared to a loss of $19.8 million for 2009.
Corporate and Other Operations
In the first quarter of 2010, the company eliminated the "Other" segment. Results previously recorded as "Other" are now included within "Corporate and Other Operations."
Other Items
Interest expense decreased by $7.0 million primarily due to the Nov. 2010 long-term debt maturity, the Dec. 2009 term loan repayment, the maturity of the company's Nov. 2009 floating rate note and lower short-term interest rates. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of $250.0 million of long-term debt in Dec. 2010, the issuance of the Dec. 2009 long-term debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the company's accounts receivable facilities.

Other, net increased from an expense of $1.4 million in 2009 to income of $3.8 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above.
The effective tax rate of net operating earnings was 35.8 percent compared to 38.5 percent for the same period last year. During 2010, rate settlements were approved that reduced income tax expense for accelerated tax deductions on property differences, whereas the company experienced increases in income tax expense in 2009 for additional deferred income tax expense related to state apportionment changes.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Operating Earnings  Segment Results (non-GAAP)

reported operating earnings of $113.0 million versus operating earnings of $114.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenues excluding the impact of regulatory and tax trackers decreased $5.2 million, primarily attributable to lower residential and commercial margins, as well as lower off-system sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities and the implementation of new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program.
Gas Distribution Operations
Operating expenses, excluding trackers, were $3.6 million lower than the comparable period due to decreases in depreciation and uncollectible expense which were partially offset by an increase in employee and administration costs, environmental expense and maintenance costs.
reported operating earnings of $100.0 million versus operating earnings of $116.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Other, net reflected an expense of $3.5 million compared to income of $0.9 million in 2009. The change in expense was the result of lower Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) equity recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower average construction in process.
The effective tax rate of net operating earnings was 36.3 percent compared to 38.6 percent for the same period last year.
