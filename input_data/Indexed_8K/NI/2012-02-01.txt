On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2011, of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with $285.2 million, or $1.03 per share in 2010. Operating income was $905.1 million for 2011 versus $905.7 million in the year-ago period. Schedules 1 and 2 of this news release contain a reconciliation of net operating earnings and operating earnings to GAAP.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2011, net operating earnings (non-GAAP) were $91.2 million, or $0.32 per share, compared with $93.6 million, or $0.33 per share, for the same period in 2010.

"2011 was a year of significant achievement, groundbreaking performance and industry-leading growth in shareholder value," NiSource President and Chief Executive Officer said. "Across the board, NiSource teams delivered on our well-established, infrastructure-investment-driven business strategy. This strategy generated earnings growth in line with our guidance range for the fifth consecutive year, and positioned the company to deliver total shareholder return of approximately 40 percent in 2011, significantly outperforming broader market and utility indices for the third consecutive year."
Robert C. Skaggs, Jr.
 
In announcing NiSource's 2011 results, Skaggs highlighted key business accomplishments and ongoing initiatives expected to drive continued earnings growth for the company during 2012.
Financial strength to fund $1.4 billion in 2012 capital investments
NiSource continued to build on its financial strength and discipline during 2011, positioning the company to take advantage of a deep and expanding inventory of identified investment opportunities across all its business units.
"Building on NiSource's disciplined, well-executed financial strategy, and the range of investment opportunities available to the company, we are pleased to announce a capital investment program of approximately $1.4 billion in 2012," Skaggs said. "This represents an increase of nearly 25 percent over our $1.13 billion 2011 program."
Skaggs noted that the increase will primarily fund attractive and accretive investment opportunities at its unit, as well as at . In addition, the company expects to invest $533 million at its business unit.
NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage (NGT&S)
Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO)
NiSource Gas Distribution (NGD)
The company's solid financial profile was further strengthened as a result of a number of key initiatives taken during 2011. These initiatives, which will serve to reduce financing costs, extend the company's debt maturity profile and help manage its liabilities, included:
 
 
 
 
Skaggs noted that, given NiSource's strong cash position, the company does not plan to draw upon its Sept. 2010 forward equity sale until the third quarter of 2012. NiSource closed the year with $364 million in net available liquidity.
NIPSCO electric positioned for continued long-term investment and growth
NIPSCO's electric business made significant strides during 2011 to advance its strategy of enhancing customer service and reliability, modernizing rate design and building a foundation for long-term, investment-driven growth.
 
 
 
"From the successful completion of the electric rate case, to ongoing customer, environmental and economic development programs, NIPSCO is well positioned for significant, sustainable investment and growth in northern Indiana," Skaggs noted. "Taken together, these efforts will strengthen system reliability, customer service and responsiveness, environmental and community quality, while providing stable ongoing earnings growth."
Leveraging gas transmission and storage and midstream growth opportunities
NGT&S also continues to advance key strategies to enhance system reliability, develop new growth projects, and leverage the company's strategic footprint in emerging shale gas production areas.
 
 
 
 
 
 
"On the heels of solid progress and the addition of experienced, energized leadership in 2011, our NGT&S team is fully engaged with customers to develop and execute on a broad array of infrastructure enhancement and new growth opportunities," Skaggs said. "Our NGT&S capital investment program for 2012 is approximately $430 millionan increase of 43 percent over 2011reflecting a significant increase in accretive expansion projects capitalizing on the attractive opportunities available to NGT&S in the developing shale supply regions. These and other projects will serve to enhance the long-term value of our assets for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and other key stakeholders."
Executing gas distribution infrastructure, customer and regulatory programs
Combining long-term infrastructure modernization programs with complementary customer programs and regulatory initiatives continues to be the focus at NGD.
 
 
 
 
"Our focus on infrastructure modernization at our utilities continues to benefit our customers and communities, as well as NiSource shareholders," Skaggs said. "Our proactive, collaborative approach, combined with appropriate regulatory treatment, has served us well as we execute on this long-term core strategy."
Earnings growth outlook continues with 2012 guidance of $1.40 to $1.50 per share
Based on the continued success of NiSource's balanced business strategy and a deep inventory of investment opportunities across each of its business units, NiSource expects to deliver 2012 net operating earnings (non-GAAP) within a range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share, representing solid growth over 2011 results.
There will likely be differences between net operating earnings and GAAP earnings, but, due to the unpredictability of weather and other factors, NiSource is not providing GAAP earnings guidance.
 
Skaggs noted that the company's outlook continues to be driven by execution of its infrastructure-investment programs and is premised on a relatively modest and gradual economic recovery across the markets served by its utilities.
"With a growing inventory of infrastructure investment opportunities and a strong financial foundation to support a $1.4 billion capital investment program, NiSource is well-positioned to continue growing earnings and increasing shareholder value in 2012 and beyond," Skaggs concluded. "Leveraging the momentum we have built over the past few years will enable NiSource to continue delivering on our financial commitmentsa strong and secure dividend, stable investment-grade credit ratings and long-term, sustainable earnings growth."
Full-Year 2011 Operating EarningsSegment Results (non-GAAP)

Refer to Schedule 2 for the items included in 2011 and 2010 GAAP operating income but excluded from operating earnings.

reported operating earnings of $438.8 million compared to $342.6 million reported for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010. Net revenues, excluding the impact of regulatory trackers, increased $31.2 million primarily attributable to new rates under Columbia Gas of Ohio's approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at other utilities. Additionally, there was an increase in residential and commercial margins. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in off-system sales and lower industrial margins.
NiSource Gas Distribution
Operating expenses, excluding the impact of trackers, were $65.0 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year primarily due to a reduction of approximately $75 million in depreciation costs as a result of reduced depreciation rates at NIPSCO. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee and administrative costs for the business segment.
reported operating earnings of $360.1 million versus operating earnings of $376.8 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010. Net revenues, excluding trackers, increased $50.5 million primarily attributable to an increase in demand margin revenue as a result of growth projects placed into service in 2011 and throughout 2010, the impact of new Columbia Gulf rates placed into effect on May 1, 2011, and an increase in mineral rights royalty revenue. These increases were partially offset by the recognition of revenue in the prior year related to a previously deferred gain for native gas.
NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage
Operating expenses, excluding trackers, increased by $66.8 million primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses, driven largely by pension contributions, increased environmental costs, higher software and separation costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs.
Equity earnings decreased by $0.4 million for 2011 compared to 2010.
reported operating earnings of $203.0 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared with operating earnings of $217.0 million for the prior year period.

NiSource Electric
 
Operating expenses, excluding trackers, increased by $13.4 million due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative expenses, higher outside service and rate case costs. These increases were partially offset by the costs incurred in the prior year related to an inventory write-off.
reported an operating earnings loss of $40.6 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, compared to an operating earnings loss of $21.1 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010 due to a reserve on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business.
Corporate and Other Operations
Other Items
Interest expense decreased by $15.5 million due to the repurchase of long-term debt in Nov. 2011 and Dec. 2010 and a long-term debt maturity in Nov. 2010. The benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in Nov. 2010, the issuance of long-term debt in Nov. 2011, June 2011 and Dec. 2010, and higher average short-term borrowings and rates.
Other-net reflected expense of $7.3 million in 2011 compared to income of $3.8 million in 2010. The increase in expense is the result of additional charitable contributions in the current year.
The effective tax rate of net operating earnings was 34.5 percent compared to 35.8 percent for the same period last year.

reported operating earnings of $89.0 million versus operating earnings of $99.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net revenues, excluding the impact of regulatory trackers, increased $24.9 million, primarily attributable to an increase in demand margin revenue as a result of growth projects placed into service in 2011 and throughout 2010 and the impact of new Columbia Gulf rates placed into effect on May 1, 2011.
NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage
Operating expenses, excluding trackers, increased by $37.9 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative expenses, driven largely by pension contributions, and an increase in software costs.

reported an operating earnings loss of $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to an operating earnings loss of $8.4 million in 2010 due to a reserve on certain assets related to the wind down of the unregulated natural gas marketing business.

Other Items
Interest expense decreased by $0.6 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the change in long-term debt noted above.
Other-net reflected an expense of $12.8 million compared to $3.5 million in 2010. The change in expense was the result of an increase in charitable contributions in the current year.
The effective tax rate of net operating earnings was 36.3 percent compared to 36.2 percent for the same period last year.
Income from Continuing Operations (GAAP)
On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2011, of $303.8 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with $285.2 million, or $1.03 per share in 2010.
On a GAAP basis, NiSource reported income from continuing operations for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2011, of $17.6 million, or $0.06 per share, compared with $34.2 million, or $0.12 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010.
The NiSource GAAP results reflect certain non-material corrections to its consolidated financial statements as of Dec. 31, 2010 and for the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2010. The effect of these non-material corrections was a decrease in income from continuing operations of $9.4 million or $0.03 per share for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010 and a decrease in income from continuing operations of $1.6 million or $0.01 per share for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2010.
On November 14, 2011, NiSource commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase up to $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 and 6.15% notes due 2013. A condition of the offering was that all validly tendered 2016 notes would be accepted for purchase before any 2013 notes were accepted. On December 13, 2011, NiSource announced that approximately $125.3 million of the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 10.75% notes due 2016 were validly tendered. Based upon the principal amount of the 2016 notes tendered, NiSource also repurchased $124.7 million of the 2013 notes. As a result of this tender offer, NiSource incurred $53.9 million in early redemption fees, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums and unamortized discounts and fees, which are recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, NiSource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the company's manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. Following the review, NiSource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded $35.5 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers.
