Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 15, 2012, NiSource Finance Corp. ("NiSource Finance"), as borrower, and NiSource Inc. (the "Company"), as guarantor, entered into an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with the lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Syndication Agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, and Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The Agreement amends NiSource Finance's existing $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement to extend the term by approximately two years, from March 3, 2015 until May 15, 2017, and to reduce the applicable margin component of the interest rate calculation. Other than extending the term and reducing the applicable margin, the Agreement substantially restates the existing Revolving Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
