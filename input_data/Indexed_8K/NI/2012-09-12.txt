Forward Looking Statements
Today's presentations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Examples of forward-looking statements in these presentations include statements and expectations regarding future dividends, operating earnings growth, earnings per share growth, capital investments, financing needs and plans, and investment opportunities. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations discussed in these presentations include, among other things, weather; fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities; growth opportunities for NiSource's businesses; increased competition in deregulated energy markets; the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives; dealings with third parties over whom NiSource has no control; actual operating experience of NiSource's assets; the regulatory process; regulatory and legislative changes; changes in general economic, capital and commodity market conditions; and counter-party credit risk, and the matters set forth in the "Risk Factors" section in NiSource's 2011 Form 10-K (which section is incorporated herein by reference) and in conjunction with other SEC reports filed by NiSource, many of which are beyond the control of NiSource. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this presentation. Future earnings are illustrative only and do not constitute guidance by the Company. NiSource expressly disclaims a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in these presentations.
With regard to Net Operating Earnings Guidance for 2012  it should be noted that there will likely be differences between net operating earnings and GAAP earnings for matters including, but not limited to, weather, restructuring costs and accounting changes. NiSource is not able to estimate the impact of such items on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis.
Regulation G Disclosure Statement
Today's presentations include certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in [Schedules 1 and 2 of the NiSource quarterly earnings release and pages 8 and 15 through 18 in the 2011 Statistical Summary Book, both of which are available on the NiSource Investor Relations website at http://ir.nisource.com/results.cfm and http://ir.nisource.com/annuals.cfm.
