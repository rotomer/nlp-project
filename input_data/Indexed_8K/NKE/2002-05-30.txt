Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. Banc of America Securities LLC Commerzbank Capital Markets Corp. Fleet Securities, Inc. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Tokyo-Mitsubishi International plc U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, Commerzbank Capital Markets Corp., Fleet Securities, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Tokyo-Mitsubishi International plc and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. (each, an "Agent", and collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December 13, 1996, as amended or modified from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate initial offering price of Notes (or its equivalent, based upon the exchange rate on the applicable trade date in such foreign or composite currencies as the Company shall designate at the time of issuance) to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that such additional Notes may be sold to or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
        This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent), in which case the applicable Agent will act as an agent of the Company in soliciting offers for the purchase of Notes.
        The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-71324) and pre-effective amendment no. 1 thereto for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company has filed such post-effective amendments thereto as may be required prior to its acceptance of any offer for the purchase of Notes and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable) is referred to herein as the
"Registration Statement"; and the final prospectus and all applicable amendments or supplements thereto (including the final prospectus supplement and pricing supplement relating to the offering of Notes), in the form first furnished to the applicable Agent(s) for use in confirming sales of Notes, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes but shall exclude the Statement of Eligibility of Trustee on Form T-1; provided, further, that if the Company files a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, after such filing, all references to the "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus furnished by the Company after the Registration Statement became effective and before any acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes which omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
        All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "disclosed", "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be.
SECTION 1.    
Appointment as Agent
.
        (a)
    Appointment.
    Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby agrees that Notes, except as otherwise provided in this Section 1(a), will be sold exclusively to or through the Agents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to appoint additional agents for the purpose of selling or placing Notes in one or more discrete transactions during the term of this Agreement under the terms of an agreement substantially identical to this Agreement (provided that the commission to be paid to such additional agents in connection with the sale of any Note shall be the applicable commission determined pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof); provided that such agent or agents shall not have been directly or indirectly solicited by the Company to place or sell the Notes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Agents of the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence. No commission will be payable by the Company to the Agents on any Notes sold by other agents or directly by the Company on its own behalf. As used herein, the term "Agent", in addition to Merrill Lynch and Banc One Capital Markets, Inc, Banc of America Securities LLC, Commerzbank Capital Markets Corp., Fleet Securities, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Tokyo-Mitsubishi International plc and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., refers to each person or entity which, at any particular time, is an agent, for the Company hereunder as evidenced by its execution of a counterpart of this Agreement.
        (b)
    Sale of Notes.
    The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to
time or in excess of the aggregate initial offering price of Notes registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. The Agents shall have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate initial offering price of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement.
        (c)
    Purchases as Principal.
    The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal. However, absent an agreement between an Agent and the Company that such Agent shall be acting solely as an agent for the Company, such Agent shall be deemed to be acting as principal in connection with any offering of Notes by the Company through such Agent. Accordingly, the Agents, individually or in a syndicate, may agree from time to time to purchase Notes from the Company as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers determined by such Agents. Any purchase of Notes from the Company by an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof.
        (d)
    Solicitations as Agent.
    If agreed upon between an Agent and the Company, such Agent, acting solely as an agent for the Company and not as principal, will solicit offers for the purchase of Notes. Such Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer for the purchase of Notes solicited by it on an agency basis other than those offers rejected by such Agent. Such Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any offer for the purchase of Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein. The Company may accept or reject any offer for the purchase of Notes, in whole or in part. Such Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer for the purchase of Notes has been solicited by it on an agency basis and accepted by the Company. Such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event that any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by such Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company, the Company shall (i) hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) pay to such Agent any commission to which it would otherwise be entitled absent such default.
        (e)
    Reliance.
    The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes purchased from the Company by one or more Agents as principal shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges as an agent of the Company shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.
SECTION 2.    
Representations and Warranties
.
        (a)  The Company represents and warrants to each Agent as of the date hereof, as of the date of each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes (whether to such Agent as principal or through such Agent as agent), as of the date of each delivery of Notes (whether to such Agent as principal or through such Agent as agent) (the date of each such delivery to such Agent as principal is referred to herein as a "Settlement Date"), and as of any time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (each of the times referenced above is referred to herein as a "Representation Date"), as follows:

SECTION 3.    
Purchases as Principal; Solicitations as Agent
.
        (a)
    Purchases as Principal.
    Notes purchased from the Company by the Agents, individually or in a syndicate, as principal shall be made in accordance with terms agreed upon between such Agent or Agents and the Company (which terms, unless otherwise agreed, shall, to the extent applicable, include those terms specified in Exhibit A hereto and shall be agreed upon orally, with written confirmation prepared by such Agent or Agents and mailed to the Company). An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to "this Agreement" shall include the applicable agreement of one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal. Each
purchase of Notes, unless otherwise agreed, shall be at a discount from the principal amount of each such Note equivalent to the applicable commission set forth in Schedule A hereto. The Agents may engage the services of any broker or dealer in connection with the resale of the Notes purchased by them as principal and may allow all or any portion of the discount received from the Company in connection with such purchases to such brokers or dealers. At the time of each purchase of Notes from the Company by one or more Agents as principal, such Agent or Agents shall specify the requirements for the officers' certificate, opinion of counsel and comfort letter pursuant to Sections 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) hereof.
        If the Company and two or more Agents enter into an agreement pursuant to which such Agents agree to purchase Notes from the Company as principal and one or more of such Agents shall fail at the Settlement Date to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase (the "Defaulted Notes"), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents or underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; provided, however, that if such arrangements shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period, then:
        (a)  if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial underwriting obligations bear to the underwriting obligations of all nondefaulting Agents; or
        (b)  if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, such agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent.
No action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of such agreement, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Settlement Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
        (b)
    Solicitations as Agent.
    On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, when agreed by the Company and an Agent, such Agent, as an agent of the Company, will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers for the purchase of Notes upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus. Each Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such purchase is not consummated for any reason. The Agents are not authorized to appoint sub-agents with respect to Notes sold through them as agent. All Notes sold through an Agent as agent will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed upon between the Company and such Agent.
        The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes through an Agent, as an agent of the Company, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. As soon as practicable after receipt of instructions from the Company, such Agent will suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent that such solicitation may be resumed.
        The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, in the form of a discount, equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of each Note sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, as an agent of the Company, as set forth in Schedule A hereto.
        (c)
    Administrative Procedures.
    The purchase price, interest rate or formula, maturity date and other terms of the Notes specified in Exhibit A hereto (as applicable) shall be agreed upon between the Company and the applicable Agent(s) and specified in a pricing supplement to the Prospectus (each, a "Pricing Supplement") to be prepared by the Company in connection with each sale of Notes. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Notes will be issued in denominations of U.S. $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000. Administrative procedures with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes (the "Procedures") shall be agreed upon from time to time among the Company, the Agents and the Trustee. The Agents and the Company agree to perform, and the Company agrees to cause the Trustee to agree to perform, their respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures.
SECTION 4.    
Covenants of the Company
.
        The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent as follows:
        (a)
    Notice of Certain Events.
    The Company will notify the Agents immediately, and confirm such notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (other than any amendment or supplement thereto providing solely for the determination of the variable terms of the Notes or relating solely to the offering of securities other than the Notes), (ii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (iii) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (v) any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to the Program or any debt securities (including the Notes) of the Company, or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Program or any such debt securities, or the withdrawal by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization of its rating of the Program or any such debt securities, and (vi) the issuance by any state securities commission or other regulatory authority of any order suspending the qualification or the exemption from qualification of the Notes under state securities or blue sky laws or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof as soon as possible.
        (b)
    Filing or Use of Amendments.
    The Company will give the Agents advance notice of its intention to file or prepare any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Notes, any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations) or any amendment or supplement to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time it became effective or to the Prospectus (other than an amendment or supplement thereto providing solely for the determination of the variable terms of the Notes or relating solely to the offering of securities other than the Notes), whether pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise, will furnish to the Agents copies of any such document a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such document to which the Agents or counsel for the Agents shall reasonably object.
        (c)

SECTION 8.    
Indemnification.
        (a)
    Indemnification of the Agents.
    The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls such Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
        (i)    against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
        (ii)  against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, provided that (subject to Section 8(d) hereof) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
        (iii)  against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by such Agent), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;
provided
,
however
, that this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Agent under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any preliminary prospectus to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Agent results from the fact that such Agent sold Notes to a person as to whom it shall be established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the 1933 Act if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof in sufficient quantity to such Agent and the loss, liability, claim, damage or expense of such Agent results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus or the preliminary prospectus supplement which was corrected in the Prospectus or in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and such correction would have cured such untrue statement or omission of a material fact giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense.
        (b)
    Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers.
    Each Agent severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 8(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agents expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
        (c)
    Actions Against Parties; Notification.
    Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the applicable Agent(s) and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the
defense of any such action;
provided
,
however
, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
        No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or 9 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
SECTION 9.    
Contribution.
        If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
        The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discount or commission received by each applicable Agent, as the case may be, bears to the aggregate initial offering price of such Notes.
        The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Agent(s), on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the applicable Agent(s) and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
        The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the applicable Agent(s) were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, (i) no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount or commission received by such Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any applicable untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, in connection with an offering of Notes purchased from the Company by two or more Agents as principal, the respective obligations of such Agents to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that each such Agent has agreed to purchase from the Company.
        For purposes of this Section 9, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
SECTION 10.    
Payment of Expenses.
        The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:
        (a)  The preparation, filing, printing and delivery of the Registration Statement as originally filed and all amendments thereto and any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto;
        (b)  The preparation, printing and delivery of this Agreement and the Indenture;
        (c)  The preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes, including any fees and expenses relating to the eligibility and issuance of Notes in book-entry form and the cost of obtaining CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Notes;
        (d)  The fees and disbursements of the Company's accountants, counsel and other advisors or agents (including any calculation agent or exchange rate agent) and of the Trustee and its counsel;
        (e)  The reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agents incurred in connection with the establishment of the Program and incurred from time to time in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
        (f)    The fees charged by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for the rating of the Program and the Notes;
        (g)  The fees and expenses incurred in connection with any listing of Notes on a securities exchange;
        (h)  The filing fees incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agents in connection with, the review, if any, by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"); and
        (i)    Any advertising and other out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred with the approval of the Company.
SECTION 11.    
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
.
        All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Agents or any controlling person of an Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for the Notes.
SECTION 12.    
Termination
.
        (a)
    Termination of this Agreement.
    This Agreement (excluding any agreement by one or more Agents to purchase Notes from the Company as principal) may be terminated for any reason, at any time by either the Company or an Agent, as to itself, upon the giving of 30 days' prior written notice of such termination to the other party hereto.
        (b)
    Termination of Agreement to Purchase Notes as Principal.
    The applicable Agent(s) may terminate any agreement by such Agent(s) to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, if (i) there has been, since the date of such agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or, if such Notes are denominated and/or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, in the international financial markets, or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development or event involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of such Agent(s), impracticable or inadvisable to market such Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of such Notes, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or with respect to Clearstream or Euroclear systems in Europe, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign or composite currency in which such Notes are denominated and/or payable, or (v) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to the Program or any debt securities (including the Notes) of the Company as of the date of such agreement shall have been lowered or withdrawn since that date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review its rating of the Program or any such debt securities, or (vi) there shall have come to the attention of such Agent(s) any facts that would cause such Agent(s) to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of such Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.

Re:
NIKE, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I am general counsel for NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), and am rendering this opinion in connection with the Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") dated as of May 29, 2002 between the Company and you (collectively, the "Agents") and in connection with the issuance by the Company of up to $500,000,000 (or its equivalent in one or more foreign currencies or composite currencies) in aggregate initial public offering price of its Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes"), having such terms and provisions established in an Officers' Certificate dated May 29, 2002 pursuant to the indenture dated as of December 13, 1996 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee ("Trustee"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on October 10, 2001 (File No. 333-71324), as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the Commission on January 22, 2002 (collectively, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), the "Registration Statement") (which Registration Statement also constitutes, pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act, Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Registration Statement No. 333-71975), a prospectus dated January 24, 2002 (the "Base Prospectus"), a prospectus supplement dated May 29, 2002 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the Distribution Agreement. The Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, including the Incorporated Documents, are herein collectively referred to as the "Prospectus".
        This opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to Section 5(b)(2) of the Distribution Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings ascribed to them in the Distribution Agreement.
        As such counsel, I have made such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, I have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others. In addition, I have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from public officials as I have deemed necessary.
        I am opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States and the internal laws of the State of Oregon and I express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state.
        Whenever a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that neither I nor any other lawyers in the Company's legal department have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as otherwise expressly indicated, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of any such statement.
        Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is my opinion that, as of the date hereof:
        1.    The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon, with corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
        2.    To the best of my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is the subject, required to be described in the Prospectus, which are not described as required.
        3.    Each of the Distribution Agreement and Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
        4.    The Notes, in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof, have been duly authorized for offer, sale, issuance and delivery pursuant to the Distribution Agreement by the Company;
provided
,
however
, that I have assumed that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that my be validly issued will be reduced dollar for dollar for any other debt securities issued and sold under the Registration Statement after the date hereof.
        5.    The issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Distribution Agreement and the Interest Calculation Agreement dated as of May 29, 2002 between the Company and Trustee will not result in the violation by the Company of (a) its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or (b) any federal or Oregon statute, rule or regulation (other than federal or state securities laws) known to me to be applicable to the Company or any order known to me of any court or governmental agency or body or in the breach of or a default under any material indenture, note, loan, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other written agreement creating, evidencing or securing indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money or any material lease to which the Company is a party, other than, with regard to (b) above, such violations, breaches or defaults which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not adversely affect the validity of the Notes.
        6.    To the best of my knowledge, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any Oregon court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Distribution Agreement, except such as may be required under state securities laws in connection with the solicitation by the Agents of offers to purchase Notes from the Company and with purchases of Notes by the Agents as principal, as the case may be.
        7.    The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business require such qualification, and in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole.
        8.    The Company is not, and upon issuance and sale of the Notes and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will not be, an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
        9.    The Incorporated Documents, when they were filed with the Commission, appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Incorporated Documents. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Incorporated Documents, I have assumed that the statements made and incorporated by reference therein are correct and complete.
        10.  No facts came to my attention that caused me to believe that any of the Incorporated Documents, when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when the Incorporated Documents were so filed, not misleading; it being understood, however, that I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Incorporated Documents.
        11.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus (or required to be filed under the Exchange Act, if upon such filing they would be incorporated by reference therein) or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described and filed as required.
        The opinions set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 above are based upon my consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to the transactions herein contemplated.
        This opinion is rendered only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without my prior written consent; provided, however, that Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP may rely on paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this opinion in connection with the opinion it is rendering to you pursuant to Section 5(b)(1) of the Distribution Agreement.

Re:
NIKE, Inc.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as special counsel to NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") dated as of May 29, 2002 between the Company and you (collectively, the "Agents") and in connection with the issuance by the Company of up to $500,000,000 (or its equivalent in one or more foreign currencies or composite currencies) in aggregate initial public offering price of its Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes"), having such terms and provisions established in an Officers' Certificate dated May 29, 2002 (the "Officers' Certificate") pursuant to the indenture dated as of December 13, 1996 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on October 10, 2001 (File No. 333-71324), as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the Commission on January 22, 2002 (the "Registration Statement") (which Registration Statement also constitutes, pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act, Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Registration Statement No. 333-71975), a prospectus dated January 24, 2002 (the "Base Prospectus"), a prospectus supplement dated May 29, 2002 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the Distribution Agreement. The Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, including the Incorporated Documents, are herein collectively referred to as the "Prospectus".
        This opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to Section 5(b)(2) of the Distribution Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Distribution Agreement.
        As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter, except where a specific fact confirmation procedure is stated to have been performed (in which case we have with your consent performed the stated
procedure), and except where a statement is qualified as to knowledge or awareness (in which case we have with your consent made no or limited inquiry as specified below).
        As to facts material to the opinions, statements and assumptions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company in the Distribution Agreement, and translations of documents that are not in the English language. We have not independently verified such factual matters.
        Whenever a statement herein is qualified as to knowledge, awareness, or a similar phrase, it is intended to indicate that those attorneys in the firm who have rendered legal services in connection with the transaction referenced above do not have current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement. However, except as otherwise expressly indicated, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of any such statement.
        We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal laws of the United States and the internal laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state. Various issues concerning Oregon law and certain other matters are addressed in the opinion of James C. Carter, Esq., General Counsel of the Company, which has been separately provided to you, and we express no opinion with respect to those matters.
        Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof:
        1.    The Indenture is the legally valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
        2.    The Notes, in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof, when duly completed, executed and issued by the Company in accordance with the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate, and authorized in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the purchasers in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement, will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
        3.    The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
        4.    The issuance and sale of the Notes, in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof, by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement will not result in the violation by the Company of any federal or New York statute, rule or regulation known to us to be applicable to the Company (other than federal or state securities laws, which are specifically addressed elsewhere herein), and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any federal or New York court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation of the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Distribution Agreement, except as have been obtained under the Act and as may be required under state securities laws in connection with the solicitation by the Agents of offers to purchase Notes from the Company and with purchases of Notes by the Agents as principal, as the case may be.
        5.    The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (in each case excluding the reports and proxy statements filed by the Company with the Commission and incorporated in the Prospectus by reference (the "Incorporated Documents")), as of its effectiveness or issue date respectively, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements for registration statements on Form S-3 under the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood, however, that we express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules,
other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or with respect to the Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, we have assumed that the statements made and incorporated by reference therein are correct and complete.
        6.    The statements in the Prospectus under the headings "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of the Notes," "Special Provisions Relating to Foreign Currency Notes" and "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," in each case insofar as such statements constitute a summary of legal matters, are accurate summaries in all material respects.
        7.    The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Act and no proceedings therefor have been initiated by the Commission; and any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Act.
        8.    The Notes, in the forms certified by the Company as of the date hereof, and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes," in each case insofar as such statements are summaries of legal matters.
        In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, and your representatives, at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents and related matters were discussed and, although we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents and have not made any independent check or verification thereof (except to the extent stated in paragraph 6 above), during the course of such participation, no facts came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the Incorporated Documents, at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents), as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that we express no belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules, other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or with respect to the Form T-1.
        The opinions rendered in paragraphs 1 and 2, relating to the enforceability of the Indenture and the Notes, respectively, are subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought; (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; (iv) we express no opinion concerning the enforceability of the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 4.4 of the Indenture; (v) we express no opinion with respect to whether acceleration of the Notes may affect the collectibility of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon; and (vi) we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision of the Notes and the Indenture to the extent it
requires any party to indemnify any other person against loss in obtaining the currency due under such Notes and Indenture following a court judgment rendered in another currency. Further, we wish to advise you that enforcement of the Notes and the Indenture may be limited by (a) requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in United States dollars (or a foreign currency or composite currency judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on the date determined pursuant to applicable law or (b) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments in foreign currencies or currency units outside of the United States.
        Our opinions set forth in paragraph 4 above are based upon our consideration of only those statutes, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to public offerings of medium-term notes.
        To the extent that the obligations of the Company under the Indenture may be dependent upon such matters, we assume for purposes of this opinion that the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Oregon, and has the corporate power and authority to consummate the transactions contemplated under the Distribution Agreement; that the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the Company; that the Indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the Company; that the Trustee under the Indenture is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; that the Trustee is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture; that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Trustee enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; that the Trustee is in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations; and that the Trustee has the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture.
        This opinion is rendered only to you and is solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions covered hereby. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without our prior written consent.

        (ii)  on the basis of procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of a reading of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three- month periods ended August 31, 2001 and the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 and the three- and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2001 and 2000, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (collectively, the "10-Q Financials"), a reading of the latest available unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company, a reading of the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and committees thereof since [day after end of last audited period], inquiries of certain officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters, a review of interim financial information in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information ("SAS 71"), with respect to the three-month periods ended November 30, 2001 and 2002, the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2001 and 2000 and the three- and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2001 and 2000 and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that:
        (A)  the 10-Q Financials included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations applicable to unaudited financial statements included in Form 10-Q or any material modifications should be made to the 10-Q Financials included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
        (B)  at                        , 2001 and at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date hereof, there was any change in the                        of the Company and its subsidiaries, any decrease in the                        of the Company and its subsidiaries or any increase in the                        of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, except in each case for any changes, decreases or increases that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur; or

        (iii)  based upon the procedures set forth in clause (ii) above and a reading of the Selected Financial Data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus [and a reading of the financial statements from which such data were derived], nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Selected Financial Data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 301 of Regulation S-K of the 1933 Act;

The Company will pay interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date;
provided, however
, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest payments will commence on the second Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date to the registered holder (the "Holder") of this Note on the Record Date with respect to such second Interest Payment Date. Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
        Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period").

Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date ("Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.

Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.

        The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency specified above (or, if such Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such Specified Currency or, if such Specified Currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then in the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union) (the "Specified Currency"). If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive any amounts payable hereunder in such Specified Currency. If the Holder of this Note shall not have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments. If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission. The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate. The "Market Exchange Rate" for the Specified Currency means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).

        All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.
        The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be. The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.
        Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or "Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such "Other/Additional Provisions".
        Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue" (the "Notes"). All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.
        This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof.

The "Redemption Price" shall be the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof as set forth below) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed. The Initial Redemption Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
        This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S. $1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S. $1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the "Repayment Date").

        If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount".
        For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause the yield on the Note to be constant. The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period) and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
        If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may, and in certain cases shall, be accelerated in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
        The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Notes or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to the Notes.
        The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Securities at the time outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, on behalf of the Holders of all such Debt Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture. Furthermore, provisions in the Indenture permit the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, in certain instances, to waive, on behalf of all of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series, certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and other Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange heretofore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

NIKE, Inc.
, an Oregon corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to                        , or registered assigns, the Principal Amount of                        , on the Stated Maturity Date specified above (or any Redemption Date or Repayment Date, each as defined on the reverse hereof, or any earlier date of acceleration of maturity) (each such date being hereinafter referred to as the "Maturity Date" with respect to the principal repayable on such date) and to pay interest thereon (and on any overdue principal, premium and/or interest to the extent legally enforceable) at a rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate specified above until the Initial Interest Reset Date specified above and thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions specified above and on the reverse hereof or in an Addendum hereto with respect to one or more Interest Rate Bases specified above until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company will pay interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, if any, specified above (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date specified above, and on the Maturity Date;
provided, however
, that if the Original Issue Date occurs between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest payments will commence on the second Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date to the registered holder (the "Holder") of this Note on the Record Date with respect to such second Interest Payment Date.
        Interest on this Note will accrue from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from, and including, the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for) to, but excluding, the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period"). The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions described herein, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes, as defined on the reverse hereof) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day, as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (the "Record Date");

, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof and premium, if any, hereon shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date ("Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the close of business on any Record Date and, instead, shall be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee hereinafter referred to, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note by the Trustee not less than 10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided for in the Indenture.

Any such wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by such Holder.
        If any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that if LIBOR is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after the Maturity Date to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day.

provided, however
, that if the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, such day must not be a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal Financial Center (as defined below) of the country issuing the Specified Currency (or, if the Specified Currency is Euro, such day must be a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is

open);
provided, further,
that if LIBOR is an applicable Interest Rate Basis, such day must be a London Banking Day (as defined below). "London Banking Day" means a day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in the LIBOR Currency (as defined on the reverse hereof)) in London. "Principal Financial Center" means (i) the capital city of the country issuing the Specified Currency or (ii) the capital city of the country to which the LIBOR Currency relates, as applicable, except, in the case of (i) or (ii), that with respect to United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, South African rand and Swiss francs, the "Principal Financial Center" shall be The City of New York, Sydney and (solely with respect to the Specified Currency) Melbourne, Toronto, London (solely in the case of the LIBOR Currency), Johannesburg and Zurich, respectively.
        The Company is obligated to make payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency specified above (or, if such Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing such Specified Currency or, if such Specified Currency is Euro, in the member states of the European Union that have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, then in the currency which is at the time of such payment legal tender in the related country or in the adopting member states of the European Union) (the "Specified Currency"). If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, except as otherwise provided below, any such amounts so payable by the Company will be converted by the Exchange Rate Agent specified above into United States dollars for payment to the Holder of this Note.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive any amount payable hereunder in such Specified Currency. If the Holder of this Note shall not have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, any United States dollar amount to be received by the Holder of this Note will be based on the highest bid quotation in The City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of whom may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange Rate Agent and approved by the Company for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for United States dollars for settlement on such payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all Holders of Notes scheduled to receive United States dollar payments and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holder of this Note by deductions from such payments. If three such bid quotations are not available, payments on this Note will be made in the Specified Currency.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars, the Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency by submitting a written request for such payment to the Trustee at its corporate trust office in The City of New York on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Such written request may be mailed or hand delivered or sent by cable, telex or other form of facsimile transmission. The Holder of this Note may elect to receive all or a specified portion of all future payments in the Specified Currency in respect of such principal, premium, if any, and/or interest and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the applicable Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
        If the Specified Currency is other than United States dollars or a composite currency and the Holder of this Note shall have duly made an election to receive all or a specified portion of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest in respect of this Note in the Specified Currency, but the Specified Currency is not available due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to the Holder of this Note by making such payment in United States dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) determined by the Exchange Rate Agent on the second Business Day prior to such payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate. The "Market Exchange Rate" for the Specified Currency means the noon dollar buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for the Specified Currency as certified for customs purposes (or, if not so certified, as otherwise determined) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Any payment made in United States dollars under such circumstances shall not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture).
        All determinations referred to above made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder of this Note.
        The Company agrees to indemnify the Holder of any Note against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any amount due hereunder and such judgment or order requiring payment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than the Specified Currency, and as a result of any variation between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Specified Currency amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate of exchange at which such Holder, on the date of payment of such judgment or order, is able to purchase the Specified Currency with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such Holder, as the case may be. The foregoing indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Company and continues in full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term "rate of exchange" includes any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.
        Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof and, if so specified on the face hereof, in an Addendum hereto, which further provisions shall have the same force and effect as if set forth on the face hereof.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Addendum is attached hereto or "Other/Additional Provisions" apply to this Note as specified above, this Note shall be subject to the terms set forth in such Addendum or such "Other/Additional Provisions".
        Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, NIKE, Inc. has caused this Note to be duly executed by one of its duly authorized officers.
        This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities (the "Debt Securities") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of December 13, 1996, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, National Association (successor in interest to First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities, and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series of Debt Securities designated as "Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue" (the "Notes"). All terms used but not defined in this Note or in an Addendum hereto shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or on the face hereof, as the case may be.
        This Note is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S.$1,000 and integral multiples thereof or other Authorized Denomination specified on the face hereof.
        This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following two paragraphs, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
        This Note will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company on any date on or after the Initial Redemption Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or from time to time in part in increments of U.S.$1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S.$1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at the Redemption Price (as defined below), together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), on written notice given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture) not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date. The "Redemption Price" shall be the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face hereof (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, specified on the face hereof as set forth below) multiplied by the unpaid principal amount of this Note to be redeemed. The Initial Redemption Percentage shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if any, until the Redemption Price is 100% of unpaid principal amount to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
        This Note will be subject to repayment by the Company at the option of the Holder hereof on the Optional Repayment Date(s), if any, specified on the face hereof, in whole or in part in increments of U.S.$1,000 or other integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination (provided that any remaining principal amount hereof shall be at least U.S.$1,000 or such other minimum Authorized Denomination), at a repayment price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount to be repaid, together with unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for repayment (the "Repayment Date"). For this Note to be repaid, the Trustee must receive at its corporate trust office not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date, such Note and [the form thereon entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed] [instructions to such effect forwarded by the Holder hereof]. Exercise of such repayment option by the Holder hereof shall be irrevocable. In the event of repayment of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unrepaid portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Company in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.

        If this Note is specified on the face hereof to be a Discount Note, the amount payable to the Holder of this Note in the event of redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity of this Note will be equal to the sum of (1) the Issue Price specified on the face hereof (increased by any accruals of the Discount, as defined below) and, in the event of any redemption of this Note (if applicable), multiplied by the Initial Redemption Percentage (as adjusted by the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction, if applicable) and (2) any unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity, as the case may be. The difference between the Issue Price and 100% of the principal amount of this Note is referred to herein as the "Discount."
        For purposes of determining the amount of Discount that has accrued as of any Redemption Date, Repayment Date or date of acceleration of maturity of this Note, such Discount will be accrued so as to cause an assumed yield on the Note to be constant. The assumed constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period that, except for the Initial Period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between Interest Payment Dates (with ratable accruals within a compounding period), a coupon rate equal to the initial interest rate applicable to this Note and an assumption that the maturity of this Note will not be accelerated. If the period from the Original Issue Date to the initial Interest Payment Date (the "Initial Period") is shorter than the compounding period for this Note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If the Initial Period is longer than the compounding period, then such period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period, with the short period being treated as provided in the preceding sentence.
        The interest rate borne by this Note will be determined as follows:
          (i)  Unless the Interest Category of this Note is specified on the face hereof as a "Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note" or an "Inverse Floating Rate Note" or the face hereof specifies that either "Other/Additional Provisions" or an Addendum hereto applies, in each case, relating to a different interest rate formula, this Note shall be designated as a "Regular Floating Rate Note" and, except as set forth below or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases (a) plus or minus the Spread, if any, and/or (b) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any, in each case as specified on the face hereof. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date specified on the face hereof;
provided, however
, that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate.

        (ii)  If the Interest Category of this Note is specified on the face hereof as a "Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note", then, except as set forth below or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, this Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases (a) plus or minus the Spread, if any, and/or (b) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date;
provided, however
, that (y) the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate and (z) the interest rate in effect for the period commencing on the Fixed Rate Commencement Date specified on the face hereof to the Maturity Date shall be the Fixed Interest Rate specified on the face hereof or, if no Fixed Interest Rate is so specified, the interest rate in effect on the day immediately preceding the Fixed Rate Commencement Date.
        (iii)  If the Interest Category of this Note is specified on the face hereof as an "Inverse Floating Rate Note", then, except as set forth below or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, this Note shall bear interest at the Fixed Interest Rate minus the rate determined by reference to the applicable Interest Rate Basis or Bases (a) plus or minus the Spread, if any, and/or (b) multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any;
provided, however
, that, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, the interest rate hereon shall not be less than zero. Commencing on the Initial Interest Reset Date, the rate at which interest on this Note shall be payable shall be reset as of each Interest Reset Date;
provided, however
, that the interest rate in effect for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate.
        Except as set forth above or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, the interest rate in effect on each day shall be based on: (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date; or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date; provided, however, that the interest rate for the period, if any, from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that if LIBOR is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
