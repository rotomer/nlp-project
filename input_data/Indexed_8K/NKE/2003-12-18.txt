Beaverton, OR (December 18, 2003) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported revenues and earnings for the Company's second quarter ended November 30, 2003. Second quarter revenues increased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, versus $2.5 billion for the same period last year. Second quarter net income totaled $179.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $152.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the prior year. "It was a great quarter," Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said. "These positive results span most of Nike's portfolio of businesses and categories. They reflect our management's ability to lead in innovative product, communication, and operational performance."* Knight added, "We are optimistic the momentum we are seeing in the business, coupled with the improving health of the footwear and apparel industry, is setting the stage for continued profitable growth through the remainder of fiscal 2004."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2003 through April 2004, totaling $4.4 billion, 9.7 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. Approximately four points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates. By region, futures orders for the USA were up one percent; Europe increased 16 percent; Asia Pacific grew 18 percent; and the Americas increased 11 percent. In Europe, eight points of the increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate movements contributed approximately four points and seven points, respectively, to futures growth in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Knight continued, "The 9.7 percent increase in our worldwide futures orders is the result of Nike's strong brand and product momentum around the globe. We are particularly pleased by the continued improvement in our USA region, which posted the first futures increase in six quarters. This rebound in the USA complements continued strong performance in our international regions, which delivered 16 percent futures orders growth for the period."* Regional Highlights USA ___ During the second quarter, U.S. revenues increased five percent to $1.09 billion versus $1.03 billion for the second quarter of 2003.
