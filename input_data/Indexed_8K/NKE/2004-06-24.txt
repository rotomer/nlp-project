(NYSE:NKE) today reported revenues and earnings for the Company's fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2004. Fourth quarter revenues increased 17 percent to $3.5 billion, versus $3.0 billion for the same period last year. Seven percentage points of this growth were the result of changes in currency exchange rates. Fourth quarter net income totaled $305.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $246.2 million, or $0.92 per diluted share in the prior year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, revenues increased 15 percent to $12.3 billion, compared to $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2003. Changes in currency exchange rates contributed seven percentage points of this growth. Full year net income totaled $945.6 million, or $3.51 per diluted share, versus $740.1 million before accounting change, or $2.77 per diluted share, in 2003. After a one-time charge from the cumulative effect of implementing Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 142 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets), the Company posted net income of $474.0 million, or $1.77 per diluted share in 2003. Philip H. Knight, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "It was a great year for the Nike brand around the world, complemented by outstanding results across our brand portfolio and the acquisition of Converse. We managed the business well, recording our highest gross margins ever and generating tremendous cash flow. But, most importantly," Knight added, "we focused on doing what we do best: creating energy and excitement through innovative new products and strong connections with consumers. As a result, Nike, Inc. posted its strongest revenue and earnings per share growth in five years, delivering 15 and 27* percent increases, respectively." Knight continued, "It was also a great year for Nike shareholders. Nike's stock price increased 27% for fiscal year 2004. During the year we raised our quarterly dividend over 40%, and in the fourth quarter, we completed our four-year $1 billion share repurchase program. Over the past four years, Nike has returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board has authorized a new four-year, $1.5 billion share repurchase program, reflecting confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong cash flows in the future."** Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery between June and November 2004, totaling $5.5 billion, 10.7 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. One point of this growth was due to changes in currency exchange rates.** By region, U.S. futures were up 10 percent; Europe increased nine percent; Asia Pacific grew 21 percent; and the Americas increased four percent. Changes in currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of three percentage points in Europe and two percentage points in Asia Pacific. The Americas orders included a six percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates.** Knight said, "Nike's brand momentum was clearly evident in our futures results, which reached their highest level in seven years. All of our regions posted healthy futures increases in both footwear and apparel, but we're particularly encouraged by results in the U.S. The region reported its strongest footwear futures growth in eight years."** Regional Highlights USA ___ During the fourth quarter, U.S. revenues increased six percent to $1.3 billion.
