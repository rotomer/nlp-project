REGARDING UPDATED FUTURES INFORMATION IN FISCAL YEAR 2004 10-K Beaverton, OR (July 30, 2004) NIKE, Inc. (NYSE: NKE) today filed its fiscal year 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes an update to its previously released futures information. The company reported that current futures orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2004 were 11.3 percent higher than the same period last year. This growth was 60 basis points higher than the 10.7 percent growth for the period reported in Nike's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004 earnings press release dated June 24, 2004. The change versus what the company had previously reported is due to increased orders primarily in its U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. These changes reflect orders taken in the normal course of business subsequent to Nike's earnings announcement, which the company is obligated to update in its Form 10-K filing. # # #
