(NYSE:NKE) today reported revenues and earnings for the Company's first quarter ended August 31, 2004. First quarter revenues increased 18 percent to $3.6 billion, versus $3.0 billion for the same period last year. First quarter net income totaled $326.8 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared to $261.2 million, or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year. "We're off to a great start," said Philip H. Knight, Chairman and CEO. "Our first quarter revenues reached record levels driven by strong results around the world and across all our brands. These results reflect both the strength of our brands and our ability to execute across our portfolio of businesses."* Knight added, "Nike's consistent performance has been the result of the quality of our management team and our commitment to delivering value to shareholders over the long-term."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2004 through January 2005, totaling $4.3 billion, 9.9 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. Approximately 0.7 percent of this growth was due to changes in currency exchange rates.* By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up 11 percent; Europe increased six percent; Asia Pacific grew 17 percent; and the Americas increased six percent. In Europe, three points of the increase were due to currency exchange rates. Currency exchange reduced the growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas by approximately 0.5 points and five points, respectively.* Knight continued, "The strong growth in futures is further evidence of the strength of our brand and product lines around the world. Growing consumer demand for Nike products was particularly evident in our U.S. region, where our futures growth reached the highest level in more than seven years."* Regional Highlights U.S. ____ During the first quarter, U.S. revenues increased 12 percent to $1.4 billion versus $1.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
