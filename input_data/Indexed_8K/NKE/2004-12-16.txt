EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE INVESTOR CONTACT: MEDIA CONTACT: Pamela Catlett Joani Komlos 503.671.4589 503.671.2013 NIKE REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 47 PERCENT; WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS INCREASE 9.1 PERCENT Highlights: - Record second quarter earnings per diluted share increased 47 percent to $0.97 versus $0.66 per diluted share a year ago - Highest second quarter revenues, up 11 percent to $3.1 billion - Gross margin improved 1.8 points to 44.1 percent - Worldwide futures orders increased 9.1 percent Beaverton, OR (December 16, 2004) -- NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported revenues and earnings for the Company's second quarter ended November 30, 2004. Second quarter revenues increased 11 percent to $3.1 billion, versus $2.8 billion for the same period last year. Second quarter net income totaled $261.9 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $179.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior year. "We posted another quarter of record results," said Philip H. Knight, Chairman and CEO. "Nike's second quarter revenues and earnings per share reached all-time high levels as a result of solid performance across our global portfolio. Our businesses in the United States and emerging markets such as China, Russia and Turkey, combined with favorable European exchange rates, helped drive much of this growth."* Knight added, "With the first half of our fiscal year in the books, we remain confident that our business strategy and consistent execution will allow us to deliver on our goals of healthy, profitable growth."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2004 through April 2005, totaling $4.9 billion, 9.1 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. Currency exchange rates had no net impact to this growth.* By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up 10 percent; Europe increased six percent; Asia Pacific grew 14 percent; and the Americas increased 15 percent. In Europe, one point of the increase was due to currency exchange rates. Currency exchange reduced the growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas by approximately one point and three points, respectively.* Knight continued, "Consumer demand for Nike products continues to grow, as evidenced by our sixth consecutive quarter of strong futures results. The U.S. market has been particularly robust, reporting futures growth of 10 percent. The Nike brand is healthier than ever and our innovative products continue to excite consumers around the world."* Regional Highlights U.S. ____ During the second quarter, U.S. revenues increased five percent to $1.13 billion versus $1.08 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. U.S. athletic footwear revenues increased nine percent to $680.0 million. Apparel revenues decreased three percent to $384.7 million. This decline was due predominantly to the expiration of Nike's license agreement with the NBA. Equipment revenues increased 11 percent to $67.3 million. U.S. pre-tax income increased 21 percent to $232.6 million. EMEA ____ Revenues for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew 13 percent to $961.1 million, up from $847.8 million for the same period last year. Eight points of this growth were the result of changes in currency exchange rates. Footwear revenues increased 13 percent to $531.8 million, apparel revenues increased 14 percent to $370.0 million and equipment revenues increased 18 percent to $59.3 million. Pre-tax income rose 43 percent to $197.6 million. Asia Pacific ____________ Revenues in the Asia Pacific region grew 17 percent to $483.5 million compared to $412.0 million a year ago. Three points of this growth were the result of changes in currency exchange rates. Footwear revenues were up 15 percent to $236.6 million, apparel revenues increased 19 percent to $207.8 million and equipment grew 23 percent to $39.1 million. Pre-tax income was up 14 percent to $112.0 million.
