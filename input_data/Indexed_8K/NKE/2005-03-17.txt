(NYSE:NKE) today reported revenues and earnings for the Company's third quarter ended February 28, 2005. Third quarter revenues increased 14 percent to $3.3 billion, versus $2.9 billion for the same period last year. Third quarter net income totaled $273.4 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $200.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the prior year. "Today's results mark another terrific quarter for Nike, Inc.," said William D. Perez, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer. "This was our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth. These consistently strong results were driven by excellent performance across geographies and brands, coupled with favorable trends in foreign exchange rates. In addition to another strong quarter for our U.S. business, emerging international markets such as China, Russia and Brazil produced significant growth. While the core Nike Brand fueled the majority of our growth, Nike Golf, Converse and Cole Haan were also major contributors to our positive results."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2005 through July 2005, totaling $5.2 billion, 9.6 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. Approximately one point of this growth was due to changes in currency exchange rates.* By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up nine percent; Europe increased seven percent; Asia Pacific grew 14 percent; and the Americas increased 22 percent. In Europe, two points of the increase were due to currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates contributed to the growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas by approximately two points and one point, respectively.* Perez continued, "Global consumer demand for Nike brand footwear and apparel continues to be strong, as evidenced by the growth in futures orders. Demand in the U.S. market remains particularly robust, as Nike product innovation continues to drive the trend toward performance footwear and apparel in this market."* Regional Highlights U.S. ____ During the third quarter, U.S. revenues increased nine percent to $1.3 billion versus $1.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
