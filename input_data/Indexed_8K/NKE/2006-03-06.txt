On January 23, 2006, NIKE, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Report") to report, among other things, the appointment on January 20, 2006 of Mark G. Parker as a director and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The first three paragraphs of Item 5.02 of the Report are incorporated herein by reference. At the time of filing the Report, the Company's Compensation Committee had not yet considered what adjustments would be made to Mr. Parker's existing agreement with the Company as a result of his promotion. The Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 to the Report to amend Item 5.02 to provide a brief description of a new agreement with Mr. Parker, in accordance with instruction 2 to Item 5.02 of Form 8-K. On February 28, 2006, the Company and Mr. Parker entered into a new Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"). The Agreement supersedes his prior Covenant Not to Compete and Non- Disclosure Agreement, amended as of December 28, 2004. The following description of the Agreement briefly summarizes the terms and conditions that are material to the Company, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement which is filed as exhibit 10.1 to this Amendment No. 1. The Agreement between the Company and Mark G. Parker contains a covenant not to compete that extends for two years following the termination of his employment with the Company. The Agreement provides that if Mr. Parker's employment is terminated by the Company, the Company will make monthly payments to him during the two-year noncompetition period in an amount equal to 1/12th of his then current annual salary and target performance bonus ("Annual Nike Income"). The Agreement provides further that if Mr. Parker voluntarily resigns, the Company will make monthly payments to him during the two-year noncompetition period in an amount equal to 1/24th of his then current Annual Nike Income. If Mr. Parker is terminated without cause, the parties may mutually agree to waive the covenant not to compete, and if Mr. Parker is terminated for cause, the Company may unilaterally waive the covenant. If the covenant is waived, the Company will not be required to make the payments described above for the months as to which the waiver applies. Note that Mr. Parker's previous Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement provided that if he voluntarily resigned, during the calendar year 2007, the Company would make monthly payments to him during the two-year noncompetition period in an amount equal to 1/12th of his Annual Nike Income.

EXHIBIT 10.1 COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT PARTIES: Mark G. Parker (Employee) NIKE, Inc., and its parent, divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates (NIKE) DATE: February 28, 2006 RECITALS: A. This Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed upon the Employee's advancement to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of NIKE, is a condition of such advancement, and is intended to supersede his prior Covenant Not To Compete and Non- Disclosure Agreement, amended as of December 28, 2004. B. Over the course of Employee's employment with NIKE, Employee will be or has been exposed to and is in a position to develop confidential information peculiar to NIKE's business and not generally known to the public as defined below ("Protected Information"). It is anticipated that Employee will continue to be exposed to Protected Information of greater sensitivity as Employee advances in the company. C. The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and disclosure of any Protected Information would result in severe damage to NIKE and be difficult to measure. D. NIKE makes use of its Protected Information throughout the world. Protected Information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment anywhere in the world. AGREEMENT: In consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows: 1. Covenant Not to Compete. _______________________ 1.1 Competition Restriction. During Employee's employment by _______________________ NIKE, under the terms of any employment contract or otherwise, and for twenty-four (24) months thereafter, (the "Restriction Period"), Employee will not directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for, or be connected in any manner with, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment and accessories business, or any other business which directly competes with NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations ("Competitor"). By way of illustration only, examples of NIKE competitors include but are not limited to: Adidas, FILA, Reebok, Puma, Asics, Saucony, New Balance, Skechers, KSwiss, Merrell, Timberland, Champion, Russell, Oakley, DKNY, Ralph Lauren/Polo Sport, B.U.M., FUBU, The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Umbro, The North Face, Foot Locker, The Sports Authority, Finish Line, Columbia Sportswear, Wilson, Mizuno, Callaway Golf, Acushnet, and Taylor Made. This provision is subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below. 1.2 Extension of Time. In the event that Employee breaches _________________ this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall automatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach through private settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective date of any such settlement judicial or other resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay Employee the additional compensation described in paragraph 1.4 below during any period of time in which this Agreement is tolled due to Employee's breach. In the event Employee receives such additional compensation for any such breach, Employee must immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE. 1.3 Waiver of Non-Compete. NIKE has the option to elect to _____________________ waive all or a portion of the Restriction Period or to limit the definition of Competitor, by giving Employee seven (7) days prior notice of such election; provided, however, unless Employee is terminated "for cause" (which shall only include continual and repeated neglect of duties or acts of dishonesty), any waiver of the Restriction Period must be with the consent of Employee. In the event all or a portion of the Restriction Period is waived, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay Employee for any period of time as to which the Covenant Not to Compete has been waived. 1.4 Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for ________________________ the Covenant Not To Compete described above, should NIKE terminate Employee's employment and the Covenant Not To Compete is enforced, NIKE shall pay Employee a monthly payment equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of Employee's then current Annual NIKE Income (defined herein to mean base salary and annual Performance Sharing Plan bonus calculated at 100% of Employee's last targeted rate) while the Restriction Period is in effect. If Employee voluntarily terminates employment and the Covenant Not To Compete is enforced, NIKE shall pay Employee a monthly payment equal to one-twenty-fourth (1/24) of Employee's then current Annual NIKE Income while the Restriction Period is in effect. 2. Subsequent Employer. Employee agrees to notify NIKE at the time ___________________ of separation of employment of the name of Employee's new employer, if known. Employee further agrees to disclose to NIKE the name of any subsequent employer during the Restriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of NIKE. 3. Non-Disclosure Agreement. ________________________ 3.1 Protectable Information Defined. "Protected Information" _______________________________ shall mean all proprietary information, in whatever form and format, of NIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties which NIKE is obligated to keep confidential.

Employee will also take reasonable security precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to insure that there is no use or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of this Agreement. 4. Return of Protected Information.
