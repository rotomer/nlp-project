(NYSE:NKE) today reported record results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2006. Third quarter revenues increased nine percent to $3.6 billion, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by three percentage points. Net income grew 19 percent to $325.8 million, compared to $273.4 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share grew 23 percent to $1.24, versus $1.01 last year. "We're very pleased with the performance of the Nike brand and our Nike Inc. portfolio, both for the quarter and year to date," said Mark Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer, Nike, Inc. "The strength of our product pipeline, brand portfolio and global reach is enabling us to balance continued challenges in markets such as Western Europe and Japan with strong momentum in other key markets and regions. This, combined with our ability to manage expenses, enabled us to deliver on our long- term goal of sustainable, profitable growth." * Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2006 through July 2006, totaling $5.4 billion, 2.9 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year.

Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and "at once" orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant portion of the business does not report futures orders.
