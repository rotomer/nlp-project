Excluding the charge, fourth quarter net income increased 4 percent and diluted earnings per share increased 7 percent to $1.39. For the full year, excluding the charge, earnings per share were $5.39, up 20 percent compared to last year. Mark Parker, Nike, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "With deeper focus on discrete segments of our business, strong connections with consumers through global initiatives such as Joga Bonito, and compelling product innovations such as Air Max 360, we delivered very strong earnings growth and record revenues for the year. The Nike brand has never been stronger. We deepened our brand leadership in core categories such as basketball and soccer, and experienced strong growth in key markets such as the United States, Latin America, China and Russia. Our broader brand portfolio also performed well, with stellar performances for the year from Brand Jordan, Nike Golf and Converse." "As we drive top-line results and extend our brand leadership," Parker continued, "we also remain committed to creating value for shareholders. Our management focus on operating expense leverage is playing an increasingly important role in delivering our long-term financial goals and we continue to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders through increased share repurchases and a rising dividend payout ratio."
