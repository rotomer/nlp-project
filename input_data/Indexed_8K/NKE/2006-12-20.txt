At the same time, we delivered strong earnings growth and a significant 19 percent increase in our dividend for shareholders. Our brands are strong, the company is growing revenues and profits, and we are delivering on our commitment to lead the industry with sharper focus, greater competitiveness and deeper influence through ongoing product innovation and consumer connections."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2006 through April 2007, totaling $5.6 billion, 7 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year.

Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and "at once" orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant portion of the business does not report futures orders.
