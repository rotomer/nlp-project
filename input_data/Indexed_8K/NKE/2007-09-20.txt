EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NIKE REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.12 Revenue up 11 percent; worldwide futures orders up 11.5 percent One-time tax benefit contributes $0.20 to earnings per share BEAVERTON, Ore. (September 20, 2007) - NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported financial results for the first quarter, ended August 31, 2007. Revenue grew 11 percent to $4.7 billion, compared to $4.2 billion for the same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue growth by 3 percentage points for the quarter. First quarter net income increased 51 percent to $569.7 million, compared to $377.2 million in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 51 percent to $1.12, versus $0.74 last year. The first quarter effective tax rate reflects a one-time benefit related to utilization of past foreign losses, contributing $0.20 per diluted share. The Company has now taken the steps necessary to realize this tax benefit, reducing the effective tax rate for the quarter by approximately 15.6 points. Mark Parker, President and CEO of Nike, Inc. said, "We're off to a strong start as our first quarter results reflect the power of our brands as well as the strength and diversification of the Nike, Inc. portfolio. We have an aggressive growth plan to achieve $23 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2011, and we're well on our way."* Parker continued, "As we execute against our long-term growth priorities, we will continue to distinguish ourselves as the industry leader with our relentless focus on creating innovative product, and on bringing a new level of excitement and energy to retail."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2007 through January 2008, totaling $5.9 billion, 11.5 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased reported orders growth by 1 percentage point.* By region, futures orders for the U.S. increased 3 percent; Europe (which includes the Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific both increased 17 percent; and the Americas grew 20 percent. Changes in currency exchange rates increased the reported futures orders growth in Europe by 3 percentage points. Changes in currency exchange rates increased reported futures orders growth in Asia Pacific by 1 percentage point. In the Americas region changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on futures growth.

Other Businesses ________________ For the first quarter, Other business revenues, which include Converse Inc., NIKE Golf, Cole Haan Holdings Incorporated, NIKE Bauer Hockey Corp., Hurley International LLC and Exeter Brands Group LLC, grew 12 percent to $628.7 million from $560.4 million last year. Pre-tax income increased 9 percent to $95.2 million for the quarter. The prior year first quarter results included a $14.2 million benefit resulting from the favorable settlement of arbitration proceedings against Converse; excluding this benefit, pre-tax income for the Other businesses grew 30 percent. The Company also announced today its intent to explore the sale of Nike Bauer Hockey. Following a strategic review of the company's affiliate brands portfolio, Nike determined that despite the strength of the business, Nike Bauer Hockey does not align with the Company's long-term growth priorities and exploring a sale is the best strategic alternative. The Company expects the exploration process and any potential sale that maximizes Nike Bauer Hockey's value to Nike will be completed within the current fiscal year. Commenting on the anticipated sale, Parker said: "We are focused on investing our resources where we will achieve the greatest returns, both within the Nike brand and within a strong portfolio of complementary affiliate brands. We're confident it's the right choice for our Company as we maximize our opportunities and drive toward our long-term growth targets. Given Nike Bauers market leading position, we believe we will be able to effectively execute this transaction." Income Statement Review Gross margins were 44.8 percent compared to 44.1 percent for the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses were 30.8 percent of first quarter revenues, which is comparable to the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter declined significantly to 15.0 percent primarily due to the one-time tax benefit described above. Balance Sheet Review At quarter end, global inventories stood at $2.2 billion, an increase of less than 1 percent from August 31, 2006. Cash and short-term investments were $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter last year. Share Repurchase During the first quarter, the Company repurchased a total of 5,757,101 shares for approximately $321.5 million in conjunction with the Company's four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006. As of the end of the first quarter the Company has repurchased a total of 23.8 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion under this program.
