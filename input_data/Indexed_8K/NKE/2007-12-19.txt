Pre-tax income increased 31 percent to $70.8 million for the quarter. Following a strategic review of the Company's affiliate brands portfolio, Nike management determined that Nike Bauer Hockey and the Starter brand did not align with the Company's long-term growth priorities. On November 15, 2007, the Company announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell the Starter brand to Iconix Brand Group for $60 million in cash. This transaction was completed on December 17, 2007. The Company is still exploring the sale of the Bauer Hockey business. On October 23, 2007, the Company announced it had reached an agreement on an all-cash offer to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of Umbro plc at 193.06 pence a share, which values the company at (pound sterling) 282 million or approximately $570 million. The acquisition will significantly expand Nike's global leadership in football, a key growth category for the Company. Commenting on these developments, Parker said: "Our focus on prime growth opportunities extends throughout our portfolio of brands. We are confident that our divestiture decisions this quarter are the right ones for Bauer Hockey, for Starter, and for Nike. As for Umbro, it is a brand that has tremendous heritage and respect in global football. We're very excited about leveraging those connections and bringing them to life in new ways that will reward consumers and strengthen our competitive stance in football around the world."* Income Statement Review Gross margins were 44.3 percent compared to 43.4 percent for the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses were 32.9 percent of second quarter revenues, compared to 32.0 percent last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.3 percent.
