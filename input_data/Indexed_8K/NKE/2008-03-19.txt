"Our strong third quarter results, driven by sales gains across our diversified portfolio of categories, geographies, and brands, are a clear indication that our strategy is working and that we're on track to achieve our financial goals for this fiscal year and beyond."* Parker continued, "Over the past twelve months we've taken a number of important strategic steps to strengthen the performance and potential of our portfolio of products and brands, steps we believe create stronger platforms for growth and allow us to connect even deeper with consumers. More than ever, the consumer is at the epicenter of everything we do and delivering the most innovative products and the most exciting consumer experiences is the key to our future growth."* Futures Orders The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from March 2008 through July 2008, totaling $6.9 billion, 11 percent higher than such orders reported for the same period last year.
