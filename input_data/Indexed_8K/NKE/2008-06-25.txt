For the fiscal year, Other business revenues increased 15 percent to $2.6 billion and pre-tax income increased 12 percent to $336.4 million. In fiscal 2008, following a strategic review of the Company's affiliate brands portfolio, the Company made a number of changes. During the year, the Company completed the divestiture of the Starter brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey and the acquisition of Umbro. The Starter brand was sold for $60 million in cash resulting in a gain of $29 million, which was included in third quarter Other income (expense). NIKE Bauer Hockey was sold for $189 million in cash resulting in a gain of $32 million, which was included in fourth quarter Other income, (expense). As part of the sale, the Company licensed the limited use of certain Company trademarks for a period of two years. Accordingly, $41 million of the sales price was deferred and will be recognized in Other income, (expense) over the license period. The acquisition of Umbro was completed in the fourth quarter for total consideration of (pound sterling) 290.5 million (approximately $576 million), inclusive of transaction fees. Income Statement Review In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 gross margins were 45.8 percent compared to 43.8 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal year, gross margins were 45.0 percent compared to 43.9 percent last year. Selling and administrative expenses were 33.1 percent of fourth quarter revenue compared to 29.0 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal year, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 32.0 percent versus 30.8 percent last year. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.3 percent compared to 33.5 percent for the same period last year, benefiting from a larger proportion of earnings coming from outside the United States where the Company benefits from lower tax rates. For the fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 24.8 percent compared to 32.2 percent last year; reflecting a one-time tax benefit related to utilization of past foreign losses that contributed $0.21 per diluted share, as well as continued improvements in the tax efficiency of the Company's global operations.

Cash and short-term investments were comparable to the end of last fiscal year at $2.8 billion.

These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the S.E.C., including Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K. Some forward- looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and "at once" orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant portion of the business does not report futures orders.
