Current year amounts are not directly comparable to the prior year due to changes in the Companys affiliate brands portfolio. In the first quarter of last year the Companys Other business segment included Converse Inc., NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Hurley International LLC, the Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey. Following a corporate strategic review the Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey were sold in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, respectively. .  First quarter revenues and pretax income for the continuing Other businesses (Converse Inc., NIKE Golf, Cole Haan and Hurley International LLC) grew 20% and 19%, respectively.
Income Statement Review
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009 gross margins were 47.2 percent compared to 44.8 percent for the same period last year. The increase in gross margin versus the prior year quarter reflects an improved sales mix of higher margin footwear products in the Companys U.S. and EMEA regions, favorable hedge results, sourcing cost initiatives and higher margins in our Other businesses, partially offset by higher input costs and lower apparel margins in the U.S.
As anticipated, selling and administrative expenses were 34.2 percent of first quarter revenue compared to 30.8 percent for the same period last year due to demand creation spend in support of the European Championships and the Olympic games in Beijing. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.5 percent compared to 15.0 percent for the same period last year. The prior year tax rate was significantly lower due to the one-time utilization of past foreign losses, which contributed $0.20 per diluted share to last years results.
Balance Sheet Review
At quarter end, global inventories stood at $2.5 billion, an increase of 14 percent from August 31, 2007.  Cash and short-term investments were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $2.8 billion at the end of the first quarter last year.
Share Repurchase Program
During the first quarter, the Company repurchased a total of 7,068,980 shares for approximately $429.8 million in conjunction with the Companys four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006.  As of the end of the first quarter the Company has repurchased a total of 45.7 million shares for approximately $2.5 billion under this program. On September 22, the Company also announced a new, four-year $5 billion share repurchase program to commence upon the completion of its current $3 billion program.
