BEAVERTON, Ore., Dec. 17, 2008
Our second quarter results demonstrate the power of the Nike brand and the diversity of the Nike, Inc. portfolio, said Mark Parker, NIKE, Inc. President and CEO. In challenging times like these its especially important to stay focused on what we do best  delivering the most innovative and relevant product, strengthening our relationship with consumers and driving excellence into every area of our business. Thats how we continue to lead the industry, take market share from competitors and grow our business.*
Parker concluded, I see the current state of our industry and the world as an incredible opportunity for Nike to be a better and stronger leader, and were going to seize that opportunity.*
Futures Orders
The Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from December 2008 through April 2009, totaling $6.7 billion, 1 percent lower than such orders reported for the same period last year.

By region, futures orders for the U.S. were up 6 percent; EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa) decreased 13 percent; Asia Pacific increased 11 percent and the Americas grew 6 percent.

Regional Highlights
U.S.
During the second quarter, U.S. revenues decreased 1 percent to $1.51 billion versus $1.53 billion for same period last year. U.S. footwear revenues increased 1 percent to $993.5 billion. Apparel revenues decreased 3 percent to $449.8 million. Equipment revenues decreased 17 percent to $70.1 million. U.S. pre-tax income decreased 18 percent to $253.3 million due to lower gross margins and higher selling and administrative expenses, primarily related to Nike-owned retail expansion.
Europe
Second quarter revenues for the European region grew 6 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for the same period last year. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue growth by 2 percentage points. Footwear revenues increased 6 percent to $688.3 million. Apparel revenues grew by 7 percent to $521.6 million and equipment revenues increased 1 percent to $96.3 million. Pre-tax income increased 19 percent to $276.5 million.
Asia Pacific
In the second quarter, revenues in the Asia Pacific region grew 22 percent to $821.4 million compared to $675.6 million a year ago. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Footwear revenues were up 20 percent to $400.1 million, apparel revenues increased 23 percent to $356.9 million and equipment revenues grew 23 percent to $64.4 million. Pre-tax income increased 25 percent to $216.0 million.
Americas
Revenues in the Americas region increased 21 percent to $384.6 million, an improvement from $316.9 million for the same quarter last year. Currency exchange rates reduced this growth rate by 2 percentage points. Footwear revenues were up 23 percent to $264.1 million, apparel revenues increased 20 percent to $88.2 million and equipment revenues grew 10 percent to $32.3 million. Pre-tax income was up 34 percent to $93.1 million.
Other Businesses
For the second quarter, Other business revenue, which includes Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro Ltd., decreased 4 percent to $564.5 million from $589.7 million last year and pre-tax income decreased 71 percent to $20.5 million.
Current year amounts are not directly comparable to the prior year due to changes in the Companys affiliate brands portfolio. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008 the Companys Other business segment included Converse Inc., NIKE Golf, Cole Haan, Hurley International LLC, NIKE Bauer Hockey, and the Starter Brand. Following a corporate strategic review the Starter Brand and NIKE Bauer Hockey were sold in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, respectively, while Umbro was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. For the continuing Other businesses (Converse Inc., NIKE Golf, Cole Haan and Hurley International LLC) second quarter revenues grew 3% while pretax income declined 51%. Pretax income was lower than the prior year, mainly due to gross margin declines within Nike Golf and Cole Haan, reflecting the weaker retail environment, and investments in demand creation and growth initiatives at Converse.
 
 
 
Income Statement Review
Second quarter gross margins were 44.7 percent compared to 44.3 percent for the same period last year. Gross margins were better due to favorable hedge results, price increases, and improved product and regional mix.
Selling and administrative expenses were 33.7 percent of second quarter revenue compared to 32.9 percent for the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses for the period were higher than last year due to a 5 percent increase in demand creation and a 10 percent increase in operating overhead spending as the Company committed funds to support growth initiatives such as owned retail, emerging markets and Other businesses.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 24.9 percent compared to 30.3 percent for the same period last year. The tax rate was lower than prior year mainly due to U.S. Congressional action to extend the research and development tax credit and a one time foreign tax refund.
Balance Sheet Review
At quarter end, global inventories stood at $2.4 billion, an increase of 9 percent from November 30, 2007. Cash and short-term investments were $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter, compared to $3.1 billion at the end of the second quarter last year.
Share Repurchase Program
During the second quarter, the Company repurchased a total of 3,497,100 shares for approximately $209.3 million in conjunction with the Companys four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006. As of the end of the second quarter the Company has repurchased a total of 49.2 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion under this program. On September 22, the Company announced a new, four-year $5 billion share repurchase program to commence upon the completion of its current $3 billion program.
