Fiscal 2009 was a year that challenged companies to leverage core strengths and adapt quickly to a changing landscape. Our strong results demonstrate that we are meeting these challenges and seizing the opportunity to optimize our position as the industry leader, said Mark Parker, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. By focusing on what Nike does best  creating great product, telling great stories, and connecting with consumers  I believe that we will become a stronger, more profitable, and more valuable company for our shareholders. Weve made some tough decisions over the past year, yet given our ability to increase our competitive separation through product innovation and brand relevance across our portfolio of businesses, I remain strongly optimistic about our long-term potential.*

Other Businesses
For the fourth quarter, Other business revenue, which includes Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, NIKE Golf, and Umbro Ltd. decreased 5 percent to $702.3 million and pre-tax income dropped 56 percent to $40.6 million. For the fiscal year, Other business revenue decreased 1 percent to $2.5 billion and had a pre-tax loss of $196.7 million versus pre-tax income of $364.9 million in fiscal 2008.
Due to changes in the Companys affiliate brands portfolio and the inclusion of an impairment charge in fiscal 2009 related to Umbro, current year amounts are not directly comparable to the prior year. In fiscal 2008, following a strategic review of the Companys affiliate brands portfolio, the Starter brand and Bauer Hockey were sold in the third and fourth quarter respectively, and Umbro was acquired in the fourth quarter.
For the continuing Other businesses (Cole Haan, Converse Inc., Hurley International LLC, and NIKE Golf) fourth quarter revenues declined 3 percent and pretax income declined 47 percent. For this same group, fiscal year revenue grew 5 percent while pretax income declined 28 percent. Pretax income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were negatively impacted by lower profits at Cole Haan and NIKE Golf, reflecting difficult conditions in these market sectors.**
Income Statement Review
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 gross margins were 43.4 percent compared to 45.8 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal year, gross margins were 44.9 percent compared to 45.0 percent last year. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were lower than the prior year primarily due to higher product input costs and product markdowns taken to manage inventories.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 selling and administrative expenses were 29.6 percent of revenue compared to 33.1 percent for the same period last year reflecting the Companys actions to proactively reduce expenses. For the fiscal year, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 32.1 percent versus 32.0 percent last year due primarily to increased investment in retail stores.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.8 percent compared to 24.3 percent for the same period last year. The fourth quarter tax rate was higher than the prior year due to the impact of the restructuring charges and one time benefits in the same period last year. For the fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 24.0 percent compared to 24.8 percent last year. This years tax rate was lower than fiscal 2008 due to the impact of the impairment of Umbros goodwill, intangible and other assets; and a lower on-going tax rate on operations outside the United States.
Balance Sheet Review
At the end of the fiscal year, global inventories stood at $2.4 billion, down 3 percent from May 31, 2008. Cash and short-term investments at year-end were $3.5 billion, 24 percent higher than $2.8 billion last year.
Share Repurchase
The Company did not purchase any shares during the fourth quarter. Under the Companys four-year, $3 billion share repurchase program, approved by the Board of Directors in June 2006, a total of 10.6 million shares for approximately $639.0 million was purchased during the first two quarters of fiscal 2009. Program to date, the Company has purchased a total of 49.2 million shares for approximately $2.7 billion.

Some forward-looking statements in this release concern changes in futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and because a significant portion of the business does not report futures orders.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company took necessary steps to streamline its management structure and eliminate operational redundancies to enhance consumer focus, drive innovation more quickly to market, and establish a more scalable, long-term cost structure. As a result, the Company incurred a $195.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge primarily consisting of severance costs related to the workforce reduction.

The Company recorded a one-time non-cash impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce the carrying value of Umbros goodwill, indefinite-lived trademark and other assets. The impairment charge is a result of both the deteriorating global consumer markets, particularly in the United Kingdom which is Umbros primary market, and managements decision to adjust planned investment in the brand. In addition, the deterioration of the financial markets has reduced both the present value of future cash flows and the market value of comparable businesses.

The tax benefit realized during fiscal 2008 relates to steps taken to realize losses generated by several international entities for which we had not previously recognized the offsetting tax benefits because the realization of those benefits was uncertain. The necessary steps to realize those tax benefits were taken during the year ended May 31, 2008 resulting in a one-time reduction of the effective tax rate.
