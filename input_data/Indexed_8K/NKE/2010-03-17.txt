Income Statement Review
In the third quarter of fiscal 2010 gross margins were 46.9 percent compared to 43.9 percent for the same period last year. Gross margins for the quarter were higher than the prior year primarily due to improved in-line product margins, less discounted close-out sales and favorable changes in product mix.
Third quarter selling and administrative expenses grew 16 percent to $1.6 billion.  Selling and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher than the same period last year mainly due to the timing of demand creation spending, investments in Company owned retail and higher costs for performance-based compensation.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.0 percent compared to a negative 3.6 percent for the same period last year. Excluding the tax effect of the charge for the impairment of Umbro assets, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 would have been 23.9 percent.
