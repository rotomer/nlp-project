Income Statement Review
For both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, gross margins improved. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 gross margins were 47.4 percent compared to 43.4 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal year, gross margins were 46.3 percent compared to 44.9 percent last year. Gross margins for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were higher than the prior year primarily due to improved in-line product margins, fewer close-out sales, and growth and improved profitability of owned retail and Other Businesses.
Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses grew 25 percent to $1.7 billion. Selling and administrative expenses for the quarter were higher than the same period last year mainly due to higher demand creation spending, which increased 43 percent to $666 million, and increasing operational overhead spending that rose 16 percent to $1.1 billion reflecting investments in Company owned retail and higher costs for performance-based compensation. For the full fiscal year, selling and administrative expenses were up 3 percent to $6.3 billion. Full fiscal year demand creation spending was relatively flat to the prior year at $2.4 billion while operational overhead spending increased 5 percent to $4.0 billion mainly due to investments in Company owned retail and higher costs for performance-based compensation.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6 percent compared to 29.8 percent for the same period last year. For the fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 24.2 percent compared to 24.0 percent last year. Excluding the tax effect of the charge for the impairment of Umbro assets, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 26.5 percent.

At the end of the fiscal year, global inventories stood at $2.0 billion, down 13 percent from May 31, 2009. Cash and short-term investments at year-end were $5.1 billion, $1.7 billion or 49 percent higher than last year.
