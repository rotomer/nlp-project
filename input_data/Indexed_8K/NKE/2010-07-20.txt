1.1             Except as provided in this Section 1 or in Section 6.2, the Option may not be exercised unless at the time of exercise the Optionee is employed by or in the service of the Company and shall have been so employed or provided such service continuously since the Grant Date.

The term total disability means a medically determinable mental or physical impairment that is expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of 12 months or more and that, in the opinion of the Company and two independent physicians, causes the Optionee to be unable to perform duties as an employee, director, officer or consultant of the Employer and unable to be engaged in any substantial gainful activity.

Failure to Exercise Option.
 
2.           The Option may be exercised only by notice in writing from the Optionee to the Company, or a broker designated by the Company, of the Optionees binding commitment to purchase shares, specifying the number of shares the Optionee desires to purchase under the Option and the date on which the Optionee agrees to complete the transaction and, if required to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, containing a representation that it is the Optionees intention to acquire the shares for investment and not with a view to distribution (the Exercise Notice).  On or before the date specified for completion of the purchase, the Optionee must pay the Company the full purchase price of those shares by either of, or a combination of, the following methods at the election of the Optionee:  (a) cash payment by wire transfer; or (b) delivery of an Exercise Notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale proceeds required to pay the full purchase price.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, no shares shall be issued upon exercise of an Option until full payment for the shares has been made, including all amounts owed for tax withholding as discussed in Section 4 below.
Method of Exercise of Option.
 
3.             The Option is nonassignable and nontransferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the Optionees domicile at the time of death, and during the Optionees lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by the Optionee.

The Optionee shall, immediately upon notification of the amount due, if any, pay to the Company by wire transfer, or irrevocably instruct a broker to pay from stock sales proceeds, amounts necessary to satisfy any applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.  If additional withholding is or becomes required (as a result of exercise of the Option or as a result of disposition of shares acquired pursuant to exercise of the Option) beyond any amount deposited before delivery of the certificates, the Optionee shall pay such amount to the Company, by wire transfer, on demand.  If the Optionee fails to pay the amount demanded, the Company or the Employer may withhold that amount from other amounts payable to the Optionee, including salary, subject to applicable law.
Responsibility for Taxes.
 
5.             If the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares, appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Committee in the number and kind of shares subject to the Option, and the purchase price for shares subject to the Option, so that the Optionees proportionate interest before and after the occurrence of the event is maintained.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have no obligation to effect any adjustment that would or might result in the issuance of fractional shares, and any fractional shares resulting from any adjustment may be disregarded or provided for in any manner determined by the Committee.

Appendix
 
19.           .  The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements upon the Optionees participation in the Plan, on the Option and on any shares of Class B Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan, and to require the Optionee to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
Imposition of Other Requirements
 
20.             This Agreement, including the Appendix, constitutes the entire agreement between the Optionee and the Company, both oral and written concerning the matters addressed herein, except with regard to the imposition of other requirements as described under Section 19 above, and all prior agreements or representations concerning the matters addressed herein, whether written or oral, express or implied, are terminated and of no further effect.
Complete Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern Options for Optionees residing outside of the United States and in one of the countries listed herein.  Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Appendix but defined in the Agreement shall have the same definitions as in the Agreement.
 
This Appendix also includes information regarding certain issues of which the Optionee should be aware with respect to participation in the Plan.  The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of July 2010.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Optionee not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the Optionee exercises the Option or sells shares of Class B Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option.
 
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Optionees particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure the Optionee of a particular result.  Accordingly, the Optionee is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Optionees country may apply to a particular situation.
 
Further, if the Optionee is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Optionee is currently working, the information contained herein may not be applicable.
 
Finally, the Company may, at any time and at its own discretion, restrict the available methods of exercising the Option/paying the purchase price or direct the repatriation of the proceeds of the sale of shares of Class B Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option to facilitate compliance with any tax, securities or other relevant laws in the Optionees country.
 
 
 
 
The following additional terms and conditions apply to the Option if the Optionee is a resident of any country other than the United States at the time of grant, vesting or exercise of the Option.  Additional country-specific terms and conditions that apply to the Option if the Optionee is a resident of the particular country begin on page APP-6.
 
1.             Notwithstanding Section 1 of Exhibit A to the Agreement, in the event of termination of the Optionees employment or service (whether or not in breach of local labor laws):
Active Employment.
 
1.1           the Optionees right to vest in the Option, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Optionee is no longer actively employed or in service,
 
1.2           the Optionees right to exercise the Option after termination of employment or service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of active employment or service, and
 
1.3           neither the right to vest nor the right to exercise will be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment or service would not include a period of garden leave or similar period pursuant to local law).
 
The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Optionee is no longer actively employed or in service for purposes of the Option.
 
2.             This provision replaces Section 4 of Exhibit A to the Agreement.
Responsibility for Taxes.
 
Regardless of any action the Companyor the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Optionees participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Optionee or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to the Optionee even if technically due by theCompany or the Employer (Tax-Related Items), the Optionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Optionees responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.  The Optionee further acknowledges that theCompany and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the issuance of shares of Class B Common Stock upon exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares of Class B Common Stock acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionees liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Optionee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Optionee acknowledges that theCompanyand/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax-withholding event, as applicable, the Optionee will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to theCompany and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares, for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Optionees participation in the Plan.
 
Finally, the Optionee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Optionees participation in the Plan that are not, in the discretion of the Company or the Employer, satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Class B Common Stock, if the Optionee fails to comply with the Optionees obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
 
3.             In accepting this Option grant, the Optionee acknowledges that:

3.1           the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time;
 
3.2           the grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Options, or benefits in lieu of Options, even if Options have been granted repeatedly in the past;

The Optionee should be aware of the Dutch insider-trading rules, which may impact the sale of shares of Class B Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Option.  In particular, the Optionee may be prohibited from effectuating certain transactions if he or she has inside information about the Company.
Securities Law Information.
 
 
Under Article 5:56 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, anyone who has insider information related to an issuing company is prohibited from effectuating a transaction in securities in or from the Netherlands.  Inside information is defined as knowledge of specific information concerning the issuing company to which the securities relate or the trade in securities issued by such company, which has not been made public and which, if published, would reasonably be expected to affect the share price, regardless of the development of the price.  The insider could be any employee of the Company or a subsidiary in the Netherlands who has inside information as described herein.
 
Given the broad scope of the definition of inside information, an Optionee working at a subsidiary or affiliate in the Netherlands may have inside information and, thus, would be prohibited from effectuating a transaction in securities in the Netherlands at a time when he or she has such inside information.
 
If the Optionee is uncertain whether the insider-trading rules apply to him or her, then the Optionee should consult with his or her personal legal advisor.
 
 
The Optionee will receive the following documents (in addition to this Appendix) in connection with the Option grant:
Securities Law Notification.  
 
(i)           an Agreement which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Option grant;

The shares of Class B Common Stock are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The Optionees designated broker should be able to assist the Optionee in the sale of shares of Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Optionee is required to retain the documents connected with a foreign exchange transaction for a period of five (5) years, as measured from the end of the year in which such transaction occurred.

  This Appendix, the Agreement, the Plan and all other materials that the Optionee may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities in Russia.

Securities Law Notification.
 
  In order to perform a cash exercise of the Option, the Optionee must remit the funds from a foreign currency account at an authorized bank in Russia.  This requirement does not apply if the Optionee uses a cashless method of exercise, such that there is no remittance of funds out of Russia.
Exchange Control Information.
 
Under current exchange control regulations, within a reasonably short time after sale of the shares acquired upon exercise of the Option, the Optionee must repatriate the sale proceeds to Russia.  Such sale proceeds must be initially credited to the Optionee through a foreign currency account at an authorized bank in Russia.  After the sale proceeds are initially received in Russia, they may be further remitted to foreign banks in accordance with Russian exchange control laws.  If the Optionee exercises his or her Option through a cashless sell-all method of exercise (whereby the Optionee instructs the broker to sell all of the shares issued upon exercise of his or her Option, use the proceeds to pay the purchase price, brokerage fees and any Tax-Related Items and remit the balance in cash to the Optionee), to the extent that the Optionee receives the exercise proceeds through the Optionees local payroll, the requirement to credit the proceeds through a Russian authorized bank will not apply to the Optionee.
 
The Optionee is encouraged to contact his or her personal advisor before remitting the Optionees sale proceeds to Russia as exchange control requirements may change.
 
 
The Options were granted to the Optionee pursuant to the Qualifying Person exemption under section 273(1)(f) of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, 2006 Ed.) (SFA).

Nature of Grant.  
 
In accepting the Option, the Optionee consents to participate in the Plan and acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Plan.
 
The Optionee understands that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and discretionally decided to grant stock options under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate.  Consequently, the Optionee understands that the Option is granted on the assumption and condition that the Option and any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option are not part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, the Optionee understands that the Option would not be granted to the Optionee but for the assumptions and conditions referred to herein; thus, the Optionee acknowledges and freely accepts that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, then the grant of this Option shall be null and void.
 
This Option is a conditional right to shares of Class B Common Stock and can be forfeited in the case of, or affected by, the Optionees termination of employment.  This will be the case, for example, even if (1) the Optionee is considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause; (2) the Optionee is dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) the Optionee terminates employment due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition; (4) the Optionee terminates employment due to unilateral breach of contract of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (5) the Optionees employment terminates for any other reason whatsoever, except for reasons specified in Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, or 1.6 of Exhibit A to the Agreement.  Consequently, upon termination of the Optionees employment for any of the reasons set forth above, the Optionee may automatically lose any rights to the unvested Options granted to him or her as of the date of the Optionees termination of employment, as described in Exhibit A to the Agreement.
 
The Optionee must declare the acquisition of shares to the (the DGPCIE) of the for statistical purposes.

.The following provision supplements Section 2 of Exhibit A to the Agreement and Section 2 of the Additional Terms For All Non-U.S. Optionees in this Appendix:
Method of Exercise
 
 
Due to regulatory requirements, the Optionee understands that the Optionee will be restricted to the cashless sell-all method of exercise.  To complete a cashless sell-all exercise, the Optionee understands that the Optionee needs to instruct his or her broker to:  (i) sell all of the shares issued upon exercise; (ii) use the proceeds to pay the purchase price, brokerage fees and any applicable Tax-Related Items; and (iii) remit the balance in cash to the Optionee.  The Optionee will not be permitted to hold shares after exercise.  Depending on the development of local laws or the Optionees country of residence, the Company reserves the right to modify the methods of exercising the Option and, in its sole discretion, to permit cash exercise, cashless sell-to cover exercise or any other method of exercise and payment of Tax-Related Items permitted under the Agreement.
 
 
There are no country specific provisions.
 
 
If the Optionee remits funds out of Thailand to exercise his or her Option, it is the Optionees responsibility to comply with applicable exchange control laws.  Under current exchange control regulations, Optionee may remit funds out of Thailand up to U.S.$1,000,000 per year to purchase shares (and otherwise invest in securities abroad) by submitting an application to an authorized agent, (i.e., a commercial bank authorized by the Bank of Thailand to engage in the purchase, exchange and withdrawal of foreign currency).  The application includes the Foreign Exchange Transaction Form, a letter describing the Option, a copy of the Plan and related documents, and evidence showing the nexus between the Company and the Employer.  If the Optionee uses a cashless method of exercise that does not involve remitting funds out of Thailand, this requirement does not apply.
Exchange Control Information.  
 
When the Optionee sells shares issued upon exercise of the Option, the Optionee must repatriate all cash proceeds to Thailand and then convert such proceeds to Thai Baht within 360 days of repatriation.  If the amount of the Optionees proceeds is US$20,000 or more, the Optionee must specifically report the inward remittance to the Bank of Thailand on a foreign exchange transaction form.  If the Optionee fails to comply with these obligations, the Optionee may be subject to penalties assessed by the Bank of Thailand.
 
The Optionee should consult his or her personal advisor prior to taking any action with respect to remittance of proceeds from the sale of shares into Thailand.  The Optionee is responsible for ensuring compliance with all exchange control laws in Thailand.
 
 
  Exchange control regulations require Turkish residents to purchase securities through financial intermediary institutions that are approved under the Capital Market Law (, banks licensed in Turkey).  Therefore, if the Optionee exercises his or her Option using a cash exercise method, the funds must be remitted through a bank or other financial institution licensed in Turkey.  A wire transfer of funds by a Turkish bank will satisfy this requirement.  This requirement does not apply to a cashless exercise, as no funds are remitted out of Turkey.

i.e.
 
 
  The following provisions supplement Section 2 of the Additional Terms For All Non-U.S. Optionees in this Appendix:
Tax Obligations.
 
The Optionee agrees that, if Optionee does not pay or the Employer or the Company does not withhold from the Optionee the full amount of Tax-Related Items that the Optionee owes at exercise of the Option, or the release or assignment of the Option for consideration, or the receipt of any other benefit in connection with the Option (the Taxable Event) within 90 days after the Taxable Event, or such other period specified in section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, then the amount that should have been withheld shall constitute a loan owed by the Optionee to the Employer, effective 90 days after the Taxable Event.  The Optionee agrees that the loan will bear interest at the HMRCs official rate and will be immediately due and repayable by the Optionee, and the Company and/or the Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by withholding the funds from salary, bonus or any other funds due to the Optionee by the Employer, by withholding in shares issued upon exercise of the Option or from the cash proceeds from the sale of shares or by demanding cash or a check from the Optionee. The Optionee also authorizes the Company to delay the issuance of any shares unless and until the loan is repaid in full.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee is an officer or executive director (as within the meaning of section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), the terms of the immediately foregoing provision will not apply.  In the event that the Optionee is an officer or executive director and Tax-Related Items are not collected from or paid by the Optionee within 90 days of the Taxable Event, the amount of any uncollected Tax-Related Items may constitute a benefit to the Optionee on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be payable.  The Optionee acknowledges that the Company or the Employer may recover any such additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 2 of the Additional Terms For All Non-U.S. Optionees in this Appendix, although the Optionee acknowledges that he/she ultimately will be responsible for reporting any income tax or National Insurance Contributions due on this additional benefit directly to the HMRC under the self-assessment regime.

3.           .  If the Recipient ceases to be employed by or in the service of the Company for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause, any Restricted Shares that did not vest pursuant to Section 2 above at or prior to the time of such termination of employment or service shall be forfeited to the Company; provided, however, that if the Recipients employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Recipient for Good Reason after Shareholder Approval but before a Change in Control, any Restricted Shares that are forfeited under this sentence shall be restored to the Recipient and vested if a Change in Control subsequently occurs within one year.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon Recipient any right to be employed by the Company or any Employer or to continue to provide services to the Company or any Employer or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Employer to terminate Recipients services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.
Forfeiture Restriction
4.           .  The Recipient shall not sell, assign, pledge, or in any manner transfer unvested Restricted Shares, or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the Recipients domicile at the time of death.  Any sale or transfer, or purported sale or transfer, of unvested Restricted Shares, or any right or interest in unvested Restricted Shares, in violation of this Section 4 shall be null and void.
Restriction on Transfer
5.           .  Recipient acknowledges that, on the date (the Vesting Date) any portion of the Restricted Shares vests, the Value (as defined below) on that date of such vested Restricted Shares will be treated as ordinary compensation income for federal and state income and FICA tax purposes, and that the Company will be required to withhold taxes on this income amount.  To satisfy the required withholding amount, Recipient shall surrender to the Company the number of vested Restricted Shares having a Value equal to the required withholding amount, and the Company shall have the right to cancel such number of vested Restricted Shares without any further action by Recipient before delivering the balance of the vested Restricted Shares to Recipient in accordance with Section 7.  For purposes of this Section 5, the Value of a Restricted Share shall be equal to the closing market price for Class B Common Stock on the last trading day preceding the Vesting Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may elect with respect to any Vesting Date to pay withholding taxes in cash instead of having vested Restricted Shares withheld to cover taxes by giving notice to the Company in writing at least 15 days prior to the Vesting Date, in which case no vested Restricted Shares shall be delivered to Recipient until Recipient shall have paid to the Company in cash any required tax withholding.  
Tax Withholding
Recipient agrees not to file with respect to any Restricted Shares any election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
6.           .  Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the award of the Restricted Shares shall be completed and, except as limited by this Agreement, the Recipient shall be the owner of the Restricted Shares with all rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and to receive ordinary dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Shares from the date of this Agreement.  Until the Restricted Shares become vested, they will not be treated as issued shares for federal income tax purposes and dividends paid to the Recipient with respect to the Restricted Shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as additional compensation subject to applicable withholding.
Rights as Shareholder; Dividends
7.           .  To secure the rights of the Company under Sections 3 and 5, the Company will retain the certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Shares.  Upon any forfeiture of the Restricted Shares covered by this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to cancel the Restricted Shares in accordance with this Agreement without any further action by the Recipient.  After Restricted Shares have vested and all required withholding has been paid to the Company in connection with such vesting, the Company shall deliver a certificate for the remaining vested Restricted Shares to the Recipient.
Stock Certificate
8.           .  If, prior to vesting of Restricted Shares, the outstanding Class B Common Stock is increased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company or of another corporation as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of exchange, recapitalization or reclassification, the restrictions and other provisions of this Agreement shall apply to any such additional shares of Class B Common Stock or other shares or securities which are issued in respect of the Restricted Shares to the same extent as such restrictions and other provisions apply to the Restricted Shares.

Exhibit 10.3
 
If NIKE, Inc. (the Company) is required to prepare an accounting restatement for any fiscal quarter or year commencing after May 31, 2010 due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement, and the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) determines that the Misconduct (as defined below) of any person who was an executive officer of the Company at the time of the Misconduct (an Affected Officer) contributed to the noncompliance which resulted in the obligation to restate the Companys financial statements, the Board of Directors may require the Affected Officer to repay to the Company all or part of the following:
 
(a)           the full amount of any bonus received by the Affected Officer under the Companys Executive Performance Sharing Plan (PSP) that was calculated based on the financial statements that were subsequently restated;
 
(b)           the full amount of any payout received by the Affected Officer under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) with respect to an award granted after May 31, 2010 that was calculated in whole or in part based on the financial statements that were subsequently restated;
 
(c)           the full amount of any Profit Sharing Make Up Contribution (as defined in the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP)) credited to the account of the Affected Officer under the DCP with respect to the fiscal year for which financial statements were subsequently restated; and
 
(d)           if, after the release of earnings for any period with respect to which financial statements were subsequently restated and prior to the announcement of such restatement, the Affected Officer sold any shares of Company common stock acquired pursuant to an option or other award granted after May 31, 2010 under the Companys 1990 Stock Incentive Plan, the excess of (i) the actual aggregate sales proceeds from the Affected Officers sale of those shares, over (ii) the aggregate sales proceeds the Affected Officer would have received from the sale of those shares at a price per share determined appropriate by the Board in its discretion to reflect what the Companys common stock price would have been if the restatement had occurred prior to such sales; provided, however, that the aggregate sales proceeds determined by the Board under this clause (ii) with respect to shares acquired upon exercise of an option shall not be less than the aggregate exercise price paid for those shares.
 
Misconduct shall mean willful commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty or recklessness in the performance of a persons duties.  If an amount repaid to the Company under this Policy will not be fully deductible by the Affected Officer, the Board shall reduce the amount to be repaid by the amount determined by the Board to reasonably take into account the tax consequences of such repayment.
 
If any portion of a PSP or LTIP payout was deferred under the DCP, any amount to be repaid with respect to that payout shall first be recovered by canceling the amount so deferred under the DCP and any investment returns credited under the DCP with respect to such cancelled amount.  Similarly, any Profit Sharing Make Up Contribution under the DCP that is required to be repaid shall be recovered by canceling such amount and any investment returns credited under the DCP with respect to such cancelled amount.  The Company may seek direct repayment from the Affected Officer of any amount not so recovered and may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, offset such amount against any compensation or other amounts owed by the Company to the Affected Officer.  In particular, amounts to be repaid under this Policy may be recovered by offset against the after-tax proceeds of deferred compensation payouts under the DCP at the times such deferred compensation payouts occur under the terms of the DCP.  Any amount that remains unpaid for more than 30 days after demand by the Company shall accrue interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per year, compounded at the end of each calendar quarter, until paid.
