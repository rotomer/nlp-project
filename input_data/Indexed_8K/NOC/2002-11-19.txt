Closing Statement
 
(d) The parties hereto agree that the sole purpose of the purchase price adjustment contemplated by this Section 3.2 is to measure the effect on working capital of operating activity and transactions and to measure changes in Adjusting Indebtedness that have occurred between September 30, 2002 and the Closing Date. The purchase price adjustment is not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodology for purposes of determining the asset and liability balances from those used in the preparation of the Financial Statements to the extent the same are consistent with GAAP (except as disclosed in the footnotes thereto). Each party will provide the other party and its representatives with reasonable access to books and records and relevant personnel during the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the resolution of any disputes that may arise under this Section 3.2.
 
(e) If Northrop Grumman disagrees with the determination of the Closing Working Capital or the Closing Adjusting Indebtedness as shown on the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance Sheet, Northrop Grumman shall notify Parent in writing of such disagreement within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet (together with all work papers and other supporting documentation and schedules used in the preparation thereof), which notice will describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each such disagreement and provide reasonable supporting documentation for each such disagreement. After the end of such 60-day period, Northrop Grumman may not introduce additional disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement and any item not so identified will be deemed to be agreed to by Northrop Grumman and will be final and binding upon the parties. Similarly, a disagreement by Northrop Grumman does not provide any right to Parent to introduce any changes to the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement not directly related to the disputed item. During the 60-day period of its review, Northrop Grumman shall have reasonable access to any additional documents, schedules or workpapers and to accounting personnel of the Company as it may reasonably request.
 
(f) BCP and Northrop Grumman agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing will be final and binding upon the parties and their successors and assigns. If the parties are unable to resolve all disagreements properly identified by Northrop Grumman pursuant to Section 3.2(e) within sixty (60) days after delivery to Parent of written notice of such disagreement, then the disputed matters will be referred to the Chief Financial Officers or other substantially equivalent executive officers of the respective businesses for resolution. If the Chief Financial Officers or other substantially equivalent executive officers are unable to resolve all disagreements within fifteen (15) days after referral of such disagreement, then, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, the matter will be referred for final determination to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. If such firm is unable to serve,
the parties shall jointly select an arbiter from an internationally recognized accounting firm that is not affiliated with the independent auditor of either Parent or Northrop Grumman or their respective Affiliates; if the parties are unable to select such an arbiter within such time period, the American Arbitration Association will make such selection (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or any other Person so selected will be referred to herein as the ""). The Accounting Arbitrator so selected shall only consider those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement as to which the parties have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with applicable Law and the terms and provisions of the Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to the parties, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. With respect to each item of disagreement, the resolution shall be the arithmetic average of the Accounting Arbitrator's determination of the appropriate amount of such item and the position of either Parent or Northrop Grumman that is closest to the Accounting Arbitrator's determination on such disputed item. Such report will be non-appealable, final and binding upon Parent and Northrop Grumman to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may be enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by BCP and one-half by Northrop Grumman.

The TRW Automotive U.S. SPP shall be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Effective as of the date of transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(iii) (Delayed Transfer Date for Delayed Transfer Employees or Returned Transfer Date for Returned Transfer Employees), the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP shall credit each participant thereunder for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accruals and all other plan purposes with all service which had been credited to such participant for such purposes under the TRW SPP. Until the actual transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount, all benefits payable to Salaried Plan Participants (including benefits that have accrued under the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP following the Closing Date) shall be paid from the TRW Master Trust.
 
(b) Assumption of Pension Plan Liabilities. Effective as of the date of the actual transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount set forth in Section 3.1(c), the Company hereby agrees to cause the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP and the TRW Automotive Master Trust to assume, and to fully perform, pay and discharge, all accrued benefits of the TRW SPP and the TRW Master Trust relating to all Salaried Plan Participants as of the Closing Date (exclusive of benefits paid prior to the date of transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount), as well as all Liabilities for all participants under the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP which accrue from and after the Closing Date.

(c) Transfer of Pension Plan Assets.
 
(i) As soon as reasonably practical and at least 30 days prior to the transfers described in (iii) and (v) below, TRW and the Company shall, or shall cause one or more TRW Automotive Subsidiaries to, to the extent necessary, file with the IRS notice on IRS Form 5310-A regarding the transfer of assets and liabilities from the TRW SPP and the TRW Master Trust to the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP and the TRW Automotive Master Trust. No transfer shall be made under this paragraph (c) unless and until TRW has received from the Company or the TRW Automotive Subsidiaries (A) evidence reasonably satisfactory to TRW that the Company or the TRW Automotive Subsidiaries have completed all governmental filings or submissions needed in order for the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP to receive a transfer of assets from the TRW SPP and (B) either a current and valid IRS determination letter with respect to the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP or a representation by the Company that the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP is designed to qualify and that the Company shall, or shall cause one or more TRW Automotive Subsidiaries to, timely make all filings necessary to obtain such qualification and make any and all necessary amendments on a retroactive basis as are required by the IRS to obtain such qualification.
 
(ii) The TRW Actuary shall determine the amount of assets to be transferred to the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP (the "TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount") in respect of the Liabilities with respect to Salaried Plan Participants assumed in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 411(d) and 414(l) and Treasury Regulations issued thereunder and actuarial methods and assumptions established by the PBGC under ERISA Section 4044 and in effect for plans terminating on the Closing Date and, with respect to any actuarial methods and assumptions not required under ERISA Section 4044, the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the 2002 valuation for the TRW SPP as reflected on Schedule B of the TRW SPP Form 5500. The applicable ERISA Section 4044 assumptions are set forth in the attached Schedule 3.1(c)(ii). The determination of the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount shall be made without regard to the assets held in the separate Code Section 401(h) account under the TRW SPP, which assets shall remain a separate account under the TRW SPP. The determination of the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount shall be made by including, for purposes of the ERISA Section 4044 allocation in the market value of TRW SPP assets, the accrued contribution obligation, if any, due September 15, 2003 with respect to the 2002 plan year, any unpaid minimum required Code section 412 quarterly contributions for 2003 calendar quarters ending prior to the Closing Date and any pro rata share of the minimum required Code section 412 quarterly contribution for the quarter in which the Closing Date occurs in accordance with a ratio equal to: (A) the number of days from the beginning of such quarter until the Closing Date; divided by (B) the total days in the quarter.
 
(iii) Within 90 days of Closing, TRW shall cause an initial transfer of assets from the TRW SPP to the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP in an amount equal to 80% of the then estimated TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount ("Initial Transfer Amount"), calculated without regard to Delayed Transfer Employees and Returned Transfer Employees.
 
(iv) Within 270 days of the Closing Date, TRW will provide the Company with an updated calculation of the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount (including Delayed Transfer Employees but excluding Returned Transfer Employees). The Company may submit the TRW Actuary's determination of the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount to the TRW Automotive Actuary for verification, which shall relate only to the calculation of the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount on the basis of the assumptions and methods set forth above. The Company shall pay the cost of the TRW Automotive Actuary. The TRW Actuary and the TRW Automotive Actuary shall make a good faith attempt to reconcile any difference in their calculations. If the TRW Automotive Actuary's calculation is within five percent (5%) of the TRW Actuary's calculation of the TRW Automotive US SPP Transfer Amount, the average of the TRW Actuary's calculation and the TRW Automotive Actuary's calculation shall be used. If the difference cannot be reconciled and exceeds five percent (5%), the TRW Actuary and the TRW Automotive Actuary shall jointly designate a third independent actuary whose verification shall be final and binding, but not greater than the calculation of the TRW Automotive Actuary or less than the calculation of the TRW Actuary. The Company and TRW shall each pay one-half the costs of such third actuary.
 
(v) Within sixty (60) days after completion of the final verification, TRW or the Company, as applicable, shall cause an additional transfer of assets from the TRW SPP to the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP (or from the TRW Automotive U.S. SPP to the TRW SPP, as applicable) in an amount equal to the verified TRW Automotive U.S. SPP Transfer Amount less (A) the Initial Transfer Amount and (B) benefit payments made from the TRW SPP to TRW Automotive Participants from the Closing Date to the date of the transfer contemplated in this subsection (v) ("True-Up Amount").
 
(vi) Both the Initial Transfer Amount in (iii) and the True-Up Amount in (v) shall be paid from the TRW Master Trust to the TRW Automotive Trust, together with interest from the Closing Date until the asset transfer at the actual rate of return of the TRW Master Trust. Assets to be transferred pursuant to this Section 3.1(e) shall consist of a proportionate interest in all investments under the TRW Master Trust, cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities, excepting real estate. The proportionate share of assets attributable to real estate shall be replaced with cash or cash equivalents.

The New Macon Plan shall be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and shall credit each participant thereunder with service for all purposes as had been credited to them under the Fasteners Plan. As soon as practicable thereafter, the TRW Automotive Actuary shall determine the amount of assets to be transferred to the New Macon Plan in respect of Liabilities with respect to individuals who previously participated in the Macon Plan assumed in accordance with the requirements of Section 411(d) and 414(l) of the
Code (and regulations thereunder), and actuarial methods and assumptions established by the PBGC under ERISA Section 4044 and in effect for plans terminating on the date of spin-off and, with respect to any actuarial methods and assumptions not required under ERISA Section 4044, the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the 2002 valuation for the Fasteners Plan as reflected on Schedule B for the Fasteners Plan Form 5500. The applicable ERISA 4044 assumptions are set forth in the attached Schedule 3.1(c)(ii). TRW may submit the TRW Automotive Actuary's determination of the amount of the asset transfer to the TRW Actuary for verification, which shall relate only to the calculation of the amount of the asset transfer on the basis of the assumptions and methods set forth above. TRW shall pay the cost of the TRW Actuary. The TRW Actuary and the TRW Automotive Actuary shall make a good faith attempt to reconcile any difference in their calculations. If the TRW Actuary's calculation is within five percent (5%) of the TRW Automotive Actuary's calculation of the amount of the asset transfer, the average of the TRW Actuary's calculation and the TRW Automotive Actuary's calculation shall be used. If the difference cannot be reconciled and exceeds five percent (5%), the TRW Actuary and the TRW Automotive Actuary shall jointly designate a third independent actuary whose verification shall be final and binding, but not greater than the calculation of the TRW Actuary or less than the calculation of the TRW Automotive Actuary. The Company and TRW shall each pay one-half the costs of such third actuary. From the date of the transfer of Fasteners Plan assets under (iii) immediately below and until the actual transfer to the TRW Master Trust of the assets allocated to the New Macon Plan under the TRW Automotive Master Trust, all benefits payable to participants under such plan shall be paid from the TRW Automotive Master Trust.

(iii) Transfer of Assets. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, TRW shall cause the trustee of the TRW Master Trust to transfer assets to the TRW Automotive Master Trust in an amount equal to the aggregate of the fair market value of the units of each of the TRW Hourly Pension Plans in the TRW Master Trust as of the Closing Date, together with interest from the Closing Date until the asset transfer at the actual rate of return of the TRW Master Trust. Assets to be transferred pursuant to this Section 3.2 (b) shall consist of a proportionate interest in the real estate investments under the TRW Master Trust, cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN TO SELL
TRW'S AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS TO THE BLACKSTONE GROUP
 
LOS ANGELES  Nov. 19, 2002  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell the Automotive business ("TRW Automotive") of TRW Inc. (NYSE: TRW) to The Blackstone Group in a deal that values TRW Automotive at $4.725 billion.
 
The Blackstone Group, a leading private investment firm, recently raised the world's largest private equity fund at $6.45 billion, and the purchase of TRW Automotive will be the first investment made by this fund.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, which is conditioned on the closing of the Northrop Grumman/TRW merger, the seller will receive $4.725 billion, comprised of $3.757 billion in cash, $600 million in debt securities and an initial $368 million equity interest (approximately 42 percent of total equity of $868 million) in TRW Automotive. The parties intend to reduce their initial equity positions in TRW Automotive before closing.

At the close of the transaction, anticipated to be in the first quarter of 2003, the seller's equity interest is expected to be approximately 20 percent, which would increase total cash consideration to between $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion. Cash proceeds from the sale of TRW Automotive, along with the proceeds already received from the completed sale of TRW Aeronautical Systems, will be used to pay down debt. All financing necessary to complete the transaction has been provided by JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Brothers.
 
"We're very pleased to announce the sale of TRW Automotive. As we've maintained, Northrop Grumman's strategic interest is in TRW's space, electronics and systems businesses," said Kent Kresa, Northrop Grumman's chairman and chief executive officer. "We believe that our agreement with Blackstone is an attractive transaction for our shareholders and will allow our management team to quickly focus its full attention on integrating TRW's superior space and defense assets into our portfolio."
 
Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman's president and chief operating officer, added, "We look forward to benefiting from TRW's strong defense operations once the TRW merger is complete. In addition, we are pleased to be working on this transaction with Blackstone, which has a long history of making successful equity investments, including those in the automotive parts sector. Moreover, the separation provides a great opportunity for the employees of TRW Automotive to flourish as part of a new, focused stand-alone company."
 
Stephen A. Schwarzman, president and chief executive officer of The Blackstone Group, said, "We are delighted to reach agreement with Northrop Grumman on this transaction. TRW Automotive is a leading global automotive supplier which enjoys a
