Item 7.    Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits
 
(b)  Pro Forma Financial Information
 
Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman"), a Delaware corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 30, 2002, by and among TRW Inc. ("TRW"), an Ohio corporation, Northrop Grumman and Richmond Acquisition Corp., an Ohio corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. Pursuant to the merger agreement, on December 11, 2002, Richmond Acquisition Corp. was merged with and into TRW, with TRW surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.
 
On November 18, 2002, Northrop Grumman and BCP Acquisition Company L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a Master Purchase Agreement dated as of such date (the "Master Purchase Agreement") providing for the purchase and sale of TRW's automotive business ("TRW Automotive").
 
In April 2001, Northrop Grumman acquired approximately 97.3% of the outstanding Common Shares of Litton Industries, Inc. ("Litton") and 58.6% of the preferred stock of Litton. Northrop Grumman subsequently acquired the remaining Common and Preferred Shares of Litton for cash and now owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Litton.
 
In November 2001, Northrop Grumman acquired approximately 80.7% of the outstanding shares of Newport News Shipbuilding, Inc. ("Newport News") common stock. On January 18, 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired the remaining shares and now owns 100% of Newport News.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented herein are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Northrop Grumman, Litton, Newport News and TRW, and have been adjusted to give effect to Northrop Grumman's acquisitions of Litton, Newport News, TRW, TRW's sale of its Aeronautical Systems business to Goodrich Corporation and Northrop Grumman's planned divestiture of TRW Automotive. The pro forma statements contained herein use the purchase method of accounting, with Northrop Grumman treated as the acquirer and as if the Litton, Newport News and TRW acquisitions, the divestiture of TRW's Aeronautical Systems business and Northrop Grumman's planned divestiture of TRW Automotive had been completed on January 1, 2001 (for statement of income purposes) and on September 30, 2002 (for the statement of financial position). Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings resulting from acquisitions, or recognition of liabilities associated with potential restructurings.
 
Northrop Grumman Corporation and Subsidiaries
 
With the exception of preliminary estimates of the fair market value of TRW's retiree benefits assets and liabilities, Northrop Grumman has not performed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair market value of TRW assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has Northrop Grumman identified the adjustments, if any, necessary to conform the TRW data to Northrop Grumman's accounting policies. Accordingly, Northrop Grumman has used the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of TRW and has used the historical revenue recognition policies of TRW to prepare the unaudited pro forma financial data, with the excess of the purchase price over the historical net assets of TRW recorded as goodwill and other purchased intangibles. Once Northrop Grumman has determined the final purchase price, has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any necessary conforming changes for TRW, any adjustments will be reflected in future filings. There can be no assurance that such adjustments will not be material. Northrop Grumman expects to complete the sale of TRW Automotive in accordance with The Master Purchase Agreement currently in place, in the first quarter of 2003.
 
The pro forma amounts presented herein have been developed from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of Northrop Grumman contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 adjusted to reflect the discontinuance of the Component Technologies sector and the sale of the Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays businesses, (ii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Litton's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2001, (iii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Newport News contained in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 16, 2001, (iv) the audited consolidated financial statements of TRW for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 which are contained in its Form 8-K filed on September 3, 2002 (which contains restated financial statements of TRW for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 to give effect to the sale of the Aeronautical Systems business to Goodrich Corporation and the reporting of that business as a discontinued operation), (v) Northrop Grumman's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 which reflected the discontinuance of the Component Technologies sector and the sale of the Electron Devices and Ruggedized Displays businesses and (vi) TRW's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2002. Northrop Grumman is currently reviewing preliminary accounting conformance adjustments and preliminary estimates of the fair market value of the Newport News assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including valuations associated with certain contracts, legal contingencies, and property, plant and equipment, as well as valuation studies for retiree benefits assets and liabilities. The final determination of the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the final allocation of the purchase price are expected to be finalized within one year of the date of the Newport News acquisition and will be reflected in future filings. The final determinations may result in amounts which are materially different from the amounts reflected in the pro forma data presented herein and are subject to adjustment pending such final determinations. The financial statement information of Northrop Grumman included herein as part of the basis of these pro forma amounts does not reflect purchase accounting adjustments finalized subsequent to September 30, 2002, which relate to previous acquisitions. Such adjustments will be reflected in future filings.
 
The pro forma amounts presented also give effect to (a) the sale by TRW of its Aeronautical Systems business on October 1, 2002 for a gross purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash and (b) the planned divestiture of TRW Automotive upon the completion of the sale transaction for cash proceeds of $3.7 billion, stock in the surviving company estimated at $362 million and a sellers note at 8% interest with a face value of $ 600 million.
 
The acquisitions of Newport News and TRW by Northrop Grumman, the sale of TRW's Aeronautical Systems business to Goodrich Corporation on October 1, 2002 and the agreement to sell TRW Automotive are collectively referred to in these pro forma financial statements and the related notes as the "pro forma transactions." The unaudited pro forma financial statements and data contained herein are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of Northrop Grumman would have been had the pro forma transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Northrop Grumman Systems, Northrop Grumman, Litton, Newport News and TRW.
