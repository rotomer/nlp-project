Companywide, contract acquisitions increased 36 percent to $5.2 billion in the 2003 second quarter from $3.8 billion reported for the same period a year ago, primarily due to contributions from the Mission Systems and Space Technology segments. The company's business backlog increased 19 percent to $25.9 billion at June 30, 2003, from $21.7 billion reported a year earlier.
 
The 2003 second quarter results reflect contributions from the company's two new operating segments, Mission Systems and Space Technology, and double-digit growth in sales and operating margin at its Electronic Systems, Information Technology and Integrated Systems segments. The results also include a $68 million pre-tax charge on Ships' commercial Polar Tanker program.
 
Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman's chief executive officer and president said, "We are very pleased with the excellent operating results of all our defense and government businesses, reflecting the strength and depth of the new Northrop Grumman. Both heritage and recently acquired companies contributed significantly to today's results. Despite the charge on the Polar Tanker program, we were able to deliver a very strong quarter, including solid cash flow, and to increase 2003 earnings per share guidance.
 
"We are optimistic about Northrop Grumman's future growth and our ability to capitalize on the Department of Defense's 21
st
century transformation agenda. From the production of the most sophisticated sensors to the integration of systems-of-systemsfrom undersea to cyberspaceNorthrop Grumman is uniquely positioned to shape and support the network-centric warfare future envisioned by our customers," Sugar added.

July 21. The charge also includes increased estimates to complete the final two ships to reflect more modest improvements in labor productivity and higher overhead costs than previously expected.
