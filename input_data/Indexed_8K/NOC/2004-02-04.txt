Fourth Quarter 2003 Results
 
Total operating margin for the 2003 fourth quarter was $388 million compared with $411 million in the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter 2003 total operating margin includes pension expense determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of $145 million versus pension income of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) increased total operating margin by $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $26 million for the comparable 2002 period. Fourth quarter 2003 total operating margin includes a $40 million pre-tax charge in the Electronic Systems segment for projected cost growth in the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development program. The fourth quarter 2003 total operating margin also includes $72 million of unallocated corporate expenses compared with $22 million for the 2002 fourth quarter, reflecting increased legal costs and higher estimates of unrecoverable costs.
 
"Northrop Grumman's results represent another quarter of solid financial performance," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Our new Mission Systems and Space Technology businesses performed splendidly in their first year as part of Northrop Grumman, and our legacy businesses  Electronic Systems, Ships, Information Technology and Integrated Systems  achieved double-digit sales growth in 2003.
 
"We had several important program wins, including the Kinetic Energy Interceptor program that establishes Northrop Grumman as a prime contractor in national missile defense. We begin 2004 with a much stronger balance sheet, a solid outlook in sales and cash generation, and a $58 billion backlog of production and development programs. Going forward, we have the people, programs, and financial flexibility to increase shareholder value as we drive operational and financial performance."
 
Net income for the 2003 fourth quarter was $224 million, or $1.22 per share, compared with $224 million, or $1.72 per share for the same period of 2002. Fourth quarter 2003 net income includes a $22 million gain on the sale of discontinued operations.
 
Contract acquisitions were $10.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with $9.4 billion for the same period of 2002. Fourth quarter 2002 contract acquisitions

included approximately $4 billion of backlog acquired upon completion of the TRW acquisition. Total funded order backlog was $26.9 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with $26.1 billion at December 31, 2002. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $58.2 billion at December 31, 2003.
 
2003 Results
 
Sales for 2003 increased 52 percent to $26.2 billion from $17.2 billion in 2002, due to double-digit sales growth in Electronic Systems, Ships, Information Technology and Integrated Systems combined with the contributions of the Space Technology and Mission Systems segments acquired in December 2002. Total operating margin for 2003 was $1.5 billion compared with $1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Total operating margin in 2003 includes pension expense of $568 million compared with pension income of $90 million in 2002. CAS pension expense increased to $265 million in 2003 from $100 million for 2002.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of an accounting change totaled $808 million, or $4.32 per share, compared with $697 million, or $5.72 per share, for 2002. Net income for 2003 was $866 million, or $4.64 per share, compared with $64 million, or $.34 per share, for 2002. Last year's results included a $432 million charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change on January 1, 2002, to recognize the impairment of goodwill in the company's Component Technologies reporting units. Loss from discontinued operations included an additional goodwill impairment loss of $186 million recognized in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 184.2 million for 2003 and 117.4 million for 2002.
 
In accordance with SFAS No. 87  , the balance sheet was adjusted at December 31, 2003 to reverse a significant portion of the additional minimum pension liability. This nearly $1 billion non-cash, after-tax increase in shareholders' equity did not impact earnings. Based on expected long-term returns available in the capital markets and lower long-term interest rates, the 2004 pension plan assumptions have been changed from the 2003 assumptions. The 2004
Employers' Accounting for Pensions

assumptions include an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.75 percent and a discount rate of 6.25 percent compared with the 2003 assumptions of 9 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.
 
Guidance for 2004
 
Consistent with previous guidance, the company expects 2004 sales of approximately $28 billion.

Cash and Debt Measurements
 
Northrop Grumman's total debt declined to $5.9 billion at December 31, 2003 from $9.6 billion at December 31, 2002, primarily due to the successful execution of the company's plan to reduce debt assumed in the TRW transaction. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased to $116 million from $102 million for the 2002 fourth quarter, in part due to the adoption of SFAS 150, which required $6 million of dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for the quarter to be classified as interest expense. The ratio of net debt to total capital at December 31, 2003, declined to 26 percent from 34 percent at the end of 2002. The company's cash provided by operations for the 2003 fourth quarter totaled $773 million. During 2003, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of approximately $89.50 per share.
