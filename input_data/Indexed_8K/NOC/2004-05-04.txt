Company Confirms Previous 2004 Guidance
 
LOS ANGELES  May 4, 2004  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that first quarter 2004 income from continuing operations rose 31 percent to $228 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, compared with $174 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the same period of 2003. Sales for the first quarter of 2004 increased 21 percent to $7.1 billion from $5.9 billion for the same period of 2003.
 
Total operating margin for the 2004 first quarter was $434 million compared with $328 million in the same period a year ago. The first quarter 2004 total operating margin includes $110 million of unallocated corporate expenses compared with $30 million for the 2003 first quarter. First quarter 2004 unallocated corporate expenses rose $80 million, mainly due to an additional provision for legal and interest costs relating to an Indiana Court of Appeals decision on April 27, 2004, affirming lower court awards against the company and in favor of Allison Gas Turbine. The awards related to cost overruns on a discontinued prototype aircraft from the 1980s. Unallocated corporate expenses for the quarter also included higher mark-to-market stock compensation expenses and environmental remediation accruals.
 
 
 
First quarter 2004 total operating margin includes pension expense determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of $90 million versus pension expense of $140 million in the first quarter of 2003. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) increased total operating margin by $80 million in the first quarter of 2004 and $71 million for the comparable 2003 period.
 
"Overall, first quarter results from our operations were outstanding. Each of our segments generated strong double-digit sales growth and solid increases in profit," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Bookings for the quarter increased 19 percent, and we are on track to achieve our 2004 financial targets."
 
"I'm pleased with this quarter's performance, and looking at the total picture, we are in excellent shape to continue to drive operational and financial performance," Sugar added. "We are living in very challenging times and we believe that our strategy, which is to anticipate the changing nature of 21
st
century warfare and lead the revolutionary advances in technology that are redefining both the battlefield and our security at home, is clearly on target."
 
Net income for the 2004 first quarter was $232 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with $253 million, or $1.34 per diluted share for the same period of 2003. First quarter 2004 income from discontinued operations was $1 million compared with $80 million in the previous year. First quarter 2003 income from discontinued operations included the results of TRW Automotive, which was sold on Feb. 28, 2003.
 
Contract acquisitions were $8.4 billion in the first quarter of 2004 compared with $7.1 billion for the same period of 2003. Total funded backlog was $28.2 billion at March 31, 2004, compared with $26.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2003. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $57.6 billion at March 31, 2004, compared with $58.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2003.
 
Guidance for 2004
 
Consistent with previous guidance, the company expects 2004 sales of approximately $28 billion. Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to range between $5.60 and $5.90, which includes estimated pension expense of approximately $345 million and pension expense recognized under CAS, which is generally recoverable under government contracts, of approximately $320 million. These estimates have been refined to reflect the latest updates for foreign pension plans and plan participant census data. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 is expected to total approximately $1.5 billion.

INTEGRATED SYSTEMS
 
 
Integrated Systems sales for the first quarter of 2004 increased 39 percent over the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to increased F-35, Global Hawk and MP-RTIP sales in the Air Combat Systems business area as well as increased E-2 Advanced Hawkeye sales in the Airborne Early Warning/Electronic Warfare Systems business area.

Debt and Cash Measurements

Interest expense for the first quarter of 2004 declined to $113 million from $144 million for the 2003 first quarter as a result of a reduction in fixed-rate debt acquired with the acquisition of TRW Inc. First quarter 2004 interest expense also includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS 150  , which was adopted on July 1, 2003, and required $6 million of dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for the quarter to be classified as interest expense.
