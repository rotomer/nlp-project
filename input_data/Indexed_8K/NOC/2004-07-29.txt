Second Quarter 2004 Results
 
Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Increase 44 Percent to $0.79
 
Income from Continuing Operations Increases 40 Percent
 
Sales Increase 11 Percent to $7.4 Billion
 
Guidance Raised for 2004 Sales, Earnings per Share and Net Cash Provided by Operations
 
LOS ANGELES  July 29, 2004  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that second quarter 2004 income from continuing operations rose 40 percent to $289 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared with $207 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the same period of 2003. The increase reflects higher sales and operating margin, as well as a lower tax rate than in the second quarter of 2003. Sales for the second quarter of 2004 increased 11 percent to $7.4 billion from $6.6 billion for the same period of 2003.
 
"These results reinforce Northrop Grumman's record of solid sales and earnings growth and demonstrate our ability to consistently deliver strong financial performance," said Ronald D. Sugar, chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Based on the strength of year-to-date results, we now expect 2004 sales to increase to around $29 billion, earnings per share from continuing operations to grow to between $2.90 and $3.00, and net cash provided by operations to be about $1.7 billion."
Operating margin for the 2004 second quarter increased 24 percent to $483 million from $391 million in the same period a year ago. Second quarter 2004 operating margin includes lower pension expense and higher unallocated corporate expenses than in the second quarter of 2003, as well as the effect of a $60 million pre-tax charge for increased projected costs for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program reported in the Electronic Systems segment.
 
Second quarter 2004 pension expense, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, declined to $86 million from $140 million in the second quarter of 2003. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) increased operating margin by $77 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $66 million for the comparable 2003 period.
 
Unallocated corporate expenses were $53 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $22 million in the second quarter of 2003. The $31 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily due to higher mark-to-market stock compensation expense and deferred state income taxes.
 
The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2004 second quarter was 26 percent compared with 31 percent in the 2003 second quarter. During the second quarter of 2004, the company completed studies and recognized additional tax credits of $31 million related to research and development and export sales activities for the years 1997 through 2003.
 
Net income for the 2004 second quarter was $295 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared with $205 million, or $0.54 per diluted share for the same period of 2003.
 
Contract acquisitions were $5.3 billion in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $5.2 billion for the same period of 2003. Total funded backlog was $26.2 billion at June 30, 2004, compared with $26.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2003. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $57.2 billion at June 30, 2004, compared with $58.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2003.
 
2004 Guidance
 
The company expects 2004 sales of approximately $29 billion versus previous guidance of approximately $28 billion. Earnings per share from continuing operations are now expected to range between $2.90 and $3.00 versus previous guidance of between $2.80 and $2.95. Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion in 2004, versus the prior estimate of approximately $1.5 billion.
 
Segment Results
 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
 
 
Electronic Systems second quarter 2004 sales increased 5 percent from the second quarter of 2003 due to revenue increases in Government Systems and Defensive Systems. Sales in Government Systems rose 72 percent, primarily due to higher sales to the U.S. Postal Service. Defensive Systems revenue increased 39 percent reflecting increased sales of infrared countermeasures for military helicopters, LITENING targeting pods, and test equipment. These sales increases were partially offset by lower sales in Aerospace Systems and Space Systems. Second quarter 2004 operating margin declined 7 percent due to a $60 million pre-tax charge for increased projected costs for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development combat avionics program. The principal portion of the charge reflects a higher estimate to complete qualification and production of the "Falcon Edge" electronic warfare suite. The impact of the charge was partially offset by improved performance and contract close-outs for several programs in the Navigation Systems, Defensive Systems, Aerospace Systems, and Government Systems business areas.
 
SHIPS
 
 
Ships 2004 second quarter sales, which include the financial results of the Newport News and Ship Systems sectors, increased 14 percent compared with the 2003 second quarter, driven by higher sales in Surface Combatants, Amphibious & Auxiliary, and Submarines, which were partially offset by a decline in revenue in Aircraft Carriers. Surface Combatants sales rose 38 percent, primarily due to higher DD(X) program revenue. Amphibious & Auxiliary revenue rose 31 percent due to higher revenue in the LPD-17 and LHD-8 programs. Operating margin for the 2004 second quarter increased more than fourfold compared with the 2003 second quarter due to a $68 million pre-tax charge for the commercial Polar Tanker program recorded in the second quarter of 2003.
 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
 
 
Information Technology second quarter 2004 sales increased 9 percent due to higher revenue in Government Information Technology and Enterprise Information Technology. Government Information Technology revenue increased 13 percent, primarily due to new business awards and organic sales growth in existing programs. Enterprise Information Technology increased 12 percent, primarily due to expanded opportunities for product and service sales with civil agencies. Second quarter 2004 operating margin increased 18 percent, as compared with the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to higher revenue in Government Information Technology and Enterprise Information Technology and improved program performance in Commercial Information Technology.
 
MISSION SYSTEMS
 
 
Mission Systems second quarter 2004 sales increased 18 percent, primarily due to revenue increases in Command, Control & Intelligence Systems and Missile Systems. Command, Control & Intelligence Systems revenue increased 26 percent, primarily due to higher revenue for the Tactical Automated Security Systems II program. Missile Systems revenue increased 12 percent, reflecting revenue from the new Kinetic Energy Interceptors program and the XonTech acquisition, as well as increased revenue from existing programs. Second quarter 2004 operating margin rose 10 percent due to higher volume compared with second quarter 2003 results. Operating margin in the 2003 second quarter included the recognition of favorable performance on a restricted program.
 
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS
 
 
Integrated Systems sales for the second quarter of 2004 increased 13 percent over the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to higher sales in Airborne Early Warning/Electronic Warfare Systems and Air Combat Systems. Airborne Early Warning/Electronic Warfare Systems revenue increased 28 percent due to higher volume in the E-2 Advanced Hawkeye and EA-6B programs. Air Combat Systems revenue increased 8 percent due to higher volume in the F-35, Global Hawk, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion programs. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2004 declined 27 percent reflecting the segment's changing business mix, which includes a greater proportion of lower margin development programs, including F-35, Global Hawk, E-2 Advanced Hawkeye, and the E-10A.
 
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
 
 
Space Technology second quarter 2004 sales rose 14 percent over second quarter 2003 results, primarily due to higher sales in Software Defined Radios, Civil Space, and Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance. Software Defined Radios revenue increased 38 percent, primarily due to higher volume in the F-35 and F/A-22 programs. Civil Space revenue increased 28 percent, primarily due to higher volume in the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System and James Webb Space Telescope programs. Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance revenue also rose more than 18 percent. Second quarter 2004 operating margin rose 11 percent as compared with the second quarter 2003, primarily due to higher sales volume.
 
Debt and Cash Measurements
 
Northrop Grumman's total debt was $5.8 billion at June 30, 2004, compared with $5.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2003. Interest expense for the second quarter of 2004 declined to $112 million from $119 million for the 2003 second quarter as a result of a reduction in fixed-rate debt acquired with the acquisition of TRW Inc. Second quarter 2004 interest expense also includes the impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150  , which was adopted on July 1, 2003, and required $6 million of dividends payable on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for the quarter to be classified as interest expense.
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the 2004 second quarter decreased to $610 million versus net cash provided by operating activities of $737 million for the second quarter of 2003. The decrease was primarily due to higher tax payments in the second quarter of 2004 compared with the second quarter of 2003.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the company repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $49.92 per share, after giving effect for the 2-for-1 stock split, in the form of a stock dividend, effective June 21, 2004. Since the Aug. 20, 2003, announcement of a plan to repurchase up to $700 million of Northrop Grumman common stock, the company has repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $47.50.
