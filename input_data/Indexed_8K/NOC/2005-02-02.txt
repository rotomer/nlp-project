2005 Financial Guidance Raised for Sales and Cash from Operations
 
LOS ANGELES  Feb. 2, 2005  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that fourth quarter 2004 income from continuing operations rose 62 percent to $296 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, from $183 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the same period of 2003. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 10 percent to $7.8 billion from $7.1 billion for the same period of 2003. Fourth quarter 2004 and fourth quarter 2003 operating results reflect the reclassification of certain operations from discontinued to continuing operations.
 
"We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Sales and operating margin growth were solid in nearly every business. Our strong cash generation

and double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2004 allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, increase the dividend by 15 percent, and initiate a new $1 billion share repurchase program.
 
"In 2005, we expect to grow sales to between $31 billion and $31.5 billion, increase earnings per share from continuing operations to between $3.45 and $3.60, and generate cash from operations of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. We plan to continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy aimed at maintaining growth and increasing value for our shareholders," Sugar concluded.
 
Operating margin for the 2004 fourth quarter increased 58 percent to $573 million from $362 million for the same period of 2003 due to improved operating segment performance, lower pension expense, and lower unallocated corporate expenses. Fourth quarter 2004 operating margin also includes a $42 million pre-tax charge for increased projected costs for the Wedgetail fixed-price development program in the Electronic Systems segment.
 
Fourth quarter 2004 pension expense, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, declined to $86 million from $145 million for the same period of 2003. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) increased operating margin by $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $64 million for the same period of 2003.
 
Other, net for the 2004 fourth quarter declined to ($25) million from $2 million for the same period of 2003 due to several one-time expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the company recorded a $15 million foreign currency exchange loss on the liquidation of a subsidiary loan and a $13 million expense related to the early retirement of $250 million 9.375 percent debentures due 2024.
 
Unallocated corporate expenses for the 2004 fourth quarter declined to $31 million from $67 million for the same period of 2003. The decrease in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily due to lower estimates of unrecoverable costs, and lower legal and mark-to-market stock compensation expenses.
 
Net income for the 2004 fourth quarter increased 31 percent to $294 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, from $224 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the same period of 2003.
 
Contract acquisitions for the 2004 fourth quarter increased to $11.9 billion from $10.5 billion for the same period of 2003. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $58.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2004 compared with $58.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2003.

Reclassification of Discontinued Operations
 
On Oct. 17, 2002, the company announced its intention to sell the businesses comprising its Component Technologies reporting segment, and these businesses were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of 2002.

During the third quarter of 2004 the company suspended its efforts to sell these remaining businesses, and they were reclassified to continuing operations. The operating results of these businesses are reported under the segment titled "Other."
