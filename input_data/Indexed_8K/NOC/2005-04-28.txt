Northrop Grumman Reports First Quarter 2005 Results
 
Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Increase 69 Percent to $1.08
 
Income from Continuing Operations Increases 72 Percent to $398 Million
 
Sales Increase 4 Percent to $7.5 Billion
 
LOS ANGELES  April 28, 2005  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that first quarter 2005 income from continuing operations rose 72 percent to $398 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, from $232 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Sales for the first quarter of 2005 increased 4 percent to $7.5 billion from $7.2 billion for the same period of 2004. First quarter 2004 sales increased $59 million as a result of the reclassification of certain operations from discontinued to continuing operations.
 
First quarter 2005 income from continuing operations includes a previously announced after-tax gain of $45 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, from the sale of approximately 7.3 million shares of TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (NYSE: TRW) common stock.
 
"Solid sales growth, higher operating profit from all six of our business segments, and lower corporate and interest expense drove this quarter's strong financial performance and demonstrate Northrop Grumman's intense focus on operational and financial execution," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president.
 
"Cash from operations for the quarter was solid and supports our ongoing plan to invest for growth and distribute cash to shareholders," Sugar concluded.
 
Operating margin for the 2005 first quarter increased 36 percent to $595 million from $438 million for the same period of 2004. The increase was driven by lower unallocated expenses and higher operating margin from all six of the company's business segments.
 
 
 
Unallocated expenses declined to $27 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $107 million for the same period of 2004, primarily due to lower legal costs and lower unrecoverable costs.
 
First quarter 2005 pension expense, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, increased to $103 million from $91 million for the same period of 2004. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) increased operating margin by $92 million in the first quarter of 2005 and $80 million for the same period of 2004.
 
Other, net for the 2005 first quarter increased to $82 million from $10 million for the same period of 2004 due to the sale of approximately 7.3 million shares of TRW common stock, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $70 million.
 
Net income for the 2005 first quarter increased to $409 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, from $236 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. First quarter 2005 net income includes an after-tax gain of $11 million resulting from the sale of Teldix GmbH.
 
Contract acquisitions were $7.8 billion in the first quarter of 2005 compared with $8.5 billion for the same period of 2004. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, increased to $60.4 billion at March 31, 2005, from $58.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2004.
 
Cash Measurements and Debt
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the 2005 first quarter was $263 million, unchanged from the first quarter of 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2005 was reduced by a $99 million litigation settlement payment, and first quarter 2004 net cash provided by operating activities included federal and state tax refunds totaling $104 million. Capital spending in the first quarter totaled $197 million.
 
Northrop Grumman's total debt was $5.2 billion at March 31, 2005, unchanged from Dec. 31, 2004. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2005 declined to $95 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $113 million in the first quarter of 2004 primarily due to a reduction in fixed-rate debt.
 
2005 & 2006 Guidance
 
The company continues to expect sales to increase to between $31 and $31.5 billion in 2005. For 2006, the company expects sales to increase to between $32 and $33
 
 
billion versus its previous guidance of approximately $33 billion. The range for 2006 sales guidance reflects the company's present understanding of the U.S. Navy's plans for the DD(X) acquisition strategy.
 
The company now expects 2005 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to increase to between $3.70 and $3.85 versus previous guidance of $3.60 to $3.75. The company has increased 2005 earnings per share guidance primarily to reflect the delay in adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), until Jan. 1, 2006. The company's prior 2005 earnings per share guidance reflected an estimated expense of approximately $40 million associated with adoption of the new standard in the third quarter of 2005.
Share-Based Payment
 
Guidance for 2005 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations also includes estimated pension expense as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of $415 million and CAS pension expense of $375 million.
 
For 2006, the company expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to increase, on a percentage basis, at a solid double-digit rate, excluding the impact of the $45 million, or $0.12 per share, after-tax gain on the TRW common stock sale on 2005 results. The estimated growth in 2006 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations is before adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The company continues to evaluate the impact of the new standard on future compensation plans.
 
The estimated growth in 2006 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations assumes that pension expense as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and CAS pension expense are the same as estimates for 2005. Actual 2006 pension expense is subject to variation and will depend on plan asset returns in 2005 and discount rate and expected rate-of-return assumptions.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 is expected to increase to between $2.2 and $2.5 billion, and net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.
 
Share Repurchase Program
 
On Oct. 26, 2004, the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase $1 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which is expected to be completed over 12 to 18 months, commencing in November 2004. Share repurchases will take place at management's discretion and under pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in privately negotiated transactions.
 
During the first quarter of 2005 the company repurchased 6.4 million common shares at an average price of $52.69 per share. As of March 31, 2005, under the current
 
 
authorization, the company had repurchased 11.9 million common shares at an average price of approximately $54.41 per share. Through the end of the first quarter of 2005, the company has repurchased a total of 26.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $51.30 since August of 2003.
 
Segment Results
 
Effective Jan. 1, 2005, certain business areas within the Electronic Systems, Ships and Space Technology segments were realigned and some business areas have been renamed.

ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
 
 
Electronic Systems first quarter 2005 sales increased slightly from the first quarter of 2004.

The increase in Government Systems includes higher sales of biohazard detection systems. Electronic Systems first quarter 2005 operating margin increased 2 percent from the first quarter of 2004 primarily due to improved performance in Government Systems.
 
On Jan.1, 2005, the manufacturer of complex printed circuit boards and assemblies and the electronic connector manufacturer previously reported under "Other" were realigned to the company's Electronic Systems segment. The impact to prior year results for Electronic Systems is not significant and prior year results have not been reclassified.
 
SHIPS
 
 
Ships first quarter 2005 sales, which include the financial results of the Newport News and Ship Systems sectors, increased 5 percent from the first quarter of 2004, due to higher sales in Expeditionary Warfare, Coast Guard and Coastal Defense, and Submarines. Expeditionary Warfare sales rose 25 percent, due to higher revenue in the
 
 
LPD and LHD programs. Coast Guard and Coastal Defense revenue rose 150 percent due to higher revenue in the Deepwater program, and Submarines sales rose 12 percent due to higher revenue in the Virginia-class program. These sales increases were partially offset by lower revenue in Commercial and Other, and Surface Combatants. Ships first quarter 2005 operating margin increased 21 percent from the first quarter of 2004 due to higher volume and improved performance in Expeditionary Warfare.
 
MISSION SYSTEMS
 
 
Mission Systems first quarter 2005 sales increased 10 percent from the first quarter of 2004 due to revenue increases in Missile Systems and Command, Control & Intelligence Systems, which were partially offset by lower sales in Technical & Management Services.

Command, Control & Intelligence Systems revenue increased 9 percent primarily due to higher revenue from restricted programs. Technical & Management Services revenue declined 11 percent.

Airborne Early Warning & Electronic Warfare Systems revenue increased 33 percent due to higher volume from the E-2 Advanced Hawkeye and EA-18G programs. Air Combat Systems revenue rose 10 percent, primarily due to higher revenue from the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Programs (MP-RTIP) programs. Airborne Ground Surveillance & Battle Management Systems revenue declined 8 percent due to lower revenue in the Joint STARS program. Integrated Systems first quarter 2005 operating margin increased 17 percent from the first quarter of 2004 due to higher sales volume and improved program performance in Airborne Early Warning & Electronic Warfare Systems.
 
 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SPACE TECHNOLOGY
 
 
Space Technology first quarter 2005 sales increased 7 percent from the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to higher sales in Civil Space and Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance, which were partially offset by lower revenue in Satellite Communications.
