Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
 
(i) On May 17, 2005 the shareholders of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the "Registrant") approved an amendment to the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors to increase the number of shares available to a maximum of 175,000 shares. The amended 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
(ii) The Registrant's Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") delegated authority to the Chairman of the Committee to amend certain provisions of the Registrant's Restricted Performance Stock Rights (RPSRs) terms and conditions and the 2002 Annual Incentive Plan upon the request of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Pursuant to this delegation of authority, on May 18, 2005, the Chairman of the Committee approved the following:
 
(a) Section 2.2 of the Terms and Conditions Applicable to Restricted Performance Stock Rights is amended by adding the following paragraph between the second and third paragraphs:
 
"Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this paragraph, for the purpose of computing the time and manner of payment of Grantee's RPSRs, the termination of employment by Grantee on account of Retirement shall be treated as a termination on account of death or Disability, if: (1) contemporaneous with such Retirement the Grantee accepts employment with a not-for-profit entity; federally funded research and development center; local, state or federal government; public or private college or university, or other, similar entity, and (2) the Committee determines in its discretion that such employment may likely give rise to a conflict of interest or appearance thereof."
 
(b) The amendment set forth in subsection (a) above applies to both outstanding and future RPSRs.
 
(c) Section III, Subsection 5 of the Northrop Grumman 2002 Annual Incentive Plan: Incentive Compensation Plan (for Non-Section 162(m) Officers), Performance Achievement Plan, and Incentive Management Achievement Plan is amended by adding the following two sentences to the end thereof:
 
"For the purpose of this section, retirement requires a Participant to be age 55 or older with at least 10 years of service. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, if contemporaneous with the Participant's retirement, (1) the Participant accepts employment with a not-for-profit entity; federally funded research and development center; local, state or federal government; public or private college or university, or other, similar entity, and (2) the Committee determines in its discretion that such employment may likely give rise to a conflict of interest or
 
appearance thereof, then the Committee may determine that a pro-rated Incentive Compensation award shall be paid within 10 business days of retirement. For the purpose of computing the pro-rated award, the Unit Performance Factor (see Section V) shall be the greater of (1) 1.0 or (2) the average of the Unit Performance Factors for the three calendar years completed before retirement (or for two years or one year, if the Participant does not have Unit Performance Factors for three years). For the purpose of computing the prorated award, the Individual Performance Factor (see Section VII) shall be the average of the Individual Performance Factors for the three calendar years completed before retirement (or for two years or one year, if the Participant does not have Individual Performance Factors for three years)."
 
Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
 
 
(i) On May 17, 2005 Registrant's shareholders approved the proposal contained in the definitive Proxy Statement dated April 12, 2005 to amend Registrant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The amendment eliminates the classified board structure and provides for annual election of directors, commencing with directors whose current terms expire in 2006. A copy of Registrant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the form filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on May 17, 2005 is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Report on Form 8-K.

Registrant's Bylaws as amended through May 17, 2005 are attached as Exhibit 99.3 to this Report on Form 8-K.
 
Section 9  Financial Statements and Exhibit
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
The purpose of the Northrop Corporation 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan") is to promote the long-term growth and financial success of Northrop Corporation (the "Company") by attracting and retaining non-employee directors of outstanding ability and assisting the Company in promoting a greater identity of interest between the Company's non-employee directors and its stockholders.
 
 
The Plan shall become effective upon the approval by the stockholders of the Company. The Plan shall operate and shall remain in effect until terminated by action of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board").
 
 
The Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Rule 16b-3(c)(2)(ii) adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and accordingly is intended to be self-governing. To this end the Plan requires no discretionary action by any administrative body with regard to any transaction under the Plan. To the extent, if any, that any questions of interpretation arise, these shall be resolved by this Nominating Committee (or any successor committee) of the Board.
 
 
Only directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company ("Eligible Directors") shall participate in the Plan.
 
 
The maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") that shall be reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be 175,000 shares, subject to adjustment upon changes in the capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 6 of the Plan. The shares of Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Plan may be, at the election of the Company, either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, and no fractional shares shall be issued under the Plan. Shares of Common Stock that are covered (i) pursuant to elections permitted under Section 9 of the Plan or (ii) as reinvested dividends under Section 10 of the Plan shall be applied to reduce the maximum number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance under the Plan.
 
 
The Board, as it deems appropriate to meet the intent of the Plan, may make such adjustments to the number of shares available under the Plan pursuant to Section 5 and to any outstanding Stock Units established under Section 9 of the Plan, provided such adjustments are consistent with the effect on other stockholders arising from any corporate restructuring action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation, spin-off, recapitalization, or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting shares. The Board may also make such similar appropriate adjustment in the calculation of Fair Market Value as it deems necessary to preserve Eligible Directors' rights under the Plan.
 
 
Fair Market Value for all purposes under the Plan shall mean the average (rounded up to the nearest cent) of the closing price on the last day of the month of a share of Common Stock for each of the preceding twelve calendar months, or shorter period as may be applicable, as reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 
The annual cash retainer payable to each Eligible Director for services as a director, excluding any fees payable for meetings of the Board or Board Committees or for extraordinary services, shall be payable partly in shares of Common Stock as provided under the Plan. Accordingly, for Plan purposes only, the amount of the annual retainer payable to each Eligible Director in cash shall be reduced by 30%. As soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days following the end of each calendar year of the Plan, each Eligible Director shall automatically be granted a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to 30% of the Retainer earned for the prior year ("Stock Retainer Portion"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first calendar year of the Plan in which the amount of the annual retainer payable in cash or stock is adjusted, each Eligible Director shall receive an adjusted payment in shares under this Section 8 as is appropriate.
 
 
(a) Commencing on the effective date of the Plan, and each year thereafter, all or part of the Retainer and/or fees payable for meetings of the Board or Board Committees and for extraordinary services may be (i) paid in shares of Common Stock ("Elected Common Stock") or (ii) deferred in share equivalents under Section 9(c), as elected by each Eligible Director. All elections must be made prior to the start of the calendar year for which the Retainer and fees will be paid. Each such election must be irrevocable for the affected calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first calendar year of the Plan, each Eligible Director shall be permitted to elect payment in Common Stock or deferred payment of all or some of the Retainer and/or the fees earned for the period beginning on the first month following the effective date of the Plan and ending on December 31, 1993, providing the Eligible Director has made an irrevocable election to this effect prior to stockholder approval of the Plan.
 
(b) Elected Common Stock payments shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days, following the end of the calendar year for which the election was made. The number of shares of Common Stock payable shall equal the elected cash amount divided by the Fair Market Value.
 
(c) Deferred amounts shall be credited to an account in units which are equivalent in value to shares of Common Stock ("Stock Units"). The number of Stock Units credited to an account shall equal the deferred cash amount divided by the Fair Market Value determined no later than 30 days following the end of the calendar year for which the deferral was elected. The period of deferral may be any period specified by an Eligible Director, provided that the designated payment date must be the first day of a subsequent calendar year and is no earlier than twelve months following the establishment of the affected Stock Unit amount. All Stock Units shall be paid in shares of Common Stock in a single distribution. Stock Units shall be nontransferable and shall not be assignable, alienable, saleable or otherwise transferable by the participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. A participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any distributions under the Plan upon the death of the participant.
 
 
(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days, following the end of each calendar year of the Plan, each Eligible Director shall receive additional shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock issued to such Eligible Director for such prior year under Sections 8 and 9, if applicable, times
 
(ii) the aggregate cash dividends paid by the Company on a share of Common Stock during such prior year, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar months during such year which the Eligible Director served on the Board, and the denominator of which is twelve, (iv) divided by the Fair Market Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first calendar year of the Plan the numerator for this calculation shall be the number of months included in the period beginning with the first month following the effective date of the Plan and ending on December 31, 1993.
 
(b) As soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days, following the end of each calendar year of the Plan, each deferred Stock Unit account shall be credited with additional Stock Units equal to (i) the number of Stock Units credited to such account (including any Stock Units credited for the prior year), (ii) the aggregate cash dividends paid by the Company on a share of Common Stock during such prior year, (iii) divided by the Fair Market Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first calendar year of the Plan, the number of additional Stock Units shall be pro-rated, based on the number of months included in the period (beginning with the first month following the effective date of the Plan and ending on December 31, 1993) as a ratio of twelve.
 
(c) Any portion of a calendar month during which an Eligible Director served on the Board shall be deemed a full month of service.
 
 
An Eligible Director who leaves the Board prior to the end of any calendar year shall not receive any Common Stock payments nor be credited with additional Stock Units representing the Stock Retainer Portion, Elected Common Stock, or elected deferral, as applicable, for such calendar year. In lieu thereof, such Eligible Director or his or her estate shall receive a cash payment equal to what would have been received in shares of Common Stock or Stock Units for the period of the calendar year for which such Eligible Director served as a director of the Company.
 
 
(a) As promptly as practicable following the end of each calendar year, but no later than 30 days subsequent to such date, the Company shall issue stock certificates registered in the name of each Eligible Director receiving a Stock Retainer Portion grant, an elected Common Stock payment, or a deferred stock payment representing the number of shares of Common Stock (i) granted to such Eligible Director, (ii) payable under a Common Stock payment election, or (iii) equivalent to Stock Units which are payable under the applicable deferral election.
 
(b) Whenever under the terms of the Plan a fractional share would be required to be issued, the fractional share shall be rounded up to the next full share.
 
(c) All shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Company may deem advisable or legally necessary under any laws, statutes, rules, regulations and other legal requirements, including those of any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed and any applicable Federal, state or foreign securities law.
 
(d) Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock under the Plan if, in the opinion of legal counsel, the issuance and delivery of such shares would constitute a violation by the Eligible Director or the Company of any applicable law or regulation of any governmental authority, including, without limitation, Federal and state securities laws, or the regulations of any stock exchange on which the Company's securities may then be listed.
 
 
The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan. The Board may also amend the Plan if deemed to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; provided, however, that (a) no
 
such amendment may impair any participant's right regarding any outstanding grants, elections or Stock Units or other right to receive shares or cash payments under the Plan without his or her consent, (b) the Plan may not be amended more than once every six months, unless such amendment is permitted by Rule 16b-3(c)(2)(ii)(B) under the 1934 Act, and (c) no such amendment may cause the Plan not to comply with Rule 16b-3, or any successor rule, under the 1934 Act.
 
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights by virtue of a pending grant or election under the Plan, such rights (unless otherwise determined by the Committee) shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
 
Neither the Plan, nor the granting of Common Stock nor any other action taken pursuant to the Plan, shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Company will retain an Eligible Director for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation. Nothing in this Plan shall in any way limit or affect the right of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to remove any Eligible Director or otherwise terminate his or her service as a director of the Company.
 
 
The Plan and all rights and obligations under the Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California and applicable Federal law.
 
 
The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of a participant, including, without limitation, the estate of such participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the participant's creditor.
 
 
The Eligible Director in whose name the certificates are registered shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares, including the right to vote the Common Stock and receive dividends and other distributions made on the Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan shall be fully paid and non-assessable.

(vii) a proxy or information statement describing the proposed Business Combination and complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules and/or regulations) shall be mailed to stockholders of the Corporation at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of such Business Combination (whether or not such proxy or information statement is required to be mailed pursuant to such Act, rules and/or regulations or such subsequent provisions).
 
3. For the purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the following definitions shall apply:

EXHIBIT 1
 
 
Section 1. The shares of such series shall be designated as the "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 3,500,000.
Designation and Amount.
 
Section 2. The holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of any funds legally available therefor, at the rate per year herein specified, payable quarterly at the rate of one-fourth of such amount on the fifteenth day (or, if such day is not a business day, on the first business day thereafter) of January, April, July and October in each year. The rate of dividends shall initially be $7.00 per year per share. Thereafter, the rate of dividends shall be increased to $9.00 per share per year after the October 2001 dividend payment date if the stockholders of the Corporation shall not have, prior to that time, approved the issuance of all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The rate of dividends shall be decreased to $7.00 per share after the first quarterly dividend payment date after Stockholder Approval is obtained. Cash dividends upon the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall commence to accrue and shall be cumulative from the date of issuance.
Dividends.
 
If the dividend for any dividend period shall not have been paid or set apart in full for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the deficiency shall be fully paid or set apart for payment before (i) any distributions or dividends, other than distributions or dividends paid in stock ranking junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, shall be paid upon or set apart for Common Stock or stock of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and (ii) any Common Stock or shares of Preferred Stock of any class or series ranking junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation shall be redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration other than stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. No distribution or dividend shall be paid upon, or declared and set apart for, any shares of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for any dividend period unless at the same time a like proportionate distribution or dividend for the same or similar dividend period, ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividends fixed therefor, shall be paid upon or declared and set apart for all shares of Preferred Stock of all series so ranking then outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend.
 
Section 3. Except as provided herein or as may otherwise be required by law, the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights as stockholders with respect to such shares.
Voting Rights.
 
(a) So long as any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the aggregate number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, by an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, by merger or consolidation, or in any other manner:
 
(i) authorize any class or series of stock ranking prior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;
(ii) alter or change the preferences, special rights, or powers given to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect such class of stock adversely, but nothing in this clause (ii) shall require such a class vote (x) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock; (y) in connection with the authorization or increase in the total number of authorized shares of any class of stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; or (z) in connection with the fixing of any of the particulars of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that may be fixed by the Board of Directors as provided in Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation; or
 
(iii) directly or indirectly purchase or redeem less than all of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding unless the full dividends to which all shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding shall then be entitled shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart.
 
(b) If and whenever accrued dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for six quarterly dividend periods (whether or not consecutive), then and in such event, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be entitled to elect two directors at any annual meeting of the stockholders or any special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided. Such right of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to elect two directors may be exercised until the dividends in default on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or funds sufficient therefor set aside; and when so paid or provided for, then the right of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to elect such number of directors shall cease, but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any such future default or defaults. At any time after such voting power shall have so vested in the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of the holders of record of ten percent (10%) or more in amount of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding addressed to him at the principal executive office of the Corporation shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for the election of the directors to be elected by them as hereinafter provided, to be held within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request and at the place and upon the notice provided by law and in the bylaws of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of stockholders; provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be required to call such special meeting in the case of any such request received less than ninety (90) days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual meeting of stockholders. If at any such annual or special meeting or any adjournment thereof the holders of at least a majority of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereat shall be present or represented by proxy, then, by vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock present or so represented at such meeting, the then authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for. The directors so elected shall serve until the next annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and shall qualify; provided, however, that whenever the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be divested of voting power as above provided, the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as a class shall forthwith terminate and the number of the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly.
(c) If, during any interval between any special meeting of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for the election of directors to be elected by them as provided in this Section 3 and the next ensuing annual meeting of stockholders, or between annual meetings of stockholders for the election of directors, and while the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect two directors, the number of directors who have been elected by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall, by reason of resignation, death, or removal, be less than the total number of directors subject to election by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, (i) the vacancy or vacancies in the directors elected by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be filled by the remaining director then in office, if any, who was elected by the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, although less than a quorum, and (ii) if not so filled within sixty (60) days after the creation thereof, the Secretary of the Corporation shall call a special meeting of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and such vacancy or vacancies shall be filled at such special meeting. Any director elected to fill any such vacancy by the remaining director then in office may be removed from office by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. A special meeting of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be called by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for the purpose of removing such director. The Secretary of the Corporation shall, in any event, within ten (10) days after delivery to the Corporation at its principal office of a request to such effect signed by the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, call a special meeting for such purpose to be held within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request; provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be required to call such a special meeting in the case of any such request received less than ninety (90) days before the date fixed for the next ensuing annual meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 4.
Redemption.
 
(a) Shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable except as follows:
 
(i) All, but not less than all, of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to (X) if prior to Stockholder Approval, the greater of (a) the Liquidation Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared, and (b) the Current Market Price of the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issued to such holders if all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock on the Redemption Date pursuant to Section 8; and (Y) after Stockholder Approval, the Liquidation Value plus all dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared, accrued and unpaid as of the Redemption Date, as defined below, on the first day after the twentieth anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(ii) All, but not less than all, of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Corporation at any time after the seventh anniversary of the initial issuance of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Any redemption pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be solely for Common Stock of the Corporation and at the Redemption Date each holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in exchange and upon surrender of the certificate therefor, that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing (X) if prior to Stockholder Approval, the greater of (a) the Liquidation Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared, and (b) the Current Market Price of the
number of shares of Common Stock which would be issued if all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 8 on the Redemption Date; or (Y) if after Stockholder Approval, the Liquidation Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared thereon to the Redemption Date, by (Z) the Current Market Price of the Common Stock as of the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if prior to the Redemption Date there shall have occurred a Transaction, as defined in Section 8(b)(iii), the consideration deliverable in any such exchange shall be the Alternate Consideration as provided in Section 12.
 
(b) Notice of every mandatory or optional redemption shall be mailed at least thirty (30) days but not more than fifty (50) days prior to the Redemption Date to the holders of record of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear upon the books of the Corporation. Each such notice shall specify the date on which such redemption shall be effective (the "Redemption Date"), the redemption price or manner of calculating the redemption price and the place where certificates for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for cancellation.
 
(c) On the date that redemption is being made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 4, the Corporation shall deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock the funds, or stock certificates for Common Stock, necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, having a capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Dividends paid on Common Stock held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder shall be held for the benefit of such holders and paid over, without interest, on surrender of certificates for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Any monies or stock certificates so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of one year from the Redemption Date shall revert to the Corporation. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amounts or deliver such stock certificates and thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall look only to the Corporation for the payment of the redemption price. Any interest accrued on funds deposited pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.
 
(d) Upon the deposit of funds or certificates for Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (c) in respect of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock being redeemed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 4, notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented thereby shall on and after the Redemption Date no longer be deemed outstanding, and all rights of the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the redemption price therefor. Nothing in this Section 4 shall limit the right of a holder to convert shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 8 at any time prior to the Redemption Date, even if such shares have been called for redemption pursuant to Section 4(a).
 
(e) In connection with any redemption pursuant to clause (ii) of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, no fraction of a share of common stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Redemption Date.
Section 5.
Fundamental Change in Control.
 
(a) Not later than 10 business days following a Fundamental Change in Control, as defined below, the Corporation shall mail notice to the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock stating that a Fundamental Change in Control has occurred and advising such holders of their right to exchange (the "Exchange Right") any and all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for shares of Common Stock as provided herein; provided, however, that if prior to the Exchange Date (as defined below) there shall have occurred a Transaction, as defined in Section 8(b)(iii), the consideration deliverable in any such exchange shall be the Alternate Consideration as provided in Section 12. Such notice shall state: (i) the date on which such exchanges shall be effective (the "Exchange Date"), which shall be the 21st business day from the date of giving such notice; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Alternate Consideration) for which each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be exchanged; and (iii) the method by which each holder may give notice of its exercise of the Exchange Right; and (iv) the method and place for delivery of certificates for Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in connection with exchanges pursuant hereto. For a period of twenty (20) business days following the notice provided herein, each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may exercise the Exchange Right as provided herein.
 
(b) Pursuant to the Exchange Right, each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for that number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing an amount equal to (X) if prior to Stockholder Approval, the greater of (a) the Liquidation Value plus all dividends accrued and unpaid with respect to such share as of the Exchange Date, whether or not declared, and (b) the Current Market Price of the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issued if such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 8 on the Exchange Date; or (Y) if after Stockholder Approval, the Liquidation Value plus all dividends accrued and unpaid with respect to such share as of the Exchange Date, whether or not declared, in each case by the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the Exchange Date.
 
(c) The holder of any share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may exercise the Exchange Right by surrendering for such purpose to the Corporation, at its principal office or at such other office or agency maintained by the Corporation for that purpose, a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be exchanged accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to exercise the Exchange Right as to all or a specified number of such shares in accordance with this Section 5 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled to be issued and such other customary documents as are necessary to effect the exchange. In case such notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance in such name or names of shares of Common Stock to which such holder has become entitled. Other than such taxes, the Corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock to which such holder has become entitled on exchange of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days after the surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid), the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock to which the holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so exchanged shall be entitled.
 
(d) From and after the Exchange Date, a holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock who has elected to exchange such shares for Common Stock as herein provided shall have no
voting or other rights with respect to the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock subject thereto, other than the right to receive the Common Stock provided herein upon delivery of the certificate or certificates evidencing shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(e) In connection with the exchange of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, no fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the Exchange Date.
 
(f) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of the Exchange Rights provided herein, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the exchange provided herein. The Corporation shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of Delaware, increase the authorized amount of Common Stock if at any time the number of authorized shares of Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the exchange of all then outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(g) As used herein, the term "Fundamental Change in Control" shall mean any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets, liquidation or recapitalization (other than solely a change in the par value of equity securities) of the Common Stock in which more than one-third of the previously outstanding Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for cash, property or securities other than capital stock of the Corporation or another corporation ("Non Stock Consideration"). For purposes of the preceding sentence, any transaction in which shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for a combination of Non Stock Consideration and capital stock of the Corporation or another corporation shall be deemed to have involved the exchange of a number of shares of Common Stock for Non Stock Consideration equal to the total number of shares exchanged multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is the Fair Market Value of the Non Stock Consideration and the denominator is the Fair Market Value of the total consideration in such exchange, each as determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
 
Section 6. Any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock converted, redeemed, exchanged, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation, and upon the filing of an appropriate certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation and may be reissued as part of another series of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares.
 
Section 7.

The Liquidation Value shall be $100.00 per share.
 
(b) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or if a decree or order for relief in respect of the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on account of any such event the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall have received (X) if prior to Stockholder Approval, the greater of (a) the Liquidation Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared, and (b) the amount which would be distributed to such holders if all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 8; and (Y) after Stockholder Approval, the Liquidation Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not declared, or (ii) to the holders of shares of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends, redemption payments and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, except distributions made ratably on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

Section 8. Subject to the condition that the Stockholder Approval shall first have been obtained, each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time, at the option of the holder thereof into the right to receive shares of Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8.
Conversion.
 
(a) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted into the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, which shall be equal to the Liquidation Value divided by the Conversion Price, as herein defined. Initially the Conversion Price shall be 127% of $86.42. The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 8.
(b) The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
 
(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time declare a dividend, or make a distribution, on the outstanding shares of Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares or combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or shall declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution on any other class or series of capital stock, which dividend or distribution includes Common Stock then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted to equal the number determined by multiplying (A) the Conversion Price immediately prior to such adjustment by (B) a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend, distribution, subdivision or reclassification, and the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such dividend, distribution, subdivision or reclassification. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective (A) in the case of any such dividend or distribution, immediately after the close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, or (B) in the case of any such subdivision, reclassification or combination, at the close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.
 
(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time declare, order, pay or make a dividend or other distribution (including, without limitation, any distribution of stock, evidences of indebtedness or other securities, cash or other property or rights or warrants to subscribe for securities of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by way of distribution, dividend or spinoff, but excluding regular ordinary cash dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Corporation) on its Common Stock, other than a distribution or dividend of shares of Common Stock that is referred to in clause (i) of this paragraph (b), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted to equal the number determined by multiplying (A) the Conversion Price immediately prior to the record date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution by (B) a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the last Trading Day on which purchasers of Common Stock in regular way trading would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the first Trading Day on which purchasers of Common Stock in regular way trading would not be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution (the "Ex-dividend Date"); provided that the fraction determined by the foregoing clause (B) shall not be greater than 1. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be effective at the close of business on the Ex-dividend Date. If the Corporation completes a tender offer or otherwise repurchases shares of Common Stock in a single transaction or a related series of transactions, provided such tender offer or offer to repurchase is open to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (not including open market or other selective repurchase programs), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as though (A) the Corporation had effected a reverse split of the Common Stock to reduce the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding from (x) the number outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the tender offer or the first repurchase for which the adjustment is being made to (y) the number outstanding immediately after the completion of the tender offer or the last repurchase for which the adjustment is being made and (B) the Corporation had paid a dividend on the Common Stock outstanding immediately after completion of the tender offer or the last repurchase for which the adjustment is being made in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate consideration paid by the Corporation pursuant to the tender offer or the repurchases for which the adjustment is being made (the "Aggregate Consideration"); provided that in no event shall the Conversion Price be increased as a result of the foregoing
adjustment. In applying the first two sentences of this Section 8(b)(ii) to the event described in clause (B) of the preceding sentence, the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the date immediately following the closing of any such tender offer or on the date of the last repurchase shall be taken as the value of the Common Stock on the Ex-dividend Date, and the value of the Common Stock on the day preceding the Ex-dividend Date shall be assumed to be equal to the sum of (x) the value on the Ex-dividend Date and (y) the per share amount of the dividend described in such clause (B) computed by dividing the Aggregate Consideration by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after the completion of such tender offer or repurchase. In the event that any of the consideration paid by the Corporation in any tender offer or repurchase to which this Section 8(b)(ii) applies is in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined by an independent investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing to be selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
 
(iii) In case at any time the Corporation shall be a party to any transaction (including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets, liquidation or recapitalization (other than solely a change in the par value of equity securities) of the Common Stock and excluding any transaction to which clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b) applies) in which the previously outstanding Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for different securities of the Corporation or common stock or other securities of another corporation or interests in a noncorporate entity or other property (including cash) or any combination of any of the foregoing (each such transaction being herein called the "Transaction"), then each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding shall thereafter be convertible into, in lieu of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion prior to consummation of such Transaction, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash) upon the consummation of such Transaction by a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock into which one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock would have been convertible (without giving effect to any restriction on convertibility) immediately prior to such Transaction including, on a pro rata basis, the cash, securities or property received by holders of Common Stock in any such transaction. The Corporation shall not be a party to a Transaction that does not expressly contemplate and provide for the foregoing.
 
(iv) If any event occurs as to which the foregoing provisions of this Section 8(b) are not strictly applicable but the failure to make any adjustment to the Conversion Price or other conversion mechanics would not fully and equitably protect the conversion rights of the Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then in each such case the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall make such appropriate adjustments to the Conversion Price or other conversion mechanics (on a basis consistent with the essential intent and principles established in this Section 8) as may be necessary to fully and equitably preserve, without dilution or diminution, the conversion rights of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(c) If any adjustment required pursuant to this Section 8 would result in an increase or decrease of less than 1% in the Conversion Price, the amount of any such adjustment shall be carried forward and adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent adjustment, which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate at least 1% of the Conversion Price.
 
(d) The Board of Directors may at its option increase the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted, in addition to the adjustments required by this Section 8, as shall be determined by it (as evidenced by a resolution of
the Board of Directors) to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income deemed to be received by any holder for federal income tax purposes of shares of Common Stock or Series B Convertible Preferred Stock resulting from any events or occurrences giving rise to adjustments pursuant to this Section 8 or from any other similar event.
 
(e) The holder of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may exercise his right to receive in respect of such shares the shares of Common Stock or other property or securities, as the case may be, to which such holder is entitled by surrendering for such purpose to the Corporation, at its principal office or at such other office or agency maintained by the Corporation for that purpose, a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted, accompanied by a written notice stating that such holder elects to convert all or a specified number of such shares in accordance with this Section 8 and specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock or other property or securities, as the case may be, to which such holder is entitled to be issued and such other customary documents as are necessary to effect the conversion. In case such notice shall specify a name or names other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance in such name or names of shares of Common Stock or other property or securities, as the case may be, to which such holder has become entitled. Other than such taxes, the Corporation will pay any and all issue and other taxes (other than taxes based on income) that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or such other property or securities, as the case may be, to which such holder has become entitled on conversion of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) business days after the surrender of such certificate or certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid), the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates representing the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so converted shall be entitled or such other property or assets, as the case may be, to which such holder has become entitled. The date upon which a holder delivers to the Corporation a notice of conversion and the accompanying documents referred to above is referred to herein as the "Conversion Date."
 
(f) From and after the Conversion Date, a holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall have no voting or other rights with respect to the shares of Series B Convertible Stock subject thereto, other than the right to receive upon delivery of the certificate or certificates evidencing shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as provided by paragraph 8(e), the securities or property described in this Section 8.
 
(g) In connection with the conversion of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, no fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the day on which such shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are deemed to have been converted.
 
(h) Upon conversion of any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, if there are any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, the Corporation shall, at its option, either pay the same in cash or deliver to the holder an additional number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the amount of such accrued and unpaid dividends by the Conversion Price.
(i) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Corporation shall from time to time, in accordance with the laws of Delaware, increase the authorized amount of Common Stock if at any time the number of authorized shares of Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion at such time of all then outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
Section 9. Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as provided in Section 8 hereof, the Corporation shall (i) promptly place on file at its principal office and at the office of each transfer agent for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, a statement, signed by an officer of the Corporation, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the new Conversion Price, and (ii) promptly mail to the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear in the Corporation's stock records a notice stating that the number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible has been adjusted and setting forth the new Conversion Price (or describing the new stock, securities, cash or other property) as a result of such adjustment, a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and the computation thereof, and when such adjustment became effective.

Section 12. For purposes of determining the consideration payable upon exercise of the optional redemption provided in Section 4(a)(ii) and upon the exercise of the Exchange Right provided in Section 5, if there shall have occurred a Transaction, as defined in Section 8(b)(iii), the Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued to a holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) or Section 5, as applicable, shall be deemed to instead be the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable (including cash) upon consummation of such Transaction (the "Alternate Consideration") in respect of the Common Stock that would result in the Fair Market Value of such Alternate Consideration, measured as of the Redemption Date or Exchange Date, as applicable, being equal to (X) if prior to Stockholder Approval, the greater of (a) the Liquidation Value plus all dividends accrued and unpaid with respect to such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, whether or not declared, measured as of the Redemption Date or the Exchange Date, as applicable, and (b) the Fair Market Value of the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash) pursuant to Section 8(b)(iii) which would have been issued if such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted pursuant to Section 8 immediately prior to the consummation of the Transaction; or (Y) if after Stockholder Approval, the Liquidation Value plus all dividends accrued and unpaid with respect to such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, whether or not declared, measured as of the Redemption Date or Exchange Date, as applicable. In the event the subject Transaction provides for an election of the consideration to be received in respect of the Common Stock, then each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to make a similar election with respect to the Alternate Consideration to be received by it under Section 4(a)(ii) or Section 5, as applicable. Any determination of the Fair Market Value of any Alternate Consideration (other than cash) shall be determined by an independent investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The Fair Market Value of any Alternate Consideration that is listed on any national securities exchange or traded on the NASDAQ National Market shall be deemed to be the Current Market Price of such Alternate Consideration.

Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations
 
For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, (2) such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, (3) if the stockholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, has provided the Corporation with a Solicitation Notice, as that term is defined in subclause (c )(iii) of this paragraph, such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the case of a proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of a percentage of the Corporation's voting shares reasonably believed by such stockholder or beneficial holder to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either case, have included in such materials the Solicitation Notice and (4) if no Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this section, the stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this section. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be more timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the filing of a stockholder's notice as described herein. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the Corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice").
 
Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of the second paragraph of this Section 2.06 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the Corporation at least 55 days prior to the Anniversary, a stockholder's notice required by this Bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
 
Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.06 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chair of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defective proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
 
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board or (b) by any stockholder of record of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.06.

For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.06, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.06. Nothing in this Section 2.06 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
. . At any meeting of stockholders, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of shares then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; provided, however, that this Section 2.07 shall not affect any different requirement which may exist under statute, pursuant to the rights of any authorized class or series of stock, or under the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Certificate") for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure governed thereby. In the absence of a quorum, the stockholders present in person or by proxy, by majority vote and without further notice, may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is attained. At any reconvened meeting following such an adjournment at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Section 2.07
Quorum
 
. . A majority of the votes cast at a duly called meeting of stockholders, at which a quorum is present, shall be sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless the vote of a greater or different number thereof is required by statute, by the rights of any authorized class of stock or by the Certificate. Unless the Certificate or a resolution of the Board of Directors adopted in connection with the issuance of shares of any class or series of stock provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share, or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.08
Votes Required
 
. . A stockholder may vote the shares owned of record by him either in person or by proxy executed in writing (which shall include writings sent by telex, telegraph, cable or facsimile transmission) by the stockholder himself or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be in writing, subscribed by the stockholder or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, and dated, but it need not be sealed, witnessed or acknowledged.
Section 2.09

The Corporation shall not be obligated to advance fees and expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent in connection with a proceeding instituted by the Corporation against such person. (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.02(a) to the contrary, the right of employees or agents to advancement of expenses shall be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and on such terms and conditions, including the requirement of security, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

The Corporation may enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.
