Income from Continuing Operations Increases 23 Percent to $366 Million
 
Sales Increase 7 Percent to $8 Billion

LOS ANGELES  July 28, 2005  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations rose 23 percent to $366 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, from $298 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Sales for the second quarter of 2005 increased 7 percent to $8.0 billion from $7.4 billion for the same period of 2004. Previously reported second quarter 2004 sales increased $61 million as a result of the reclassification of certain operations from discontinued to continuing operations.
 
"We executed across the board this quarter with higher sales from every segment and double-digit increases in operating margin from five of the six businesses," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Cash from operations showed a healthy increase, reflecting the quality of our earnings growth."
 
"Based on year to date results, we expect earnings per share growth of approximately 30 percent in 2005, reflecting our continuing focus on improving the performance of our businesses," Sugar continued.
 
Operating margin for the 2005 second quarter increased $123 million, or 25 percent, to $616 million from $493 million for the same period of 2004, and included a $107 million, or 19 percent, increase in segment operating margin. Higher operating margin from the company's six business segments and lower net pension and unallocated expense contributed to the increase in operating margin.
 
Second quarter 2005 pension expense, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, increased to $103 million from $86 million for the same period of 2004. Pension expense allocated to contracts pursuant to government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS)
 
 
Northrop Grumman Reports Second Quarter 2005 Results
 
increased operating margin by $105 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $77 million for the same period of 2004.
 
Net interest expense for the 2005 second quarter declined to $69 million from $96 million for the same period of 2004. The $27 million decrease reflects lower debt than in the prior year period, as well as interest income recognized for a state tax refund related to research and development tax credits.
 
The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2005 second quarter was 33.9 percent compared with 25.5 percent in the 2004 second quarter. In the 2004 second quarter the company recognized tax credits of $31 million related to research and development and export sales activities in prior years.
 
Net income for the 2005 second quarter increased to $367 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, from $298 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004.
 
Contract acquisitions were $5.6 billion in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $5.4 billion for the same period of 2004. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $57.1 billion at June 30, 2005, compared with $58.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2004.
 
Cash Measurements and Debt
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the 2005 second quarter was $813 million, compared with $610 million for the second quarter of 2004. Capital spending in the second quarter totaled $149 million.
 
Northrop Grumman's total debt was $5.2 billion at June 30, 2005, unchanged from Dec. 31, 2004.
 
2005 & 2006 Guidance
 
The company continues to expect sales to increase to between $31 and $31.5 billion in 2005. For 2006, the company now expects sales to increase to approximately $32 billion.
 
The company now expects 2005 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to increase to $3.90 to $4.00 versus its prior guidance of $3.70 to $3.85. Guidance for 2005 includes a pre-tax gain of $59 million, or $0.11 per diluted share after-tax, from the July 2005 sale of 1.4 million shares of Endwave common stock. The gain will be included in 2005 third quarter results. The 2005 guidance also includes estimated pension expense as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of $415 million, and CAS pension expense of $395 million. The company's prior estimate of CAS pension expense was $375 million.
 
For 2006, the company expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to increase to between $4.10 and $4.30, which includes an estimated pre-tax expense of $12 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, on January 1, 2006.
Share-Based Payment
 
On May 16, 2005, the company's board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of all outstanding unvested employee stock options (excluding elected officers), effective Sept. 30, 2005, as part of an ongoing evaluation of the company's overall incentive compensation strategy. The amount

associated with the decision to accelerate vesting is being charged over the new vesting period and is not significant.
 
The estimated range for 2006 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations assumes that pension expense as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and CAS pension expense are the same as estimates for 2005. Actual 2006 pension expense is subject to variation and will depend on plan asset returns in 2005 and discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 is expected to range between $2.2 and $2.5 billion, and net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.
 
Share Repurchase Program
 
On Oct. 26, 2004, the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase $1 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. Share repurchases will take place at management's discretion and under pre-established non-discretionary programs from time to time, depending on market conditions, in the open market, and in privately negotiated transactions.
 
During the second quarter of 2005 the company repurchased 2.8 million common shares at an average price of $55.22 per share. As of June 30, 2005, under the current authorization, the company repurchased 14.6 million common shares at an average price of $54.56 per share. Through the end of the 2005 second quarter and since the inception of its share repurchases in August of 2003, the company has repurchased 29 million shares at an average price of $51.68.
