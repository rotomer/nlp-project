2006 Financial Guidance Updated
 
LOS ANGELES  Jan. 24, 2006  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24 percent to $0.92 per diluted share and 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27 percent to $3.81 per diluted share. Sales for the 2005 fourth quarter were $7.9 billion and a record $30.7 billion for 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities for the 2005 fourth quarter more than doubled to $678 million and cash from operations for the year rose 37 percent to $2.6 billion.
 
"Our continued focus on performance drove higher sales, earnings and cash," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman, chief executive officer and president. "Solid overall operating performance, monetization of non-core assets, and our action to reduce share count contributed to this year's excellent results.
 
 
 
"Our outstanding cash generation supported the repurchase of $1.2 billion of our stock, a 13 percent increase in our dividend, and the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. This year's strong financial results were achieved despite the charges associated with Hurricane Katrina and the F-16 Block 60 program.
 
"For 2006, we are raising our guidance for earnings per share and cash from operations. We expect double-digit growth in earnings per share to between $4.25 and $4.40 based on a sales base of approximately $31 billion, and we expect cash from operations to range between $2.3 and $2.6 billion. Based on the strength of this year and our outlook for 2006, we plan to continue executing our balanced cash deployment strategy aimed at increasing value for our shareholders and investing for the future," Sugar concluded.
 
Fourth Quarter 2005 Results
 
Fourth quarter 2005 income from continuing operations rose 21 percent to $331 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, from $273 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004.
 
Fourth quarter 2005 income from continuing operations includes higher total segment operating margin, a lower effective tax rate, and a $14 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 1.3 million shares of Endwave common stock, partially offset by a $65 million pre-tax charge for the company's F-16 Block 60 program. Fourth quarter 2004 income from continuing operations included a $42 million pre-tax charge for the Wedgetail program and a $35 million charge for a legal settlement. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2005 were essentially unchanged at $7.9 billion compared with the same period of 2004.
 
Operating margin for the 2005 fourth quarter was essentially unchanged at $534 million compared with $538 million for the same period of 2004.
 
Other income/expense for the 2005 fourth quarter increased to income of $16 million from an expense of $25 million for the same period of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the company sold 1.3 million shares of Endwave common stock, which generated a $14 million pre-tax gain. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company recorded a $15 million foreign currency exchange loss on the liquidation of a subsidiary loan and a $13 million expense related to the early retirement of debt.
 
Federal and foreign income taxes for the 2005 fourth quarter declined to $128 million from $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The fourth quarter of 2005 includes a $20 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of prior years IRS appeals cases. The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2005 fourth quarter was 27.9 percent compared with 35.5 percent in the 2004 fourth quarter.
 
Net income for the 2005 fourth quarter increased 22 percent to $331 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, from $272 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the same period of 2004. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of
 
 
 
358.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 367.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Contract acquisitions for the 2005 fourth quarter declined to $6.6 billion from $11.9 billion for the same period of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 contract acquisitions were impacted by the delay in the passage of the 2006 defense budget, which resulted in delayed contract awards. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $56.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2005 compared with $58.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2004.
 
2005 Results
 
Income from continuing operations for 2005 rose 27 percent to $1.4 billion, or $3.81 per share, from $1.1 billion, or $2.99 per share, for 2004.
 
Sales for 2005 increased 3 percent to $30.7 billion from $29.9 billion in 2004 reflecting higher sales in every business but Ships. Operating margin for 2005 increased 9 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.0 billion for 2004, reflecting double-digit increases in operating margin in Integrated Systems, Mission Systems, Information Technology, and Space Technology, and a $92 million decline in unallocated expenses principally due to lower legal expenses.
 
Net interest expense for 2005 declined to $334 million from $373 million in 2004. The $39 million decrease reflects lower average debt in 2005.
 
During 2005, the company sold 7.25 million TRW Automotive shares and approximately 3.5 million Endwave shares, which generated pre-tax gains of $70 million and $95 million, respectively. These sales contributed to the increase in other income/expense for 2005 to income of $200 million from an expense of $18 million for 2004.
 
The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for 2005 was 32.3 percent, unchanged from the previous year.

Capital spending totaled $305 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and $824 million for 2005.
 
2006 Guidance
 
The company now expects 2006 sales of approximately $31 billion versus its prior guidance of approximately $32 billion, which reflects the impact of the company's strategic decision in 2006 to exit the value-added reseller business (reported under Information Technology as the Enterprise Information Technology business area). The update to 2006 sales guidance also contemplates the completion of the sales of other small businesses.
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to range between $4.25 and $4.40, and include estimated pension expense as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of $450 million and CAS pension expense of $425 million. The company's estimated pension expense for 2006 is based on a composite discount rate of 5.75 percent and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion in 2006.
 
Share Repurchase Program
 
On Oct. 25, 2005, the company announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be completed over 12 to 18 months. On Nov. 4, 2005, as part of the new program, the company executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that reduced its shares outstanding by approximately 9 million. During 2005, the company repurchased approximately 22 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion.

The company had shares outstanding of 347.4 million as of Dec. 31, 2005.
 
 
 
Segment Results
 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
 
 
Electronic Systems fourth quarter 2005 sales were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily due to increases in Defensive & Navigation Systems, Naval & Marine Systems, and Defense Other, which were partially offset by lower sales in Aerospace Systems. Defensive & Navigation Systems sales increased 13 percent; Naval & Marine and Defense Other sales each increased 8 percent.
 
Electronic Systems fourth quarter 2005 operating margin declined 14 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004 due to a $65 million pre-tax charge for the F-16 Block 60 fixed-price development program, which was partially offset by improved performance in Defensive & Navigation Systems. The charge reflects a higher estimate to complete the Falcon Edge electronic warfare suite. Fourth quarter 2004 operating margin included the impact of improved performance and contract close-outs for several programs, which was partially offset by a $42 million pre-tax charge for the Wedgetail fixed-price development program.
 
Electronic Systems 2005 sales increased 4 percent from 2004 due to higher sales in Defensive & Navigation Systems and Government Systems, partially offset by lower sales in Defense Other and Aerospace Systems. Defensive & Navigation Systems sales increased 12 percent due to higher sales for the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) and EA-18 programs. Government Systems sales increased 19 percent due to higher sales of bio-detection and communication systems. The decrease in Defense Other reflects the transfer of an airborne surveillance program to Aerospace Systems and lower international sales. The decrease in Aerospace Systems is primarily due to lower volume on the Longbow Missile and Fire Control Radar programs and to lower volume and a sales adjustment on the F-16 Block 60 program, which was partially offset by the airborne surveillance program transfer.
 
Electronic Systems 2005 operating margin increased 6 percent from 2004 primarily due to higher sales volume in Defensive & Navigation Systems and improved performance in Government Systems.
 
 
 
SHIPS
 
 
Ships fourth quarter 2005 sales, which include the financial results of the Newport News and Ship Systems sectors, declined 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004 and reflect lower sales at Ship Systems due to hurricane impacts and lower DD(X) sales. Surface Combatants sales declined 56 percent due to lower DD(X) sales and hurricane-related work delays. Expeditionary Warfare sales declined 14 percent due to hurricane-related work delays. Aircraft Carriers revenue increased 8 percent due to higher revenue from the USS and USS programs. Ships fourth quarter 2005 operating margin declined 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004 reflecting lower volume on the DD(X) program, partially offset by higher operating margin in Aircraft Carriers and Submarines.
