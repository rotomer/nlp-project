LOS ANGELES  July 27, 2006  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported second quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $442 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared with $369 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Second quarter 2006 sales were $7.6 billion compared with $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Second quarter 2006 and second quarter 2005 operating results reflect the reclassification of certain operations from continuing to discontinued operations.
 
"With this quarter's solid results, including contract acquisition growth of more than 50 percent, we continue to expect double-digit growth in 2006 earnings per share driven by expanding operating margin and a lower share count," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman and chief executive officer. "We are raising our 2006 earnings per share estimate to a range of $4.35 to $4.45, and we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.3 to $2.6 billion. Electronics maintained their strong operating margin rate, and Information & Services, Aerospace and Ships all posted double-digit growth in operating margins and substantially higher margin rates, reflecting our continued focus on operating performance."
 
 
 
 
The company's second quarter 2006 segment operating margin increased 12 percent to $742 million from $664 million in the second quarter of 2005. Operating margin increased 10 percent to $682 million from $621 million in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Net interest expense for the 2006 second quarter was $84 million compared with $69 million in the prior year period. Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2005 included interest income recognized for a state tax refund related to research and development tax credits.
 
Other income/expense for the 2006 second quarter was an expense of $9 million compared with income of $7 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to a $13 million write-down of marketable securities in the 2006 second quarter.
 
The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2006 second quarter was 25 percent compared with 34 percent in the 2005 second quarter. During the 2006 second quarter, the company received final approval for the agreement previously reached with the Internal Revenue Service regarding audits of the company's B-2 program in years 1997 through 2000. As a result, the company recognized tax benefits of $48 million in the 2006 second quarter due to the reversal of previously established expense provisions. The company now expects its 2006 tax rate to range between 31 and 32 percent, compared with its prior guidance of approximately 33 percent.
 
Net income for the 2006 second quarter increased 17 percent to $430 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, from $367 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 350.1 million for the second quarter of 2006 and 365.2 million for the second quarter of 2005.
 
Contract acquisitions increased 52 percent to $8.1 billion in the second quarter of 2006 from $5.4 billion for the same period of 2005. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $58.1 billion at June 30, 2006 compared with $56.9 billion at June 30, 2005.
 
Cash Measurements, Debt and Share Repurchases
 
Cash provided by continuing operations in the second quarter of 2006 totaled $657 million compared with cash provided by continuing operations of $823 million in the second quarter of 2005. Capital spending totaled $151 million in the 2006 second quarter, including $42 million for Hurricane Katrina capital expenditures at Ships, compared with total capital spending of $149 million in the 2005 second quarter. Since Aug. 29, 2005, hurricane-related insurance recoveries for damage, repair and restoration have totaled $233 million compared with total hurricane-related expenditures of $311 million.
 
 
 
 
Cash and cash equivalents were $751 million at June 30, 2006 compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2005. During the first six months of the year the company reduced total debt by approximately $510 million and repurchased $825 million of its common stock (including approximately 11.6 million shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement).
 
Under the most recent $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization announced in October 2005, $176 million remains. The company expects to complete the repurchase of shares under the current authorization by the end of 2006. Common shares outstanding totaled 344.4 million at June 30, 2006.
 
Reclassification of Reseller Business to Discontinued Operations
 
In January 2006, the company announced its decision to exit the reseller business (previously reported under Information Technology as the Enterprise Information Technology business area). The shutdown of this business was completed in the 2006 second quarter, and the results of this business have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
 
Schedule 4 of this earnings release provides previously reported quarterly financial results and restated results reflecting the reclassification of the reseller business from continuing to discontinued operations.
 
2006 Guidance
 
For 2006, the company expects sales of approximately $30.5 billion, compared with prior guidance of approximately $31 billion. The company expects earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.35 to $4.45, versus prior guidance of $4.25 to $4.40 per share. The company continues to expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion.
 
Business Results
 
As was previously announced, beginning with the first quarter of 2006 the company has implemented enhancements in the reporting of its financial results. The company categorizes its seven reporting segments into four businesses. The results of the Mission Systems, Information Technology and Technical Services segments are aggregated as Information & Services. The results of the Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments are aggregated as Aerospace and the Electronic Systems segment is reported as Electronics. The Newport News and Ship Systems sectors are reported as Ships.
 
The company also revised its reporting of intercompany margin recognition and elimination for the company's operating segments. The operating information shown below includes intersegment sales and operating margin that eliminate in consolidation, as shown in Schedule 2.
 
 
 
 
Information & Services
 
 
Information & Services sales increased $106 million, or 4 percent, during the second quarter of 2006 due to higher sales in all three of its operating segments. The sales increase at Mission Systems includes higher volume in Command, Control & Intelligence Systems, Technical & Management Services, and Missile Systems programs. Higher sales in Information Technology were due to increased activity on Defense and Intelligence programs, which were partially offset by lower sales in Civilian Agencies programs.
 
The 20 percent year-over-year increase in Information & Services operating margin includes higher operating margin from all three segments, but was primarily driven by a 33 percent increase in Mission Systems second quarter operating margin. The increase at Mission Systems reflects improved program performance and lower amortization expense for purchased intangibles than in the prior year period.
 
Aerospace
 
 
Second quarter 2006 Aerospace sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2005. Sales at Integrated Systems increased $6 million due to higher volume on the F/A-18 and F-35 programs, substantially offset by lower volume on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, E-2C Multi-year and Joint STARS programs. Space Technology sales decreased 1 percent due to lower volume for restricted programs, which was partially offset by higher sales in Satellite Communications programs.
 
Aerospace second quarter 2006 operating margin increased 17 percent from the second quarter of 2005 and includes higher operating margin at both Integrated Systems and Space Technology. Integrated Systems operating margin increased 21 percent over the prior year period due to improved program performance. Space Technology operating margin increased 9 percent primarily due to performance improvements in Software Defined Radios.
 
 
 
 
Electronics
 
 
Electronics second quarter 2006 sales decreased 8 percent from the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to lower production rates on several programs. Second quarter sales for the F-16 Block 60 and MESA radar programs declined as hardware production for these programs winds down. Longbow missile sales were also lower as this program nears completion. Second quarter 2006 sales also reflect the divestiture of Interconnect Technologies.
 
Electronics second quarter 2006 operating margin decreased 9 percent from the second quarter of 2005, corresponding to the decreased sales volume, with improved program performance in some areas and lower expense for amortization of purchased intangibles offsetting forward loss provisions on two fixed-price development programs.
 
Ships
 
 
Ships second quarter 2006 sales decreased 9 percent from the second quarter of 2005 and included higher sales in submarine and carrier programs, which were offset by lower volume on the DDG 1000 program (formerly known as the DD(X) program) and hurricane-related work delays on the LPD, LHD and DDG programs.
 
Ships operating margin increased 26 percent from the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to material incentives and improved performance for the Virginia-class Block II submarine program.
