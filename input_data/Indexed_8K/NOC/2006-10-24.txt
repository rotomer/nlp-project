Northrop Grumman Reports Third Quarter 2006 Results
Contract Acquisitions Increase 25 Percent to $6.3 Billion
Sales Increase 2 Percent to $7.4 Billion
Segment Operating Margin Increases 43 Percent to $696 Million
Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Up 9 Percent to $0.87 after $0.20 per Share Legal Provision
Cash from Operations Increases 8 Percent to $962 Million
2006 and 2007 Guidance Provided
     LOS ANGELES  Oct. 24, 2006  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) third quarter 2006 income from continuing operations rose 5 percent to $306 million from $291 million in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 9 percent to $0.87 from $0.80 for the same period of 2005. Third quarter 2006 income from continuing operations includes a $112.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, pre-tax provision for the company's settlement offer to resolve all potential claims by the U.S. Department of Justice and a classified customer related to certain microelectronic parts produced by the Space and Electronics sector of the former TRW Inc.
     Third quarter 2006 sales increased 2 percent to $7.4 billion from $7.3 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter operating results for 2006 and 2005 reflect the reclassification of certain operations from continuing to discontinued operations.
     "Our four businesses delivered another very strong operating quarter, in line with our expectations," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman and chief executive officer. "Contract acquisitions rose 25 percent and all four businesses ended the quarter with higher year-over-year backlog. Segment operating margin rose 43 percent, driven by higher sales in three of our four businesses and higher operating margin in all four businesses. Information & Services and Aerospace posted double-digit growth in operating margin and substantially higher margin rates. While we're disappointed to
 
have a legal provision detract from the strong results, we believe this settlement offer is in the best interests of all the parties and our shareholders.
     "We also had a great quarter from a cash perspective, generating nearly $1 billion in cash from operations. 2006 is shaping up to be another year in which Northrop Grumman delivers substantially higher margin and generates solid cash. Our strong financial performance continues to support our balanced cash deployment strategy and provides a solid foundation for 2007 and beyond," continued Sugar.
     The company's third quarter 2006 segment operating margin increased 43 percent to $696 million from $486 million in the third quarter of 2005. All of the company's businesses  Information & Services, Aerospace, Electronics and Ships  generated higher operating profit in the 2006 third quarter than in the same period in 2005, with double-digit increases in operating margin in Information & Services, Aerospace and Ships. Third quarter 2005 results included a $150 million charge in Ships for Hurricane Katrina-related cost growth.
     Third quarter 2006 unallocated expenses increased to $140 million from $42 million in the 2005 third quarter. In the third quarter of 2006, the company recorded a $112.5 million pre-tax provision for its settlement offer and associated expenses. As previously reported, in October 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice and a classified government customer notified the company of potential substantial claims relating to certain microelectronics parts produced by the Space and Electronics sector of the former TRW Inc. In the third quarter of 2006, the company and the customer commenced settlement discussions. While the company believes it acted appropriately in this matter, the company offered a settlement to resolve all potential claims, avoid litigation, and to recognize the value of the customer relationship. This quarter's pre-tax provision reflects the company's settlement offer and related expenses. The company is not able to predict the outcome of this matter at this time.
     Operating margin increased 25 percent to $546 million from $438 million in the third quarter of 2005.
     Net interest expense for the 2006 third quarter declined to $73 million from $93 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in the 2006 period.
     Other income/expense for the 2006 third quarter was income of $1 million compared with income of $94 million in the prior year period. The 2005 third quarter results included an $81 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a non-core equity holding.
     The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2006 third quarter was 35.4 percent compared with 33.7 percent in the 2005 third quarter. The company now expects an effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent for 2006 compared with its prior guidance of 31 to 32 percent.
 
     Net income for the 2006 third quarter increased 3 percent to $302 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, from $293 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 351 million for the third quarter of 2006 and 362.2 million for the third quarter of 2005.
     Contract acquisitions increased 25 percent to $6.3 billion in the third quarter of 2006 from $5 billion for the same period of 2005. All four businesses ended the quarter with higher funded backlog than in the prior year period, with Ships and Information & Services increasing 28 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, increased 7 percent to $59.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2006 compared with $55.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2005.
Cash Measurements, Debt and Share Repurchases
     Cash provided by operations in the third quarter of 2006 totaled $962 million compared with cash provided by operations of $891 million in the third quarter of 2005. Capital spending totaled $169 million in the 2006 third quarter, including $26 million for Hurricane Katrina capital expenditures at Ships, compared with total capital spending of $173 million in the 2005 third quarter. Since Aug. 29, 2005, hurricane-related insurance recoveries for damage, repair and restoration have totaled $264 million compared with total hurricane-related expenditures of $348 million.
     Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2006 compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2005. During the first nine months of the year the company reduced total debt by approximately $500 million and repurchased $825 million of its common stock, including approximately 11.6 million shares under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement.
     Under the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization announced in October 2005, approximately $175 million remains. The company is presently evaluating the timing of the completion of this repurchase authorization. Common shares outstanding totaled 345.1 million at Sept. 30, 2006.
2006 and 2007 Guidance
     For 2006, the company expects sales of approximately $30.2 billion compared with its prior guidance of approximately $30.5 billion, and earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.20 to $4.25 compared with its prior guidance of $4.35 to $4.45. The reduction to the company's guidance for 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the $0.20 per diluted share legal provision. In addition, as a result of the recently enacted Pension Protection Act of 2006, the company plans to pre-fund $800 million of its pension obligations in the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result of the planned pre-funding, the company now expects cash from operations of $1.5 to $1.8 billion compared with its prior guidance of $2.3 to $2.6 billion.
 
     For 2007, the company expects sales in the range of $31 to $32 billion and earnings per share to increase to a range of $4.65 to $4.90. Earnings per share guidance for 2007 is based on no changes in the pension assumptions from 2006. Cash from operations is expected to increase to between $2.5 and $2.8 billion in 2007.
Business Results
     Effective Jan. 1, 2006, the company established a new reportable segment, Technical Services, to leverage existing business strengths and synergies in logistics support, sustainment and technical services. On July 1, 2006, the company transferred additional business to Technical Services from Electronics, Integrated Systems, Mission Systems and Space Technology. Schedule 4 provides a reconciliation of these realignments, where applicable, with past financial reports.
     The company categorizes its seven reporting segments into four businesses. The results of the Mission Systems, Information Technology and Technical Services segments are aggregated as Information & Services. The results of the Integrated Systems and Space Technology segments are aggregated as Aerospace, and the Electronic Systems segment is reported as Electronics. The Newport News and Ship Systems sectors are reported as Ships.
     The company also revised its reporting of intercompany margin recognition and elimination for the company's operating segments. The operating information shown below includes intersegment sales and operating margin that eliminate in consolidation, as shown in Schedule 2.
Information & Services
     Information & Services sales increased 6 percent during the third quarter of 2006 due to higher sales in Technical Services and Information Technology, partially offset by lower sales in Mission Systems.
     The 42 percent sales increase in Technical Services reflects new business, primarily from the Nevada Test Site program. Information Technology sales increased 10 percent due to higher volume in Defense, Intelligence, and Commercial, State & Local programs. Defense and Intelligence sales increases reflect higher volume on several existing programs, with the most notable being the Network Centric Solutions program.
 
Higher Commercial, State & Local sales include revenue from new business, such as the Virginia and San Diego IT outsourcing programs. The sales decrease in Mission Systems reflects lower volume for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program and a restricted program.
     The 20 percent year-over-year increase in Information & Services operating margin includes higher operating margin from all three segments. Mission Systems operating margin increased 20 percent due to favorable program performance and lower expense for amortization of purchased intangibles. Technical Services operating margin increased 59 percent, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable program performance. Information Technology operating margin increased 10 percent due to higher sales volume.
Aerospace
     Third quarter 2006 Aerospace sales declined 6 percent from the third quarter of 2005. Integrated Systems sales decreased 6 percent due to lower volume from the E2-D Advanced Hawkeye and EA-18 Growler programs, partially offset by higher volume from the F/A-18 Hornet, F-35 Lightning II and restricted programs. Space Technology sales decreased 7 percent due to lower volume for the NPOESS weather satellite system and restricted programs. These declines were partially offset by higher sales for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, Advanced Extremely High Frequency communications satellite and Airborne Laser programs.
     Aerospace third quarter 2006 operating margin increased 10 percent from the third quarter of 2005 and includes higher operating margin at both Integrated Systems and Space Technology. Integrated Systems operating margin increased 15 percent over the prior year period due to higher volume and improved performance in the F/A-18 Hornet and F-35 Lightning II programs. Space Technology operating margin increased 1 percent due to the sale of a patent and improved performance in the Advanced Extremely High Frequency program.
 
Electronics
     Electronics third quarter 2006 sales increased 5 percent from the third quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher sales of automated flat sorting machines to the U.S. Postal Service, infrared countermeasures and navigation systems, partially offset by lower sales of bio-detection equipment. Third quarter 2005 sales include the results of Winchester Electronics and Interconnect Technologies, which were divested in 2006.
     Electronics third quarter 2006 operating margin increased 8 percent from the third quarter of 2005, reflecting higher sales volume and lower expense for amortization of purchased intangibles.
Ships
     Ships third quarter 2006 sales increased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2005 and included higher aircraft carrier sales, primarily driven by higher volume in the refueling program, as well as higher sales for the LHD and LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, DDG destroyers and Deepwater programs. Higher volume on these programs was offset by lower volume on the DDG 1000 program (formerly known as the DD(X) program).
Vinson
     Ships operating margin increased to $76 million from a loss of $65 million in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter 2005 operating margin included a $150 million charge for Hurricane Katrina-related cost growth as well as a negative impact of approximately $15 million due to hurricane-related work delays.
