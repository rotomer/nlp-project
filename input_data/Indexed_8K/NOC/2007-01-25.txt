     LOS ANGELES  Jan. 25, 2007  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported that fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations rose 37 percent to $457 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, from $334 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Income from continuing operations for 2006 increased 13 percent to $1.6 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share, from $1.4 billion, or $3.83 per diluted share, in 2005.
     Sales for the 2006 fourth quarter increased 5 percent to $8 billion from $7.7 billion in the 2005 fourth quarter. Sales for 2006 totaled $30.1 billion and are comparable to 2005. Fourth quarter and full year operating results for 2006 and 2005 reflect the reclassification of certain operations from continuing to discontinued operations.
 
     Cash from operations for the 2006 fourth quarter totaled $309 million compared with $660 million in the 2005 fourth quarter, and cash from operations for the year totaled $1.8 billion compared with $2.6 billion in 2005. Contract acquisitions in the 2006 fourth quarter increased 90 percent, to $12.2 billion. For all of 2006, contract acquisitions increased 58 percent to $38.8 billion, bringing funded backlog to $30.5 billion and total backlog to a record $61 billion at Dec. 31, 2006.
     "Our focus on performance generated another strong quarter and our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth in earnings per share. Together, our four businesses achieved solid double-digit growth in operating margin and outstanding cash generation, for both the quarter and the year," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman and chief executive officer. "Our focus on operating margin rate improvement resulted in an expansion of 80 basis points in operating margin rate in 2006 compared with 2005," he added.
     "For 2007, we are targeting solid earnings growth driven by higher sales and improving margin rates. Northrop Grumman's financial position continues to strengthen. Our record backlog gives us the foundation for future sales growth, and our outstanding balance sheet supports a cash deployment strategy that invests for the future and returns cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases," Sugar concluded.
2007 Guidance
     The company expects 2007 sales to range between $31 and $32 billion. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are expected to range between $4.80 and $5.05, and include estimated net pension income of approximately $70 million. The company's estimated pension expense for 2007 is based on a composite discount rate of 6 percent and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. The company's 2006 discount rate was 5.75 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to range between $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion in 2007.
Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
     Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations rose 37 percent to $457 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, from $334 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 sales rose 5 percent to $8 billion compared with $7.7 billion in the 2005 fourth quarter.
     Total segment operating margin rose 13 percent and includes double-digit percentage increases in operating margin in Information & Services, Electronics and Ships. Total operating margin for the 2006 fourth quarter increased 15 percent to $622 million from $539 million for the 2005 fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2006 includes a $61 million pre-tax forward loss provision for the Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar system fixed price development programs. Fourth quarter 2005 included a $65 million pre-tax forward loss provision for the F-16 Block 60 fixed price development program.
 
     Other income for the 2006 fourth quarter increased to $134 million from $17 million for the same period of 2005. The increase includes a $111 million pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately 9.7 million shares of TRW Automotive common stock.
     Federal and foreign income taxes for the 2006 fourth quarter increased to $230 million from $131 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to higher income in the 2006 fourth quarter. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2005 included a $20 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of prior years IRS appeals cases. The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for the 2006 fourth quarter was 33.5 percent compared with 28.2 percent in the 2005 fourth quarter.
     Net income for the 2006 fourth quarter increased 37 percent to $453 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, from $331 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the same period of 2005. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 359 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 358.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 weighted average shares outstanding include the dilutive impact of the company's Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.
     Weighted average diluted shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per diluted share and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are adjusted to reflect the assumed conversion of the company's Series B preferred stock if the effect is dilutive. For the fourth quarter of 2006 and the full year 2006, the assumed conversion of these shares was dilutive, and earnings per share amounts were adjusted to include the effects of an additional 6.4 million shares outstanding and the elimination of dividends on the preferred stock.
     Contract acquisitions for the 2006 fourth quarter increased to $12.2 billion from $6.4 billion for the same period of 2005. The increase in contract acquisitions includes higher acquisitions in all four businesses. Fourth quarter 2005 contract acquisitions were impacted by the delay in the passage of the 2006 defense budget. Total backlog, which includes funded backlog and firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer, was $61 billion at Dec. 31, 2006 compared with $56.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2005.
2006 Results
     Income from continuing operations for 2006 rose 13 percent to $1.6 billion, or $4.44 per diluted share, from $1.4 billion, or $3.83 per diluted share, for 2005. Sales for 2006 were comparable to 2005.

all four of the company's businesses, including double-digit percentage increases in Information & Services and Ships operating margin.
     Unallocated expenses increased $97 million in 2006 principally due to a $112.5 million pre-tax legal provision recorded in the third quarter of 2006. For 2006, net pension expense increased to $37 million from $21 million in 2005 due principally to higher FAS costs.
     Net interest expense for 2006 declined to $303 million from $334 million in 2005. The decrease primarily reflects lower average debt in 2006.
     Other income for 2006 declined to $125 million from $200 million in 2005. In 2006, the company sold approximately 9.7 million TRW Automotive shares for a pre-tax gain of $111 million. In 2005, the company sold non-core equity investments, which generated pre-tax gains totaling $165 million.
     The effective tax rate applied to income from continuing operations for 2006 was 31.2 percent compared with 32.4 percent for 2005.
     Net income for 2006 rose 10 percent to $1.5 billion, or $4.37 per diluted share, from $1.4 billion, or $3.85 per diluted share, in 2005. Earnings per share are based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 358.6 million for 2006 and 363.2 million for 2005. For 2006, weighted average shares outstanding include the dilutive impact of the company's Series B preferred stock.

Electronics
 
     Electronics fourth quarter 2006 sales increased 4 percent from the prior year period due to higher sales across several areas, including infrared countermeasures, bio-detection equipment, automated flat sorting machines for the U.S. Postal Service, and navigation systems. These increases were partially offset by lower sales for the F-16 Block 60 program, and sales adjustments resulting from the forward loss provisions on the MESA radar system fixed price development program.
     Electronics fourth quarter 2006 operating margin increased 21 percent from the prior year period and includes lower expense for amortization of purchased intangibles and improved program performance. Pre-tax forward loss provisions totaling $61 million for the MESA radar system programs (Wedgetail and Peace Eagle), partially offset the lower amortization and improved program performance.

     Electronics 2006 operating margin increased 6 percent due to lower expense for the amortization of purchased intangibles and favorable program performance, which was partially offset by forward loss provisions for the MESA and ASPIS II programs.
 
Ships
 
     Ships fourth quarter 2006 sales rose 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005 and included higher aircraft carrier sales, primarily driven by higher volume for the USS refueling program, higher revenue for the Coast Guard's Deepwater program, and continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Ships 2006 sales declined 8 percent from 2005 primarily due to lower sales for the DDG 1000 program (formerly known as the DD(X) program) and continued recovery from the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Sales declines in these programs were partially offset by higher sales for aircraft carrier and Coast Guard programs.
Carl Vinson
     Ships fourth quarter 2006 operating margin increased 14 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005. Ships fourth quarter operating margin includes a pension benefit resulting from the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and improved sales mix, partially offset by lower performance on the LHD program.
