LOS ANGELES  Jan. 24, 2008  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported fourth quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $457 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, unchanged from $457 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations included a pre-tax gain of $111 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, on the sale of approximately 9.7 million shares of TRW Automotive common stock.
          
For 2007, income from continuing operations increased 15 percent to $1.8 billion, or $5.16 per diluted share, from $1.6 billion, or $4.46 per diluted share, in 2006.
          
Fourth quarter 2007 sales increased 10 percent to $8.8 billion from $8.0 billion. For 2007, sales increased 6 percent to $32 billion from $30.1 billion in 2006. Fourth quarter and total year operating results for 2007 and 2006 reflect the reclassification of certain operations from continuing to discontinued operations.
          
Cash from operations for the 2007 fourth quarter increased to $734 million from $271 million in the 2006 fourth quarter, and cash from operations for the year increased to a record $2.9 billion from $1.8 billion in 2006. Fourth quarter and total year cash from operations was reduced by discretionary pension pre-funding of $200 million in 2007 and $800 million in 2006.
          
"This was an outstanding quarter across the board for Northrop Grumman and a great finish to 2007. For the quarter we achieved record sales, strong segment operating margin, and outstanding cash from operations and free cash flow. All four businesses performed well, posting double-digit increases in operating margin," said Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop Grumman chairman and chief executive officer.
 
          
"For 2007, we achieved record sales, operating margin, earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow, while increasing backlog $3 billion to $64 billion. We have a great foundation for the future. For 2008, the focus will continue to be on driving performance and executing our balanced cash deployment strategy. We expect continued sales and EPS growth with strong cash from operations and free cash flow. This solid outlook supports investments for the future and shareholder value-enhancing actions such as our new $2.5 billion share repurchase program," Sugar concluded.

As previously announced, beginning in the 2007 first quarter, Radio Systems is reported as part of Mission Systems. Schedule 6 of this earnings release provides previously reported quarterly financial results and realigned results reflecting the transfer of certain Electronics businesses to Mission Systems, effective January 1, 2008. Operating results for all periods presented reflect the reclassification of Interconnect Technologies (formerly reported in Electronics) from continuing to discontinued operations.
 
Information & Services
     Information & Services fourth quarter 2007 sales increased $340 million and 2007 sales increased $1.3 billion. Sales for both the quarter and year increased 11 percent. Improvements in sales for both the fourth quarter and 2007 reflect higher sales for all three business segments.
     Information & Services fourth quarter operating margin increased $27 million, or 12 percent, and as a percent of sales was comparable to the prior year period. For 2007, operating margin increased $34 million, or 3 percent, and as a percent of sales declined to 8.1 percent from 8.7 percent in 2006. The 2007 operating margin rate reflects the impact of a higher percentage of, and lower margin on, commercial, state and local business than in 2006, as well as the impact of higher revenue for the Nevada Test Site program.
     Mission Systems fourth quarter sales increased $161 million, or 11 percent, and 2007 sales increased $437 million, or 8 percent. Higher sales for both the fourth quarter and 2007 reflect the Essex Corporation acquisition, higher volume for missile defense programs, and higher volume for command, control & communications programs.
     Fourth quarter operating margin rose $24 million, or 20 percent, and as a percent of sales, increased to 9.1 percent from 8.5 percent in the prior year period. For 2007, operating margin rose $47 million or 9 percent, and as a percent of sales was comparable to the prior year period at 9.5 percent. Higher operating margin and margin rate for the fourth quarter are primarily driven by higher volume and improved performance for several programs. Higher operating margin for 2007 is primarily driven by higher volume.
 
     Information Technology fourth quarter sales rose $164 million, or 16 percent, and 2007 sales increased $524 million, or 13 percent. Higher sales for both the fourth quarter and 2007 are largely due to higher volume for commercial, state and local programs, defense programs, and restricted intelligence programs, which is partially offset by lower volume for civilian agencies programs.
     Information Technology fourth quarter 2007 operating margin declined $5 million, or 6 percent, and as a percent of sales declined to 6.8 percent from 8.3 percent. For 2007, operating margin declined $13 million or 4 percent, and as a percent of sales declined to 7.3 percent from 8.6 percent. The declines in operating margin and margin rate for the fourth quarter and 2007 are principally due to a business mix that includes a higher percentage of lower margin revenue for commercial, state and local programs and higher year-end cost accruals. For 2007, performance on state and local IT outsourcing programs was lower than the prior year periods due to timing of expenses and growth in transition cost (including $22 million in increased amortization of deferred and other outsourcing costs in Q3 2007).
     Technical Services fourth quarter sales rose $15 million, or 3 percent, and 2007 sales rose $319 million, or 17 percent. Higher fourth quarter sales are due to higher volume for life cycle optimization and engineering programs (LCOE). For 2007, higher sales are due to the Nevada Test Site program, which commenced in the second quarter of 2006, and higher volume for LCOE programs.
     Fourth quarter operating margin rose $8 million, or 33 percent, and as a percent of sales, increased to 6 percent from 4.6 percent in the prior year period. Higher operating margin and improved margin rate in the fourth quarter are due to higher volume and favorable contract adjustments. For 2007, operating margin is unchanged at $120 million, and as a percent of sales declined to 5.5 percent from 6.5 percent in 2006. The decline in operating margin rate reflects the impact of revenue for the Nevada Test Site program for a full year, and lower performance on LCOE programs.
 
Aerospace
     Aerospace fourth quarter 2007 sales increased $29 million, or 1 percent, and include higher volume for Space Technology, which was partially offset by lower volume for Integrated Systems. For 2007, sales declined $223 million, or 3 percent, from 2006 due to lower volume for Integrated Systems.
     Aerospace fourth quarter 2007 operating margin increased $25 million, or 13 percent, and as a percent of sales increased to 9.7 percent from 8.7 percent in the prior year period. For 2007, operating margin increased $56 million, or 7 percent, and as a percent of sales increased to 10.4 percent from 9.5 percent in 2006. The improvement in fourth quarter 2007 margin rate reflects improved performance for both Integrated Systems and Space Technology, and for 2007 is primarily driven by improved performance for Integrated Systems.
     Integrated Systems fourth quarter sales declined $78 million, or 6 percent. For 2007 sales declined $433 million, or 8 percent. Sales declines for both periods are primarily due to lower volume for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, F-35 and EA-18G programs, as these programs transition from development to production, as well as significant customer-directed scope reductions associated with the E-10A platform and related MP-RTIP efforts. Lower volume in these programs is partially offset by higher volume for the B-2, F/A-18 and Global Hawk programs.
     Integrated Systems fourth quarter operating margin rose $12 million, or 10 percent, and as a percent of sales, increased to 10.5 percent from 9 percent in the prior year period. Higher fourth quarter operating margin and margin rate include performance improvements and contract close-outs for several programs, as well as an additional F/A-18 delivery, which more than offset the impact of lower volume.
 
     For 2007, operating margin increased $40 million, or 7 percent, and as a percent of sales increased to 11.7 percent from 10 percent in 2006. The improvements in operating margin and margin rate include the impact of a $27 million adjustment related to the settlement of prior years overhead costs, performance improvements and contract close-outs for several programs, and three additional F/A-18 deliveries, which more than offset the impact of lower sales.
     Space Technology fourth quarter sales increased $107 million, or 14 percent, and for 2007 increased $210 million or 7 percent. Higher sales volume in both periods is primarily driven by higher volume for restricted programs and civil systems, partially offset by lower volume in the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) program.
     Space Technology fourth quarter operating margin increased $13 million, or 21 percent, and as a percent of sales increased to 8.6 percent from 8.1 percent in the prior year period. For 2007, operating margin increased $16 million, or 7 percent, and as a percent of sales is comparable to 2006. The improvement in fourth quarter operating margin and margin rate is driven by higher volume, as well as improved performance on satellite communications programs as a result of risk retirement. For 2007, the increase in operating margin is primarily driven by higher volume.
Electronics
     Electronics fourth quarter 2007 sales rose $139 million, or 8 percent, and for 2007 rose $363 million, or 6 percent. The fourth quarter sales improvement was primarily driven by higher volume for electro-optical targeting and infrared countermeasures programs, communications and ISR programs, and navigation systems. For 2007, the sales increase is primarily driven by higher volume for land forces programs, electro-optical targeting and infrared countermeasures programs, communications and ISR programs, and a restricted program. Higher sales in these programs are partially offset by declining volume on fixed price development programs.
     Electronics fourth quarter 2007 operating margin increased $32 million, or 16 percent, and as a percent of sales, increased to 12.1 percent from 11.3 percent in the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2006 operating margin included a $61 million pre-tax forward loss provision for the MESA radar systems programs. For 2007, operating margin increased $59 million, or 8 percent, and as a percent of sales increased to 11.8
 
percent from 11.5 percent in 2006. The increase in operating margin and margin rate reflect higher volume as well as improved performance across several programs.
Ships
     Ships fourth quarter 2007 sales rose $291 million, or 19 percent, and for 2007, sales rose $467 million, or 9 percent from 2006. The increase in fourth quarter sales includes higher revenue for the LPD, LHD, LHA, DDG and submarine programs. Fourth quarter 2007 sales also include $56 million from AMSEC. AMSEC was reorganized in July 2007, and the businesses retained under the reorganization are now reported in the Ships segment. The increase in 2007 sales is primarily driven by higher volume for the LPD and LHA programs, as well as higher volume for U.S. Coast Guard, aircraft carrier and submarine programs. Sales in 2007 include $92 million from AMSEC.
     Ships fourth quarter 2007 operating margin increased $22 million, or 18 percent, from the prior year period, and as a percent of sales was comparable to the prior period at 7.9 percent. The increase in fourth quarter 2007 operating margin over the prior year period is driven by higher volume.
     For 2007, operating margin increased $145 million, or 37 percent, and as a percent of sales increased 190 basis points to 9.3 percent from 7.4 percent in 2006. The increase in 2007 operating margin and margin rate are driven by higher volume, risk reduction upon completion of several contract actions, continued progress in recovery from Hurricane Katrina (including a $62 million pre-tax insurance recovery related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the company's Gulf Coast shipyards), performance improvements, and a $23 million pre-tax gain resulting from the AMSEC reorganization.
