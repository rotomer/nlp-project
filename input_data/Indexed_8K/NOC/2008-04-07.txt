The company redeemed 17,947 shares of Preferred Stock for approximately 23,300 shares of Common Stock.
As previously announced, prior to the mandatory redemption, Preferred Stock holders could elect to convert each share of Preferred Stock into 1.822267 shares of Common Stock at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., EDT, on April 3, 2008.
