On February 16, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation (the "Company") took the actions described below with regard to the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, with the exception of the Chairman Emeritus and the Chief Executive Officer and President; and on February 17, 2010 the Independent Members of the Board of Directors took the actions described below with regard to the Chairman Emeritus and the Chief Executive Officer and President:
     (a) The Compensation Committee approved base salary adjustments for 2010 and cash bonus compensation for performance in 2009 as follows:
Dr. Sugar retired from the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer December 31, 2009. He received cash bonus compensation of $2,668,750 for performance in 2009.
Mr. Bush's salary was effective January 1, 2010 in connection with his election to the position of Chief Executive Officer and President.
     (b) Approved the 2010 goals under the 2002 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP"). Under the ICP, participants will earn cash bonus compensation based upon the Company Performance Factor (the "CPF") and an Individual Performance Factor ("IPF"). Each participant's target award is based on a percentage of base salary, and awards are paid in the year following the performance period. The 2010 financial measures for the ICP are based on new business awards, operating margin rate before net FAS/CAS pension expense, and the rate of conversion of net income to free cash flow (excluding voluntary pension prefunding). The 2010 ICP also includes consideration of non-financial metrics deemed to be critical to the operating performance of the company. Target percentages for 2010 are unchanged and are as follows: Mr. Bush  150%, Mr. Palmer  75%, Mr. Ervin  75%, and Mr. Pitts  75%.
The Compensation Committee also approved changing one of the metrics for the Restricted Performance Stock Rights with a performance period of 2010-2012 from operating margin rate and return on net assets to relative total shareholder return for members of the Corporate Policy Council ("CPC").
At this meeting the Committee also approved the following:
A stock holding requirement for Restricted Performance Stock Rights, Restricted Stock Rights, and Options granted pursuant to the Company's 2001 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan. This stock holding requirement requires elected and appointed officers to hold 50% of the net shares received upon exercise or payment of these awards for at least a three year period following exercise or payment. The requirement does not apply to the extent an award is exercised or paid more than one year after the award holder's retirement or other termination of employment. These restrictions apply to awards granted in 2010 and in subsequent years.
Effective January 1, 2011, for all participants, the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan is closed for future contributions. Executive and Company contributions to the Savings Excess Plan will be capped at $5 million on a cumulative basis for all CPC members.

Section 2.03
Place of Meetings
          (a)     Each annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be held at such location as may be determined by the Board of Directors or, if no such determination is made, at such place as may be determined by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. If no location is so determined, the annual or special meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that an annual meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized by Section 2.03(b).
 
          (b)     If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication:

                   (2)     be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication; provided that (A) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder, (B) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action is maintained by the Corporation.
          . .
Section 2.04
Notice of Meetings
          (a)     Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each annual or special meeting of stockholders stating the date and time when, the place, if any, where it is to be held, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the information required to gain access to the list of stockholders entitled to vote, if such list is to be open for examination on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. The purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called may, in the case of an annual meeting, and shall, in the case of a special meeting, also be stated. If mailed, notice is given when it is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to a stockholder at such stockholder's address as it shall appear on the records of the Corporation.
          (b)     Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the "Certificate") or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive
 
notice, (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper that creates a record the recipient may retain, retrieve and review and reproduce in paper form through an automated process.
          (c)     Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, but subject to Section 233(d) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereof), any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice described in the preceding sentence, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
          . . Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL or the Certificate or these Bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Section 2.05
Waiver of Notice
          . . When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, then notice of the place, if any, date and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, shall be given in conformity herewith. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the DGCL, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Section 2.06
Adjourned Meetings
          . . All annual and special meetings of stockholders shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and procedures as the Board of Directors may determine subject to the requirements of applicable law and, as to matters not governed by such rules and procedures, as the chairperson of such meeting shall determine. Such rules or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairperson of such
Section 2.07
Conduct of Meetings
 
meeting, may include without limitation the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting, (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairperson of the meeting shall determine, (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof, and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
          The chairperson of any annual or special meeting of stockholders shall be either the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or any person designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary, a person designated by the chairperson of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.
          . . Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to the Corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of record of the Corporation (the "Record Stockholder") at the time of the giving of the notice required in the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (c) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring nominations or business (other than business included in the Corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) before an annual meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.08
Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations
          For nominations or business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the Record Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, (2) any such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under applicable law, and (3) the Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, must have acted in accordance with the representations set forth in the Solicitation Statement required by these Bylaws. To be timely, a Record Stockholder's notice shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 or more than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the annual meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the Record Stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 135th day before such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the Corporation at least 10 days before the last day a Record Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the
 
preceding sentence, a Record Stockholder's notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall an adjournment of an annual meeting, or the postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described herein.
          Such Record Stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) if such notice pertains to the nomination of directors, as to each person whom the Record Stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director (i) all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected, and (ii) a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for reelection at any future meeting at which such person would face reelection and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Corporation's Principles of Corporate Governance; (b) as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party") (i) the name and address of each such party, as they appear on the Corporation's books; (ii) the class, series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by each such party (which information set forth in this clause shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than 10 days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting to disclose such ownership as of such record date); (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination between or among such stockholder and such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing; (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such Record Stockholder or such beneficial owners, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder and such beneficial owner, with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation (which information set forth in this clause shall be supplemented by such party not later than 10 days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the special meeting to disclose such ownership as of such record date); (v) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; (vi) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting; and (vii) a statement whether or not each such party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares
 
of capital stock of the Corporation required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or the beneficial holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder and/or intends otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination (such statement, a "Solicitation Statement").
          Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.08 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.08. The chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
          Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting in accordance with Section 2.02. The notice of such special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the Secretary setting forth the information set forth in clauses (a) and (c) of the third paragraph of this Section 2.08. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 135th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment of a special meeting, or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a record stockholder's notice. A person shall not be eligible for election or reelection as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by a record stockholder in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.08.
          For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.08, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
 
thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.08. Nothing in this Section 2.08 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
          . . At any meeting of stockholders, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the voting power of the shares then issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to the vote on that matter. In the absence of a quorum, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time. At any reconvened meeting following such an adjournment at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Section 2.09
Quorum
          . . When a quorum is present at a meeting, a matter submitted for stockholder action shall be approved if the votes cast "for" the matter exceed the votes cast "against" such matter, unless a greater or different vote is required by statute, any applicable law or regulation (including the applicable rules of any stock exchange), the rights of any authorized class of stock, the Certificate or these Bylaws. Unless the Certificate or a resolution of the Board of Directors adopted in connection with the issuance of shares of any class or series of stock provides for a greater or lesser number of votes per share, or limits or denies voting rights, each outstanding share of stock, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.
Section 2.10
Votes Required
          . . A stockholder may vote the shares owned of record by such stockholder either in person or by proxy in any manner permitted by law, including by execution of a proxy in writing or by telex, telegraph, cable, facsimile or electronic transmission, by the stockholder or by the duly authorized officer, director, employee or agent of such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after 3 years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy will be irrevocable if it states it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.
Section 2.11
Proxies
          Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
          . . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, unless the Board of Directors authorizes such action to be taken by the written consent of the holders of outstanding shares of stock having not less than the minimum voting power that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
Section 2.12
Stockholder Action
 
meeting of stockholders at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, provided all other requirements of applicable law and the Certificate have been satisfied.
          . . The Secretary of the Corporation shall, in the manner provided by law, prepare and make (or cause to be prepared and made) a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of, and the number of shares registered in the name of, each stockholder. Nothing contained in this section shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. A list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall also be produced and kept at the time and place, if any, of the meeting during the duration thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list will also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list will be provided with the notice of the meeting.
Section 2.13
List of Stockholders
          The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
          . . In advance of any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may appoint Inspectors of Election to act at such meeting or at any adjournment or adjournments thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If such inspectors are not so appointed or fail or refuse to act, the chairperson of any such meeting may (and, to the extent required by law, shall) make such an appointment. The number of Inspectors of Election shall be 1 or 3. If there are 3 Inspectors of Election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority shall be effective and shall represent the decision, act or certificate of all. No such inspector need be a stockholder of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability.
Section 2.14
Inspectors of Election
          The Inspectors of Election shall have such duties and responsibilities as required under Section 231 of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereof).
          . . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.
Section 3.01
Powers
 
          . . Except as otherwise fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of Article Fourth of the Certificate in connection with rights to elect additional directors under specified circumstances which may be granted to the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors shall consist of fourteen (14) authorized directorships.
Section 3.02
Number
          At any time the Chairperson of the Board of Directors is not independent as that term is defined under the then applicable rules and regulations of each national securities exchange upon which shares of the stock of the Corporation are listed for trading and of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the independent directors may designate from among them a Lead Independent Director having the duties and responsibilities set forth in the applicable rules of each such national securities exchange and as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors from time to time.
Section 3.03. Lead Independent Director.
          . . Except as provided in Section 3.07 hereof and subject to the right to elect additional directors under specified circumstances which may be granted, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of Article Fourth of the Certificate, to the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock, directors shall be elected by the stockholders of the Corporation for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders following their election. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with Section 2.08 of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the 10th day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
Section 3.04
Election and Term of Office
          . . Any director may resign at any time by submitting a resignation to the Corporation in writing or by electronic transmission. Such resignation shall take effect at the time of its receipt by the Corporation unless such resignation is effective at a future time or upon the happening of a future event or events in which case it shall be effective at such time or upon the happening of such event or events. Unless the resignation provides otherwise, the acceptance of a resignation shall not be required to make it effective.

Each person who was or is made a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any actual or threatened action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that (i) he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation (hereinafter an "indemnitee") or (ii) he or she is or was serving at the request of the Board of Directors or an executive officer (as such term is defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act) of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, or by other applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith. The right to indemnification provided by this Article shall apply whether or not the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as such director, officer, employee or agent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.01 to the contrary, except as provided in Section 5.03 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Corporation.
Section 5.01
Right to Indemnification
          . . The right to indemnification conferred in Section 5.01, shall include the right to have the expenses incurred in defending or preparing for any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses") paid by the Corporation; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is to be rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking containing such terms and conditions, including the requirement of security, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate (hereinafter an
Section 5.02
Advancement of Expenses
 
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article or otherwise. The Corporation shall not be obligated to advance fees and expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent in connection with a proceeding instituted by the Corporation against such person.
          . . If a claim under Section 5.01 or 5.02 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses under Section 5.02, in which case the applicable period shall be 30 calendar days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If the indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article V or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 5.03
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
          . . (a) The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provisions of the Certificate, Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. (b) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any past or present director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL. The Corporation may enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article. (c) The Corporation may without reference
Section 5.04
Nonexclusivity of Rights
 
to Sections 5.01 through 5.04 (a) and (b) hereof, pay the expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation who is subpoenaed, interviewed or deposed as a witness or otherwise incurs expenses in connection with any civil, arbitration, criminal or administrative proceeding or governmental or internal investigation to which the Corporation is a party, target, or potentially a party or target, or of any such individual who appears as a witness at any trial, proceeding or hearing to which the Corporation is a party, if the Corporation determines that such payments will benefit the Corporation and if, at the time such expenses are incurred by such individual and paid by the Corporation, such individual is not a party, and is not threatened to be made a party, to such proceeding or investigation.
          . . The Corporation may grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, authorize one or more officers to grant rights for indemnification or the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation on such terms and conditions as such officers deem appropriate.
Section 5.05
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
          . . The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article V shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article V that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
Section 5.06
Nature of Rights
          . . The Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation (or, if such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the procedures required by the Corporation in Section 6.07 shall have been followed). To the extent shares of capital stock are represented by certificates, such certificates shall be signed by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the President or a vice president, together with the Secretary or assistant secretary, or the Treasurer or assistant treasurer. Any or all of the signatures on any certificate may be facsimile. A stockholder that holds a certificate representing shares of any class or series of the capital stock of the Corporation for which the Board of Directors has authorized uncertificated shares may request that the Corporation cancel such certificate and issue such shares in an uncertificated form, provided that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue any uncertificated shares of capital stock to such stockholder until such certificate representing such shares of capital stock
Section 6.01
Shares of Stock
 
shall have been surrendered to the Corporation (or, if such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the procedures required by the Corporation in Section 6.07 shall have been followed).
          With respect to certificated shares of capital stock, the Secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent thereof shall mark every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the Corporation with "Cancelled" and the date of cancellation.
          In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The Corporation shall not have power to issue a certificate in bearer form.
          If the Corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.04 or Section 202 of the DGCL, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. In the case of uncertificated shares, within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to this section, Sections 6.02(b), 6.04 and 6.05 of these Bylaws and Sections 156, 202(a) and 218(a) of the DGCL, or with respect to this section and Section 151 of the DGCL a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
          . .
Section 6.02
Issuance of Stock; Lawful Consideration
          (a)     Shares of stock may be issued for such consideration, having a value not less than the par value thereof, as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Treasury shares may be disposed of by the Corporation for such consideration as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The consideration for subscriptions to, or the purchase of, the capital stock to be issued by the Corporation shall be paid in such form and in such manner as the Board of Directors shall determine. The Board of Directors may authorize capital stock to be issued for consideration consisting of cash, any tangible or intangible property or any benefit to the Corporation, or any combination thereof. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board of Directors as to the value of such consideration shall be conclusive. The capital stock so issued shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable stock upon receipt by the Corporation of such consideration; provided, however, nothing contained
 
herein shall prevent the Board of Directors from issuing partly paid shares in accordance with Section 6.02(b) and Section 156 of the DGCL.
          (b)     The Corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the Corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the Corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
          . . The Corporation may have one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars of its stock whose respective duties the Board of Directors or the Secretary may, from time to time, define. No certificate of stock shall be valid until countersigned by a transfer agent, if the Corporation has a transfer agent, or until registered by a registrar, if the Corporation has a registrar. The duties of transfer agent and registrar may be combined.
Section 6.03
Transfer Agents and Registrars
          . . A written restriction or restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of a security of the Corporation, or on the amount of the Corporation's securities that may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by Section 202 of the DGCL and noted conspicuously on the certificate or certificates representing the security or securities so restricted or, in the case of uncertificated shares, contained in the notice or notices sent pursuant to Section 6.02 of these Bylaws and Section 151(f) of the DGCL, may be enforced against the holder of the restricted security or securities or any successor or transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of the holder. Unless noted conspicuously on the certificate or certificates representing the security or securities so restricted or, in the case of uncertificated shares, contained in the notice or notices sent pursuant to Section 6.02 of these Bylaws and Sections 151(f) of the DGCL, a restriction, even though permitted by Section 202 of the DGCL, is ineffective except against a person with actual knowledge of the restriction.
Section 6.04
Restrictions on Transfer and Ownership of Securities
          . . One stockholder or two or more stockholders may by agreement in writing deposit capital stock of the Corporation of an original issue with or transfer capital stock of the Corporation to any person or persons, or entity or entities authorized to act as trustee, for the purpose of vesting in such person or persons, entity or entities, who may be designated voting trustee, or voting trustees, the right to vote thereon for any period of time determined by such agreement, upon the terms and conditions stated in such agreement. The agreement may contain any other lawful provisions not inconsistent with such purpose. After the filing of a copy of the agreement in the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware, which copy shall be open to the inspection of any stockholder of the Corporation or any beneficiary of the trust under the agreement daily during business hours, certificates of stock or uncertificated stock shall be issued to the voting trustee or trustees to represent any stock of an original issue so deposited with such voting trustee or trustees, and any certificates of stock or uncertificated stock so transferred to the voting trustee or trustees shall be
Section 6.05
Voting Trusts and Voting Agreements
 
surrendered and cancelled and new certificates or uncertificated stock shall be issued therefor to the voting trustee or trustees. In the certificate so issued, if any, it shall be stated that it is issued pursuant to such agreement, and that fact shall also be stated in the stock ledger of the Corporation. The voting trustee or trustees may vote the stock so issued or transferred during the period specified in the agreement. Stock standing in the name of the voting trustee or trustees may be voted either in person or by proxy, and in voting the stock, the voting trustee or trustees shall incur no responsibility as stockholder, trustee or otherwise, except for their own individual malfeasance. In any case where two or more persons or entities are designated as voting trustees, and the right and method of voting any stock standing in their names at any meeting of the Corporation are not fixed by the agreement appointing the trustees, the right to vote the stock and the manner of voting it at the meeting shall be determined by a majority of the trustees, or if they be equally divided as to the right and manner of voting the stock in any particular case, the vote of the stock in such case shall be divided equally among the trustees.
          . . Registration of transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation may be effected on the books of the Corporation in the following manner:
Section 6.06
Transfer of Shares
          (a)     .

Whenever a certificate is endorsed by or accompanied by a stock power executed by someone other than the person or persons named in the certificate, evidence of authority to transfer shall also be submitted with the certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such surrender, proper form for transfer or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the Corporation determine to waive such requirement.
Certificated Shares
          (b)     . In the case of uncertificated shares of stock, upon receipt of proper and duly executed transfer instructions from the registered holder of such shares, or by his attorney authorized by a power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or with a designated transfer agent or transfer clerk, the payment of all transfer taxes thereon, and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form. Whenever such transfer instructions are executed by someone other than the person or persons named in the books of the Corporation as the holder thereof, evidence of authority to transfer shall also be submitted with such transfer instructions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such payment of taxes or compliance shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the Corporation determine to waive such requirement.
Uncertificated Shares
          No transfer of shares of capital stock shall be made on the books of this Corporation if such transfer is in violation of a lawful restriction noted conspicuously on the certificate.

          . . The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in place of any certificate previously issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares; but the Corporation, in its discretion, may refuse to issue a new certificate of stock unless the Corporation is ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction.

          . . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may, except as otherwise required by law, fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.09 at the adjourned meeting.

          In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
