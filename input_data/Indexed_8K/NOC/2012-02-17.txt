Exhibit 10.1
[3-Year Cliff Vesting With Retirement Provision]
These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") apply to certain "Restricted Stock Rights" ("RSRs") granted by Northrop Grumman Corporation (the "Company") in 2012 under its 2011 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan. If you were granted an RSR award by the Company in 2012, the date of grant of your RSR award (the "Grant Date") and the number of RSRs applicable to your award are set forth in the letter from the Company announcing your RSR award (your "Grant Letter") and are also reflected in the electronic stock plan award recordkeeping system ("Stock Plan System") maintained by the Company or its designee. These Terms apply only with respect to the 2012 RSR award. If you were granted an RSR award, you are referred to as the "Grantee" with respect to your award. Capitalized terms are generally defined in Section 10 below if not otherwise defined herein.
Each RSR represents a right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, or cash of equivalent value as provided herein, subject to vesting as provided herein. The number of RSRs subject to your award is subject to adjustment as provided herein. The RSR award is subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, and is further subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, and any rules adopted by the Committee, as such rules are in effect from time to time.
 
Subject to Sections 2 and 5 below, one hundred percent (100%) of the number of RSRs (and any Dividend Equivalents (as defined below)) subject to your award (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.1) shall vest upon the third anniversary of the Grant Date.
. Except as otherwise provided below, the Company shall pay an RSR subject to the award that vests ("Vested RSR") (and related Dividend Equivalents) within 90 days following the vesting of the RSR on the third anniversary of the Grant Date. The Company shall pay such Vested RSRs in either an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, or, in the discretion of the Committee, in cash or in a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash. In the event of a cash payment, the amount of the payment for each Vested RSR to be paid in cash will equal the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of a share of Common Stock as of the date that such RSR became vested. No fractional shares will be issued.
1.1
Payment of RSRs
. The Grantee shall be entitled to payment for Dividend Equivalents (if any) with respect to any Vested RSRs. For purposes of these Terms, "Dividend Equivalents" means the aggregate amount of dividends paid by the Company on a number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the number of Vested RSRs during the period from the Grant date until the date the Vested RSRs are paid (without interest or other adjustments to reflect the time value of money). Dividend Equivalents (if any) will be paid at the same time as the Vested RSRs to which they relate are paid. Dividend Equivalents will be paid in cash.
1.2
Dividend Equivalents
.The RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award, to the extent not previously vested, shall terminate and become null and void if and when (a) the award terminates in connection with a Change in Control pursuant to Section 5 below, or (b) except as provided in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, and in Section 5, the Grantee ceases for any reason to be an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries.
2.1
General
. Unless the Committee otherwise provides (at the time of the leave or otherwise), if the Grantee is granted a leave of absence by the Company, the Grantee (a) shall not be deemed to have incurred a termination of employment at the time such leave commences for purposes of the award, and (b) shall be deemed to be employed by the Company for the duration of such approved leave of absence for purposes of the award. A termination of employment shall be deemed to have occurred if the Grantee does not timely return to active employment upon the expiration of such approved leave or if the Grantee commences a leave that is not approved by the Company.
2.2
Leave of Absence
. Subject to Section 2.2 above, the term "employment" as used herein means active employment by the Company and salary continuation without active employment (other than a leave of absence approved by the Company that is covered by Section 2.2) will not, in and of itself, constitute "employment" for purposes hereof (in the case of salary continuation without active employment, the Grantee's cessation of active employee status shall, subject to Section 2.2, be deemed to be a termination of "employment" for purposes hereof). Furthermore, salary
2.3
Salary Continuation
 
 
continuation will not, in and of itself, constitute a leave of absence approved by the Company for purposes of the award.
. For purposes of the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award, a termination of employment of the Grantee shall be deemed to have occurred if the Grantee is employed by a subsidiary or business unit and that subsidiary or business unit is sold, spun off, or otherwise divested, the Grantee does not otherwise continue to be employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries after such event, and the divested entity or business (or its successor or a parent company) does not assume the award in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a termination of employment, the termination shall be deemed to be an Early Retirement unless the Grantee was otherwise eligible at the time of termination for Normal Retirement (in which case, the termination shall be considered a Normal Retirement) treated as provided for in Section 2.7 (subject to Section 5).
2.4
Sale or Spinoff of Subsidiary or Business Unit
. Except as expressly provided in Section 2.6, Section 2.7 and in Section 5, the vesting of the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award requires continued employment through the third anniversary of the Grant Date as a condition to the vesting of any portion of the award. Employment for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Grantee to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment. Nothing contained in these Terms, the Stock Plan System, or the Plan constitutes an employment commitment by the Company or any subsidiary, affects the Grantee's status (if the Grantee is otherwise an at-will employee) as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any subsidiary, or interferes in any way with the right of the Company or of any subsidiary to terminate such employment at any time.
2.5
Continuance of Employment Required
. If the Grantee dies or incurs a Disability while employed by the Company or a subsidiary and such death or Disability occurs more than six months after the Grant Date, the outstanding and previously unvested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall vest as of the date of the Grantee's death or Disability, as applicable. RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) vesting under this Section shall be paid in the calendar year containing the 75
2.6
Death or Disability
th
day (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day) following the earlier of (a) Grantee's death or (b) Grantee's Disability. In the event of the Grantee's death prior to the delivery of shares or other payment with respect to any vested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents), the Grantee's Successor shall be entitled to any payments to which the
Grantee would have been entitled under these Terms with respect to such vested and unpaid RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents).
. If the Grantee ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries due to the Grantee's Early Retirement and such Early Retirement occurs more than six months after the Grant Date, the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall vest on a prorated basis. Such prorating of RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) shall be determined based on the number of days the Grantee was employed by the Company or a subsidiary in the period commencing with the Grant Date through and including the date on which the Grantee is last employed by the Company or a subsidiary, over the number of calendar days in the period commencing with the Grant Date through and including the third anniversary of the Grant Date. Any remaining unvested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents), after giving effect to the foregoing acceleration of vesting, shall terminate immediately upon the Grantee's Early Retirement. If the Grantee ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries due to the Grantee's Normal Retirement and such Normal Retirement occurs more than six months after the Grant Date, the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall vest in full.
2.7
Termination of Employment Due to Retirement
Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) vesting under this Section shall be paid in the calendar year containing the 75
th
day (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day) following the Grantee's Separation from Service. However, in the case of a Governmental Service Retirement by the Grantee, payment of the vested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) will be made within 10 days after the Grantee's Early or Normal Retirement. If the Grantee is a "specified employee" within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) as of the date of the Grantee's Separation from Service, the Grantee shall not be entitled to payment of his or her vested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) pursuant to this Section until the earlier of (and payment shall be made upon or promptly after, and in all events within thirty (30) days after, the first to occur of) (a) the date which is six (6) months and one day after the Grantee's Separation from Service, or (b) the date of the Grantee's death. The provisions of the preceding sentence shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.
In determining the Grantee's eligibility for Early or Normal Retirement, service is measured by dividing (a) the number of days the Grantee was employed by the Company or a subsidiary in the period commencing with
 
 
his or her last date of hire by the Company or a subsidiary through and including the date on which the Grantee is last employed by the Company or a subsidiary, by (b) 365. If the Grantee ceased to be employed by the Company or a subsidiary and was later rehired by the Company or a subsidiary, the Grantee's service prior to the break in service shall be disregarded in determining service for such purposes; provided that, if the Grantee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary had terminated due to the Grantee's Early Retirement, Normal Retirement, or by the Company or a subsidiary as part of a reduction in force (in each case, other than a termination by the Company or a subsidiary for cause) and, within the two-year period following such termination of employment (the "break in service") the Grantee was subsequently rehired by the Company or a subsidiary, then the Grantee's period of service with the Company or a subsidiary prior to and ending with the break in service will be included in determining service for such purposes. In the event the Grantee is employed by a business that is acquired by the Company or a subsidiary, the Company shall have discretion to determine whether the Grantee's service prior to the acquisition will be included in determining service for such purposes.
 
. The award, as well as the RSRs subject to the award, are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge. The foregoing transfer restrictions shall not apply to transfers to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may honor any transfer required pursuant to the terms of a court order in a divorce or similar domestic relations matter to the extent that such transfer does not adversely affect the Company's ability to register the offer and sale of the underlying shares on a Form S-8 Registration Statement and such transfer is otherwise in compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory and listing requirements.
3.1
Non-Transferability
. Any payments or issuances of shares with respect to the award are subject to recoupment pursuant to the Company's Policy Regarding the Recoupment of Certain Performance-Based Compensation Payments as in effect from time to time, as well as any recoupment or similar provisions of applicable law, and the Grantee shall promptly make any reimbursement requested by the Board or Committee pursuant to such policy or applicable law with respect to the award. Further, the Grantee agrees, by accepting the award, that the Company and its affiliates may deduct from any amounts it may owe the Grantee from time to time (such as wages or other compensation) to the extent of any amounts the Grantee is required to reimburse the Company pursuant to such policy or applicable law with respect to the award.
3.2
Recoupment of Awards
The Company's obligation to make any payments or issue any shares with respect to the award is subject to full compliance with all then applicable requirements of law, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company and its shares, and of any exchange upon which stock of the Company may be listed. The Grantee shall not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder, including without limitation the right to vote or receive dividends (except as expressly provided in these Terms with respect to Dividend Equivalents), with respect to any shares which may be issued in respect of the RSRs until the date appearing on the certificate(s) for such shares (or, in the case of shares entered in book entry form, the date that the shares are actually recorded in such form for the benefit of the Grantee), if such shares become deliverable.
 
. The RSRs, Dividend Equivalents, and the shares subject to the award are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of events such as stock splits, stock dividends and other changes in capitalization in accordance with Section 6(a) of the Plan.
5.1
Adjustments
. Notwithstanding the the provisions of Section 2 hereof, and further subject to the Company's ability to terminate the award as provided in Section 5.3 below, the outstanding and previously unvested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall become fully vested as of the date of the Grantee's termination of employment if the termination occurs either within the Protected Period corresponding to a Change in Control of the Company or within twenty-four (24) calendar months following the date of a Change in Control of the Company, the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated by the Company and its subsidiaries for reasons other than Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason.
5.2
Possible Acceleration on Change in Control
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the termination of the Grantee's employment (or other events giving rise to Good Reason) shall not entitle the Grantee to any accelerated vesting pursuant to this Section 5.2 if there is objective evidence that, as of the commencement of the Protected Period, the Grantee had specifically been identified by the Company as an employee whose employment would be terminated as part of a corporate restructuring or downsizing program that commenced prior to the Protected Period and such termination of employment was expected at that time to occur within six (6) months.
 
 
Payment of any RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) that vest under this Section will be made at the time provided for in Section 2.7 as though the termination of the Grantee's employment was due to a Normal Retirement.
. If the Company undergoes a Change in Control triggered by clause (iii) or (iv) of the definition thereof and the Company is not the surviving entity and the successor to the Company (if any) (or a Parent thereof) does not agree in writing prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control to continue and assume the award following the Change in Control, or if for any other reason the award would not continue after the Change in Control, then upon the Change in Control the outstanding and previously unvested RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall vest fully and completely. Unless the Committee expressly provides otherwise in the circumstances, no acceleration of vesting of the award shall occur pursuant to this Section 5.3 in connection with a Change in Control if either (a) the Company is the surviving entity, or (b) the successor to the Company (if any) (or a Parent thereof) agrees in writing prior to the Change in Control to assume the award. The Committee may make adjustments pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Plan and/or deem an acceleration of vesting of the award pursuant to this Section 5.3 to occur sufficiently prior to an event if necessary or deemed appropriate to permit the Grantee to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the shares underlying the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents); provided, however, that, the Committee may reinstate the original terms of the award if the related event does not actually occur.
5.3
Automatic Acceleration; Early Termination
Payment of any RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) that vest under this Section 5.3 will be made within 90 days of the third anniversary of the Grant Date unless, prior to such date: (i) the Grantee dies or has a Disability, in which case such payment will be made in the calendar year containing the 75
th
day following the date of the Grantee's death or Disability, as the case may be (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day), or (ii) the Grantee has a Separation from Service, in which case such payment will be made at the time provided for in Section 2.7 as though the termination of the Grantee's employment was due to a Normal Retirement.
 
.The Company or the subsidiary which employs the Grantee shall be entitled to require, as a condition of making any payments or issuing any shares upon vesting of the RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents), that the Grantee or other person entitled to such shares or other payment pay the minimum sums required to be withheld by federal,state, local or other applicable tax law with respect to such vesting or payment. Alternatively, the Company or such
6.1
Tax Withholding
subsidiary, in its discretion, may make such provisions for the withholding of taxes as it deems appropriate (including, without limitation, withholding the taxes due from compensation otherwise payable to the Grantee or reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable with respect to the award (valued at their then Fair Market Value) by the amount necessary to satisfy such statutory minimum withholding obligations).
. The Company will pay all federal and state transfer taxes, if any, and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of shares in connection with the vesting of the RSRs.
6.2
Transfer Taxes
. The Committee shall administer and construe the award, and may amend the Terms of the award, in a manner designed to comply with the Code and to avoid adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A or otherwise.
6.3
Compliance with Code
. The right of the Grantee to receive payment under the award shall be an unsecured contractual claim against the Company. As such, neither the Grantee nor any Successor shall have any rights in or against any specific assets of the Company based on the award. Awards shall at all times be considered entirely unfunded for tax purposes.
6.4
Unfunded Arrangement
 
The Committee has the discretionary authority to determine any questions as to the date when the Grantee's employment terminated and the cause of such termination and to interpret any provision of these Terms, the Grant Letter, the Stock Plan System, the Plan, and any other applicable rules. Any action taken by, or inaction of, the Committee relating to or pursuant to these Terms, the Grant Letter, the Stock Plan System, the Plan, or any other applicable rules shall be within the absolute discretion of the Committee and shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
The RSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award are governed by, and the Grantee's rights are subject to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any other rules adopted by the Committee, as the foregoing may be amended from time to time. The Grantee shall have no rights with respect to any amendment of these Terms or the Plan unless such amendment is in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Grant Letter and/or the Stock Plan System and the provisions of these Terms and/or the Plan, the provisions of these Terms and/or the Plan, as applicable, shall control.
 
 
The holding requirements of this Section 9 shall apply to any Grantee who is an elected or appointed officer of the Company on the date Vested RSRs are paid (or, if earlier, on the date the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminates for any reason). Any Grantee subject to this Section 9 shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, anticipate, alienate, assign, pledge, encumber or charge 50% of the total number (if any) of shares of Common Stock the Grantee receives as payment for Vested RSRs until the earlier of (A) the third anniversary of the date such shares of Common Stock are paid to the Grantee, (B) the date the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminates due to the Grantee's death or Disability, or (C) the occurrence of a Change in Control that results in termination and payment under Section 5.2 or 5.3 above. For purposes of this Section 9, the total number of shares of Common Stock the Grantee receives as payment for Vested RSRs shall be determined on a net basis after taking into account any shares otherwise deliverable with respect to the award that the Company withholds to satisfy tax obligations pursuant to Section 6.1. Any shares of Common Stock received in respect of shares that are covered by the holding period requirements of this Section 9 (such as shares received in respect of a stock split or stock dividend) shall be subject to the same holding period requirements as the shares to which they relate.
 
Whenever used in these Terms, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below and, when the meaning is intended, the initial letter of the word is capitalized:

Exhibit 10.2
These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") apply to certain "Restricted Performance Stock Rights" ("RPSRs") granted by Northrop Grumman Corporation (the "Company") in 2012 under its 2011 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan. If you were granted an RPSR award by the Company in 2012, the date of grant of your RPSR award and the target number of RPSRs applicable to your award are set forth in the letter from the Company announcing your RPSR award (your "Grant Letter") and are also reflected in the electronic stock plan award recordkeeping system ("Stock Plan System") maintained by the Company or its designee. These Terms apply only with respect to the 2012 RPSR award. If you were granted an RPSR award, you are referred to as the "Grantee" with respect to your award. Capitalized terms are generally defined in Section 10 below if not otherwise defined herein.
Each RPSR represents a right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, or cash of equivalent value as provided herein subject to vesting as provided herein. The performance period applicable to your award is January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 (the "Performance Period"). The target number of RPSRs subject to your award is subject to adjustment as provided herein. The RPSR award is subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, and is further subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, as it may be amended from time to time, and any rules adopted by the Committee, as such rules are in effect from time to time.
 
The RPSRs are subject to the vesting and payment provisions established by the Committee with respect to the Performance Period. RPSRs (and any Dividend Equivalents (as defined below)) that vest based on such provisions will be paid as provided below. No fractional shares will be issued.
. Subject to Sections 2 and 5 below, the RPSRs subject to the award shall vest and become nonforfeitable based on the performance methodology and goals established by the Committee for the Performance Period. At the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine whether and the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved. The percentage of target RPSRs subject to the award (if any) that have vested for the Performance Period (the "Earnout Percentage") shall be determined by the Committee based on the methodology and goals as established by the Committee, and its determination of the Earnout Percentage shall be conclusive and binding. Any RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award that are not vested as of the conclusion of the Performance Period after giving effect to the Committee's determinations under this Section 1.1 shall terminate and become null and void as of the last day of the Performance Period.
1.1
Performance-Based Vesting of RPSRs
. The number of RPSRs payable at the conclusion of the Performance Period ("Vested RPSRs") shall be determined by multiplying the Earnout Percentage by the target number of RPSRs subject to the award. The Vested RPSRs and any RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant
1.2
Payment of RPSRs
to Section 2 or 5 may be paid out in either an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock, or, in the discretion of the Committee, in cash or in a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash. In the event of a cash payment, the amount of payment for each Vested RPSR to be paid in cash will equal the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of a share of Common Stock as of the date the Committee determines the extent to which the applicable RPSR performance criteria have been achieved. Vested RPSRs will be paid in the calendar year following the calendar year containing the last day of the Performance Period (and generally will be paid in the first 75 days of such year).
. The Grantee shall be entitled to payment for Dividend Equivalents (if any) with respect to any Vested RPSRs and any RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant to Section 2 or 5. For purposes of these Terms, "Dividend Equivalents" means the aggregate amount of dividends paid by the Company on a number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the number of Vested RPSRs (or the number of RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant to Section 2 or 5) during the period from the beginning of the Performance Period until the date the Vested RPSRs (or the RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant to Section 2 or 5) are paid, without interest or other adjustments to reflect the time value of money. For these purposes, any Vested RPSRs or RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant to Section 2 or 5 in excess of the target number of RPSRs subject to the award shall be considered to have been granted at the beginning of the Performance Period. Dividend Equivalents (if any) will be paid at the same time as the Vested RPSRs (or the RPSRs that vest and become payable pursuant to Section 2 or 5) to which
1.3
Dividend Equivalents
 
 
they relate are paid. Dividend Equivalents will be paid in cash.
 
.The RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall terminate and become null and void prior to the conclusion of the Performance Period if and when (a) the award terminates in connection with a Change in Control pursuant to Section 5 below, or (b) except as provided below in this Section 2 and in Section 5, the Grantee ceases for any reason to be an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries.
2.1
General
. The number of RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall vest on a prorated basis as provided herein if the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminates due to the Grantee's Retirement, death, or Disability , in each case, only if the Grantee has completed at least six (6) consecutive calendar months of employment with the Company or a subsidiary during the three-year Performance Period. Such prorating of RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) shall be based on the number of full months the Grantee was actually employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries out of the 36 month Performance Period (the number of prorated RPSRs, the "Prorated RPSRs"). Partial months of employment during the Performance Period, even if substantial, shall not be counted for purposes of prorated vesting. Any RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award that do not vest in accordance with this Section 2.2 upon a termination of the Grantee's employment due to Retirement, death or Disability shall terminate immediately upon such termination of employment.
2.2
Termination of Employment Due to Retirement, Death or Disability
and
. In the case of death or Disability (a) the Earnout Percentage of the Grantee's Prorated RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) will be deemed to be 100% (target), regardless of actual performance, and (b) payment of the Prorated RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) that vest pursuant to this Section 2.2 will be made in the calendar year containing the 75
Death or Disability
th
day following the date of the Grantee's death or Disability (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day).
. Subject to the following provisions of this Section 2.2, in the case of Retirement, (a) the entire Performance Period will be used to calculate the Grantee's Vested RPSRs, (b) the Earnout Percentage of the Grantee's Prorated RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) will be determined based on actual performance for the Performance
Retirement in General
Period, and (c) payment of the Prorated RPSRs that become Vested RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) will be made in the calendar year following the calendar year containing the last day of the Performance Period (and generally will be paid in the first 75 days of such year).
In determining the Grantee's eligibility for Retirement, service is measured by dividing (a) the number of days the Grantee was employed by the Company or a subsidiary in the period commencing with his or her last date of hire by the Company or a subsidiary through and including the date on which the Grantee is last employed by the Company or a subsidiary, by (b) 365. If the Grantee ceased to be employed by the Company or a subsidiary and was later rehired by the Company or a subsidiary, the Grantee's service prior to the break in service shall be disregarded in determining service for such purposes; provided that, if the Grantee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary had terminated due to the Grantee's Retirement, or by the Company or a subsidiary as part of a reduction in force (in each case, other than a termination by the Company or a subsidiary for cause) and, within the two-year period following such termination of employment (the "break in service") the Grantee was subsequently rehired by the Company or a subsidiary, then the Grantee's period of service with the Company or a subsidiary prior to and ending with the break in service will be included in determining service for such purposes. In the event the Grantee is employed by a business that is acquired by the Company or a subsidiary, the Company shall have discretion to determine whether the Grantee's service prior to the acquisition will be included in determining service for such purposes.
In the case of a Governmental Service Retirement by the Grantee (a) the Performance Period used to calculate the Grantee's Vested RPSRs will be deemed to have ended as of the most recent date that performance has been measured by the Company with respect to the RPSRs prior to the Grantee's Retirement (but in no event shall such date be more than one year before the Grantee's Retirement), (b) the Earnout Percentage of the Grantee's Prorated RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) will be determined based on actual performance for that short Performance Period, and (c) payment of the Prorated RPSRs that become Vested RPSRs (and Dividend Equivalents thereon) will be made within 10 days after Retirement.
Retirement Due to Government Service.
.Subject to Section 5.2, all RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award shall terminate immediately upon a termination of the Grantee's employment: (a) for any reason other than due to the Grantee's Retirement, death or Disability; or (b) for Retirement, death or Disability, if the six-month
2.3
Other Terminations of Employment
 
 
employment requirement under Section 2.2 above is not satisfied.
. Unless the Committee otherwise provides (at the time of the leave or otherwise), if the Grantee is granted a leave of absence by the Company, the Grantee (a) shall not be deemed to have incurred a termination of employment at the time such leave commences for purposes of the award, and (b) shall be deemed to be employed by the Company for the duration of such approved leave of absence for purposes of the award. A termination of employment shall be deemed to have occurred if the Grantee does not timely return to active employment upon the expiration of such approved leave or if the Grantee commences a leave that is not approved by the Company.
2.4
Leave of Absence
. Subject to Section 2.4 above, the term "employment" as used herein means active employment by the Company and salary continuation without active employment (other than a leave of absence approved by the Company that is covered by Section 2.4) will not, in and of itself, constitute "employment" for purposes hereof (in the case of salary continuation without active employment, the Grantee's cessation of active employee status shall, subject to Section 2.4, be deemed to be a termination of "employment" for purposes hereof). Furthermore, salary continuation will not, in and of itself, constitute a leave of absence approved by the Company for purposes of the award.
2.5
Salary Continuation
. For purposes of the RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award, a termination of employment of the Grantee shall be deemed to have occurred if the Grantee is employed by a subsidiary or business unit and that subsidiary or business unit is sold, spun off, or otherwise divested, the Grantee does not otherwise continue to be employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries after such event, and the divested entity or business (or its successor or a parent company) does not assume the award in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a termination of employment, the termination shall be deemed to be a Retirement treated as provided for in Section 2.2 (subject to Section 5).
2.6
Sale or Spinoff of Subsidiary or Business Unit
. Except as expressly provided in Section 2.2, Section 2.4 and in Section 5, the vesting of the RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award requires continued employment through the last day of the Performance Period as a condition to the vesting of any portion of the award. Employment for only a portion of the Performance Period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Grantee to any proportionate vesting or avoid or mitigate a termination of rights and benefits upon or following a termination of employment. Nothing contained in these Terms, the Grant Letter, the Stock Plan System, or the
2.7
Continuance of Employment Required
Plan constitutes an employment commitment by the Company or any subsidiary, affects the Grantee's status (if the Grantee is otherwise an at-will employee) as an employee at will who is subject to termination without cause, confers upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any subsidiary, or interferes in any way with the right of the Company or of any subsidiary to terminate such employment at any time.
. In the event of the Grantee's death subsequent to the vesting of RPSRs but prior to the delivery of shares or other payment with respect to such RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents), the Grantee's Successor shall be entitled to any payments to which the Grantee would have been entitled under these Terms with respect to such RPSRs.
2.8
Death
 
. The award, as well as the RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award, are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge. The foregoing transfer restrictions shall not apply to transfers to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may honor any transfer required pursuant to the terms of a court order in a divorce or similar domestic relations matter to the extent that such transfer does not adversely affect the Company's ability to register the offer and sale of the underlying shares on a Form S-8 Registration Statement and such transfer is otherwise in compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory and listing requirements.
3.1
Non-Transferability
. Any payments or issuances of shares with respect to the award are subject to recoupment pursuant to the Company's Policy Regarding the Recoupment of Certain Performance-Based Compensation Payments as in effect from time to time as well as any recoupment or similar provisions of applicable law, and the Grantee shall promptly make any reimbursement requested by the Board or Committee pursuant to such policy or applicable law with respect to the award. Further, the Grantee agrees, by accepting the award, that the Company and its affiliates may deduct from any amounts it may owe the Grantee from time to time (such as wages or other compensation) to the extent of any amounts the Grantee is required to reimburse the Company pursuant to such policy or applicable law with respect to the award.
3.2
Recoupment of Awards
 
The Company's obligation to make any payments or issue any shares with respect to the award is subject to
 
 
full compliance with all then applicable requirements of law, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company and its shares, and of any exchange upon which stock of the Company may be listed. The Grantee shall not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder, including without limitation the right to vote or receive dividends (except as expressly provided in these Terms with respect to Dividend Equivalents), with respect to any shares which may be issued in respect of the RPSRs until the date appearing on the certificate(s) for such shares (or, in the case of shares entered in book entry form, the date that the shares are actually recorded in such form for the benefit of the Grantee), if such shares become deliverable.
 
. The RPSRs and the shares subject to the award are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of events such as stock splits, stock dividends and other changes in capitalization in accordance with Section 6(a) of the Plan. In addition, for RPSRs that do not use a relative total shareholder return metric as the applicable performance criterion, the applicable performance criteria and goals are subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan. Any such adjustment or determination not to make any adjustment shall be conclusive and binding.
5.1
Adjustments
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 hereof, and further subject to the Company's ability to terminate the award as provided in Section 5.3 below, the Grantee shall be entitled to vesting of the award as provided below in the event of the Grantee's termination of employment if at the time of the termination, the termination occurs either within the Protected Period corresponding to a Change in Control of the Company or within twenty-four (24) calendar months following the date of a Change in Control of the Company, and the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated by the Company and its subsidiaries for reasons other than Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason.
5.2
Possible Acceleration on Change in Control
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the termination of the Grantee's employment (or other events giving rise to Good Reason) shall not entitle the Grantee to any accelerated vesting pursuant to this Section 5.2 if there is objective evidence that, as of the commencement of the Protected Period, the Grantee had specifically been identified by the Company as an employee whose employment would be terminated as part of a corporate restructuring or downsizing program that commenced prior to the Protected Period and such termination of employment was expected at that time to occur within six (6) months.
In the event the Grantee is entitled to payment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, then the Grantee will be eligible for payment of a number of RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) determined in accordance with the following formula: (a) the Earnout Percentage determined in accordance with Section 1 but calculated based on performance for the portion of the three-year Performance Period ending on the last day of the month coinciding with or immediately preceding the date of the termination of the Grantee's employment, multiplied by (b) the target number of RPSRs subject to the award. Payment of any amount due under this Section 5.2 will be made in the calendar year following the calendar year containing the last day of the Performance Period (and generally will be paid in the first 75 days of such year) unless: (i) the Grantee dies or has a Disability, in which case such payment will be made in the calendar year containing the 75
th
day following the date of the Grantee's death or Disability, as the case may be (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day), or (ii) a Governmental Service Retirement by the Grantee, in which case payment will be made within 10 days after Retirement. In the event the Grantee is entitled to payment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, then this Section 5.2 shall control as to the amount and timing of the payment of the award notwithstanding anything in Section 2.2 to the contrary.
. If the Company undergoes a Change in Control triggered by clause (iii) or (iv) of the definition thereof and the Company is not the surviving entity and the successor to the Company (if any) (or a Parent thereof) does not agree in writing prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control to continue and assume the award following the Change in Control, or if for any other reason the award would not continue after the Change in Control, then upon the Change in Control the Grantee shall be entitled to a payment of the RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) as provided below and the award shall terminate. Unless the Committee expressly provides otherwise in the circumstances, no acceleration of vesting of the award shall occur pursuant to this Section 5.3 in connection with a Change in Control if either (a) the Company is the surviving entity, or (b) the successor to the Company (if any) (or a Parent thereof) agrees in writing prior to the Change in Control to assume the award. The Committee may make adjustments pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Plan and/or deem an acceleration of vesting of the award pursuant to this Section 5.3 to occur sufficiently prior to an event if necessary or deemed appropriate to permit the Grantee to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the shares underlying the award; provided, however, that, the Committee may reinstate the original terms of the award if the related event does not actually occur.
5.3
Automatic Acceleration; Early Termination
 
 
In the event the Grantee is entitled to a payment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3, then the Grantee will be eligible for payment of a number of RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) determined in accordance with the following formula: (a) the Earnout Percentage determined in accordance with Section 1 but calculated based on performance for the portion of the three-year Performance Period ending on the date of the Change in Control of the Company, multiplied by (b) the target number of RPSRs subject to the award. Payment of any amount due under this Section 5.3 will be made in the calendar year following the calendar year containing the last day of the Performance Period (and generally will be paid in the first 75 days of such year) unless: (i) the Grantee dies or has a Disability, in which case such payment will be made in the calendar year containing the 75
th
day following the date of the Grantee's death or Disability, as the case may be (and generally will be paid on or about such 75
th
day), or (ii) a Governmental Service Retirement by the Grantee, in which case payment will be made within 10 days after Retirement. In the event the Grantee is employed by the Company or a subsidiary immediately prior to the Change in Control and is entitled to payment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3, then this Section 5.3 shall control as to the amount and timing of the payment of the award notwithstanding anything in Section 2.2 or 5.2 to the contrary. In the event of the Grantee's Retirement pursuant to Section 2.2 prior to a Change in Control described in the first paragraph of this Section 5.3 in which the award is to be terminated, the Earnout Percentage shall no longer be based on the portion of the Performance Period otherwise considered for purposes of Section 2.2 but shall instead be calculated based on performance for the portion of the three-year Performance Period ending on the date of the Change in Control of the Company.
 
.The Company or the subsidiary which employs the Grantee shall be entitled to require, as a condition of making any payments or issuing any shares upon vesting of the RPSRs and related Dividend Equivalents, that the Grantee or other person entitled to such shares or other payment pay the minimum sums required to be withheld by federal, state, local or other applicable tax law with respect to such vesting or payment. Alternatively, the Company or such subsidiary, in its discretion, may make such provisions for the withholding of taxes as it deems appropriate (including, without limitation, withholding the taxes due from compensation otherwise payable to the Grantee or reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable with respect to the award (valued at their then Fair Market Value) by the amount necessary to satisfy such statutory minimum withholding obligations).
6.1
Tax Withholding
. The Company will pay all federal and state transfer taxes, if any, and other fees and expenses in
6.2
Transfer Taxes
connection with the issuance of shares in connection with the vesting of the RPSRs.
. The Committee shall administer and construe the award, and may amend the Terms of the award, in a manner designed to comply with the Code and to avoid adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A or otherwise.
6.3
Compliance with Code
. The right of the Grantee to receive payment under the award shall be an unsecured contractual claim against the Company. As such, neither the Grantee nor any Successor shall have any rights in or against any specific assets of the Company based on the award. Awards shall at all times be considered entirely unfunded for tax purposes.
6.4
Unfunded Arrangement
 
The Committee has the discretionary authority to determine any questions as to the date when the Grantee's employment terminated and the cause of such termination and to interpret any provision of these Terms, the Grant Letter, the Stock Plan System, the Plan, and any other applicable rules. Any action taken by, or inaction of, the Committee relating to or pursuant to these Terms, the Grant Letter, the Stock Plan System, the Plan, or any other applicable rules shall be within the absolute discretion of the Committee and shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
 
The RPSRs (and related Dividend Equivalents) subject to the award are governed by, and the Grantee's rights are subject to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any other rules adopted by the Committee, as the foregoing may be amended from time to time. The Grantee shall have no rights with respect to any amendment of these Terms or the Plan unless such amendment is in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the Grant Letter and/or the Stock Plan System and the provisions of these Terms and/or the Plan, the provisions of these Terms and/or the Plan, as applicable, shall control.
 
The holding requirements of this Section 9 shall apply to any Grantee who is an elected or appointed officer of the Company on the date any RPSRs are paid (or, if earlier, on the date the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminates for any reason). Any Grantee subject to this Section 9 shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, anticipate, alienate, assign, pledge, encumber or charge 50% of the total number (if
 
 
any) of shares of Common Stock the Grantee receives as payment for the RPSRs until the earlier of (A) the third anniversary of the date such shares of Common Stock are paid to the Grantee, (B) the date the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminates due to the Grantee's death or Disability, or (C) the occurrence of a Change in Control that results in termination and payment under Section 5.2 or 5.3 above. Should the Grantee's employment by the Company and its subsidiaries terminate (regardless of the reason for such termination, but other than due to the Grantee's death or Disability or a Change in Control related termination under Section 5.2), such holding period requirement shall not apply as to any shares acquired upon payment of RPSRs to the extent such payment is made more than one year after such termination of employment. (For purposes of clarity, in such circumstances the holding period requirement will apply as to any shares acquired upon payment of RPSRs within one year after such a termination of employment.) For purposes of this Section 9, the total number of shares of Common Stock the Grantee receives as payment for RPSRs shall be determined on a net basis after taking into account any shares otherwise deliverable with respect to the award that the Company withholds to satisfy tax obligations pursuant to Section 6.1. Any shares of Common Stock received in respect of shares that are covered by the holding period requirements of this Section 9 (such as shares received in respect of a stock split or stock dividend) shall be subject to the same holding period requirements as the shares to which they relate.
