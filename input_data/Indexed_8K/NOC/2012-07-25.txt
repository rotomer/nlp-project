Northrop Grumman Reports Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
FALLS CHURCH, Va.  July 25, 2012  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported second quarter 2012 earnings from continuing operations of
$480 million
, or
$1.88
per diluted share, compared with
$520 million
, or
$1.81
per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011. On a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 13 percent to
$1.79
from
$1.59
. During the quarter the company repurchased 4.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $295 million; $1.1 billion remains on its current share repurchase authorization.
Our businesses continue to perform well, and we continue to create value through a combination of performance and effective cash deployment. We're especially pleased with this quarter's robust level of new business capture, the increase in total backlog, and our strong cash generation. Based on the strength of our year-to-date results, we are again increasing our earnings guidance to a range of $7.05 to $7.25 per share, said Wes Bush, chairman, chief executive officer and president.

Second quarter 2012 operating income
decreased
$67 million
, or
8 percent
, and operating margin rate totaled
12.3 percent
. The change over the prior year period is principally due to a $64 million decrease in net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. On a pension-adjusted basis, operating income was comparable to the prior year period, and pension-adjusted operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to
11.8 percent
from
11.3 percent

Table 2  Cash Flow Highlights

$412 million
on an after-tax basis. Through
June 30, 2012
, trade working capital improved by $256 million from the prior year period. Free cash flow from continuing operations through
June 30, 2012

Aerospace Systems
Aerospace Systems second quarter 2012 sales declined
3 percent
due to lower volume for space systems and military aircraft programs, which more than offset higher volume for advanced programs and technology and unmanned systems programs, including Fire Scout and NATO AGS. Space systems sales declined due to lower volume for restricted programs and the termination of a weather satellite program.
Military aircraft sales declined due to lower program volume for the B-2 and the F-35 (due to the adoption of units-of-delivery revenue recognition beginning with low rate initial production lot 5) and fewer F/A-18 deliveries than in the prior year period. Lower volume for these military aircraft programs more than offset higher volume for the E-2D program.
Aerospace Systems second quarter 2012 operating income declined
9 percent
and operating margin rate declined to
12.1 percent
from
12.9 percent
. The change in operating income and margin rate reflects lower volume and the F/A-18 program's transition from the multi-year 2 contract to the lower margin multi-year 3 contract, as well as a favorable adjustment in the prior year period for the restructuring of a weather satellite program.
Electronic Systems
Electronic Systems second quarter 2012 sales declined
3 percent
, which reflects the company's previously announced decision to de-emphasize its domestic postal automation business. Sales were also impacted by lower volume for international postal automation and laser systems, and infrared countermeasures program transitions. Declines in these programs were partially offset by higher volume for space systems programs.
Electronic Systems second quarter 2012 operating income declined
3 percent
, consistent with lower volume, with operating margin rate comparable to the prior year period at
15.8 percent
.

Information Systems
Information Systems second quarter 2012 sales declined
9 percent
due to lower volume in all three business areas. Lower defense systems volume primarily reflects the termination of the Joint Tactical Radio System Airborne, Maritime and Fixed (JTRS AMF) program and lower volume for the F-22 as that program winds down. Civil systems volume was reduced by the sale of the County of San Diego IT outsourcing contract, which contributed sales of $21 million in the 2011 second quarter. For intelligence systems, lower volume primarily due to program completions impacted sales for the quarter.
Despite lower sales, Information Systems second quarter 2012 operating income increased
7 percent
and operating margin rate increased to
10.9 percent
from
9.3 percent
. Higher operating income and margin rate primarily reflect improved civil systems performance, which more than offset the impact of lower volume.
Technical Services
Technical Services second quarter 2012 sales increased
1 percent
due to higher volume for integrated logistics and modernization programs. Higher volume for these programs more than offset lower volume for defense and government services programs that resulted from portfolio shaping and lower volume on the ICBM program.
Technical Services second quarter 2012 operating income increased
19 percent
, and operating margin rate increased to
9.5 percent
from
8.0 percent
, due to risk mitigation on a defense and government services program for the Department of Homeland Security.

While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Definitions are provided for the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release. References to a Table in the definitions below relate to tables in the body of this press release. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.
Pension-adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations:
Diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding the after-tax net pension adjustment per share, as defined below. These per share amounts are provided for consistency and comparability of operating results.

Cash provided by (used in) continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions:
Cash provided by continuing operations before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Cash provided by continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions has been provided for consistency and comparability of 2012 and 2011 financial performance and is reconciled in Table 2.
Free cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations:
Cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures (including outsourcing contract & related software costs). We use free cash flow from continuing operations as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow from continuing operations is reconciled in Table 2.
