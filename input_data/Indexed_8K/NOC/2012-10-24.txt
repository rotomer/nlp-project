Northrop Grumman Reports Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results
FALLS CHURCH, Va.  Oct. 24, 2012  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported third quarter 2012 earnings from continuing operations of
$459 million
, or
$1.82
per diluted share, compared with
$520 million
, or
$1.86
per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011. The change in earnings and earnings per share is largely due to a $66 million decrease in net pension income in the 2012 third quarter. On a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 6 percent to
$1.73
from
$1.63
. During the third quarter the company repurchased 4.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $290 million. Year to date through Sept. 30, 2012, the company has repurchased 13.6 million shares of its common stock, and $2.0 billion remains on its current share repurchase authorization.
Our focus on performance, effective cash deployment, and portfolio alignment continues to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees. We are working closely with our customers to bring innovative, affordable solutions to support their needs in today's fiscally constrained environment, said Wes Bush, chairman, chief executive officer and president.

$89 million
, or
11 percent
, and operating margin rate was

compared with
12.5 percent
in the prior year period. The change in both operating income and operating margin rate is principally due to a $66 million decrease in net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in the 2012 third quarter. On a pension-adjusted basis, operating income was
$702 million
, and pension-adjusted operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to
11.2 percent
from
11.0 percent
.

, or
$1.82
per diluted share, compared with

, or
$1.86
per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share are based on

Table 2  Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash provided by continuing operations through Sept. 30, 2012, increased to
$1.6 billion
from
$1.0 billion
in the prior year, due to lower discretionary pension funding and working capital requirements than in the prior year period. In the third quarter of 2012 the company made a $300 million discretionary contribution to its pension plans that impacted cash flows through Sept. 30, 2012, by
$221 million
on an after-tax basis, compared with a discretionary contribution of $500 million in 2011 that impacted cash flows by
$367 million
on an after-tax basis. Free cash flow from continuing operations through Sept. 30, 2012, totaled
$1.4 billion
compared with
$700 million
in the prior year due to the cash trends mentioned above and lower capital spending than in the prior year period.
Before the impact of discretionary pension plan contributions, cash provided by continuing operations totaled
$1.0 billion
for the 2012 third quarter and
$1.8 billion
for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2012, and free cash flow totaled
$969 million
for the 2012 third quarter and
$1.6 billion
for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2012.
Changes in cash and cash equivalents described in Schedule 3 of this press release include the following items for cash from operations, investing and financing through Sept. 30, 2012:

Aerospace Systems
Aerospace Systems third quarter 2012 sales increased
5 percent
due to higher volume for unmanned systems, including NATO AGS and Fire Scout, and military aircraft programs, principally the F-35. Higher volume for these areas was partially offset by lower volume for restricted programs and the termination of a weather satellite program in space systems.
Aerospace Systems third quarter 2012 operating income declined
2 percent
and operating margin rate declined to
11.1 percent
from
12 percent
. The change in operating income and margin rate is principally due to the F/A-18 program's transition from the multiyear 2 contract to the lower margin multiyear 3 contract.
Electronic Systems
Electronic Systems third quarter 2012 sales declined
10 percent
, which reflects lower volume for combat avionics and postal automation programs, including the de-emphasis of the company's domestic postal automation business. Volume for infrared countermeasures and laser systems programs also declined due to force reductions in overseas contingency operations. Declines in these programs were partially offset by higher volume for space systems programs.
Electronic Systems third quarter 2012 operating income declined
5 percent
, and operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to
16.3 percent
. Lower operating income is due to lower volume and higher margin rate reflects improved program performance. Third quarter 2011 operating income included a provision for a dispute on a domestic postal automation program.

Information Systems
Information Systems third quarter 2012 sales declined
9 percent
due to lower volume for defense and intelligence systems programs. Lower volume for defense systems primarily reflects the termination of the Joint Tactical Radio System Airborne, Maritime and Fixed (JTRS AMF) program, as well as lower volume across several other programs. Lower intelligence systems sales are primarily due to lower volume for several restricted programs.
Information Systems third quarter 2012 operating income decreased
9 percent
, consistent with the decline in volume, and operating margin rate of
9.6 percent
was consistent with the prior year period.
Technical Services
Technical Services third quarter 2012 sales decreased
6 percent
due to lower volume for logistics and modernization programs, principally the KC-10 program, as well as portfolio shaping actions for defense and government services programs.
Technical Services third quarter 2012 operating income decreased
2 percent
, and operating margin rate increased to
8.3 percent
from
7.9 percent
.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure:
Todays press release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Definitions are provided for the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release. References to a Table in the definitions below relate to tables in the body of this press release. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.
Pension-adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations:
Diluted EPS from continuing operations excluding the after-tax net pension adjustment per share, as defined below. These per share amounts are provided for consistency and comparability of operating results. Management uses pension-adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, as reconciled in Table 1, as an internal measure of financial performance.
Cash provided by continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions:
Cash provided by continuing operations before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Cash provided by continuing operations before discretionary pension contributions has been provided for consistency and comparability of 2012 and 2011 financial performance and is reconciled in Table 2.
Free cash flow provided by continuing operations:
Cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures (including outsourcing contract & related software costs). We use free cash flow from continuing operations as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow from continuing operations is reconciled in Table 2.
