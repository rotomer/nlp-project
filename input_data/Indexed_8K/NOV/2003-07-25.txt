EXHIBIT 99.1 [NATIONAL OILWELL LOGO] NEWS CONTACT: STEVE KRABLIN (713) 346-7773 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NATIONAL OILWELL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS HOUSTON, TX, July 25, 2003--National-Oilwell, Inc. (NYSE: NOI) reported net income of $20.4 million ($0.24 per diluted share) for its second quarter ended June 30, 2003. Consolidated revenues were down sequentially from the first quarter by $25 million, primarily due to lower capital equipment revenues. Consolidated operating income as a percent of revenues was essentially flat in the second quarter compared to the first. Backlog of capital equipment at the end of the second quarter was $366 million, also essentially flat on a sequential basis. Revenues from capital equipment for the quarter totaled $155 million, and incoming orders declined to $153 million from $174 million in the prior quarter. The China Joint Venture is not included in backlog data. Capital spending was $7.8 million, consistent with the first quarter of the year and approximately 90% of the second quarter depreciation and amortization charge. PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP Product and Technology revenues declined due to the previously mentioned decline in capital equipment revenues. Increased revenues in downhole tools and pump expendables offset a portion of the decline. Operating income approximated 12% of revenues. - more -
PAGE 2 DISTRIBUTION SERVICES GROUP Distribution revenues increased by $5 million as strength in the United States and outside North America offset the seasonal slowdown in Canada. Operating income approximated 3% of revenues. Pete Miller, President and CEO of National Oilwell, stated "We are very pleased that net income in the second quarter improved sequentially and year over year. Based on the marketplace trends that we are seeing, we believe that we will achieve further improvement in net income during each of the next two quarters. "Many of our businesses benefit disproportionately from drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico which remained flat in the second quarter. We continue to see indications of improvement in this market that should translate into increased future revenues from this area. While capital equipment orders in the quarter were down sequentially, the likely sustainability of the order flow actually improved as, unlike the first quarter, there were no new large projects added to the backlog. We experienced broad demand for all types of equipment, with continued emphasis from the offshore and international land markets." The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss second quarter results. The call will be broadcast through the Investor Relations link on National Oilwell's web site at www.natoil.com, and a replay will be available on the site for seven days following the conference. Participants may also join the conference call by dialing 913-981-5530 (identification code: 211469) five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time.
