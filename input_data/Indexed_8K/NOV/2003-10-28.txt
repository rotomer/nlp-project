EXHIBIT 99.1 (NATIONAL OILWELL LOGO) NEWS CONTACT: STEVE KRABLIN (713) 346-7773 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NATIONAL OILWELL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS HOUSTON, TX, October 28, 2003--National-Oilwell, Inc. (NYSE: NOI) reported net income of $22.7 million ($0.27 per diluted share) for its third quarter ended September 30, 2003. Financial Results (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues and operating income compare favorably sequentially and to the prior year period. Contributing to these improvements are increased activity levels and the successful integration of acquisitions made at the beginning of the year. Backlog of capital equipment at the end of the third quarter was $340 million compared to $366 million at the end of the second quarter. Revenues from capital equipment for the quarter totaled $147 million, down 5% from the prior quarter, and incoming orders declined to $121 million from $153 million. Capital spending was $6.3 million, compared to $7.8 for the second quarter of the year and approximately 70% of the third quarter depreciation and amortization charge. PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP Products and Technology revenues and operating income increased by $7.2 and $4.0 million over the second quarter, led by improvements in downhole tools, drilling spares and pump expendables. Operating income approximated 13% of revenues, as favorable product mix led to strong incremental improvement for the quarter. - more -
PAGE 2 DISTRIBUTION SERVICES GROUP Improved land drilling activity throughout North America resulted in a $17.7 million revenue increase over the prior quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by product mix and higher operating costs. Operating margin approximated 2.3% of revenues compared to 2.9% in the second quarter. Pete Miller, President and CEO of National Oilwell, stated "Our non-capital business continues to improve steadily, and this contributed to our best quarterly results since 2001. While backlog and capital equipment orders can be affected by our customers' various timing issues, we continue to see strong global interest and the beginnings of the need for new capital equipment in North America." The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss third quarter results. The call will be broadcast through the Investor Relations link on National Oilwell's web site at www.natoil.com, and a replay will be available on the site for thirty days following the conference.
