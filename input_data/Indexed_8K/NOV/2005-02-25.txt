FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOUSTON, TX, February 25, 2005National-Oilwell, Inc. (NYSE: NOI) today reported fourth quarter revenues of $669.5 million and net income of $50.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. Full year 2004 revenues were $2.3 billion, and net income was $110.2 million, or $1.27 per share.
Included in fourth quarter and full year net income were tax benefits resulting primarily from the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that increased net income by approximately $15 million, or $0.17 per share.
Backlog of capital equipment orders increased to $605 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $575 million at September 30, 2004, and $339 at December 31, 2003.
Fourth quarter revenues for this group increased to $465.9 million, up 11% sequentially and 34% over the fourth quarter 2003.

Pete Miller, President and CEO of National Oilwell, stated "Our revenues and operating results showed continuing improvement and strength throughout 2004, and have set the stage for an even stronger performance in 2005. Our non capital businesses were responsible for much of our improvement this past year, and while we expect continued improvements from these, we believe 2005 will be heavily influenced by capital equipment orders. Our year end backlog of orders, especially from international markets, grew steadily last year, exceeding $600 million at year end. New order additions in 2004 were $961 million, and we believe 2005 will see new orders of capital equipment of at least $1.0  1.2 billion. Already in the first two months of 2005 we have received over $200 million in capital orders, also primarily from international customers."
