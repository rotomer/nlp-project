      On March 16, 2005, National Oilwell Varco, Inc. ("National Oilwell Varco") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report that the merger of National-Oilwell, Inc. and Varco International, Inc. had been approved by stockholders of each company by substantial margins. National Oilwell Varco is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K/A to amend only Item 9.01, as reported in such previous Current Report, to provide the financial statements and financial information required by Item 9.01(b) hereof. Except for the filing of the financial statements and financial information and related exhibits, the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 16, 2005 is not being amended or updated in any manner.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
      The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared assuming the merger of National Oilwell and Varco is accounted for as a purchase under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of each company which include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the results as of and for such periods. However, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give consideration to the impact, if any, of asset dispositions or cost savings that may result from the merger. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at December 31, 2004, and unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of National Oilwell and Varco and the related notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared as if the merger occurred as of, or at the beginning of, each period presented. There are no significant adjustments required to the historical financial data to conform the accounting policies of the two companies unless described herein.
      The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or financial position that would have occurred had the transaction been consummated at the beginning of the period presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results.
