The US Swingline Lender will promptly (but in any event prior to 3:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the date of such proposed US Swingline Advance make such US Swingline Advance available to the Borrower at the Borrower's account with the US Administrative Agent or such other accounts as may be designated by the Borrower.
          (iii) Except as provided in the following clause (iv) below, each request for a Canadian Swingline Advance shall be made pursuant to telephone notice to the Canadian Swingline Lender, together with a written notice to the US Administrative Agent, given no later than 12:00 p.m. (Calgary, Alberta time) on the date of the proposed Swingline Advance, promptly confirmed by a completed and executed Notice of Borrowing telecopied to the Canadian Swingline Lender and the US Administrative Agent.

However, if on the date such request is made, the Dollar Amount of the sum of the outstanding Primary Advances and the Primary Letter of Credit Exposure is greater than 50% of the aggregate Primary Commitments, then (A) promptly after receipt by the Canadian Swingline Lender of any
 
request for a Canadian Swingline Advance, the Canadian Swingline Lender will confirm with the US Administrative Agent that the US Administrative Agent has also received such request and, if not, the Canadian Swingline Lender will notify the US Administrative Agent of the contents thereof, and (B) unless the Canadian Swingline Lender has received notice in writing from the US Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. (Calgary, Alberta time) on the date of the proposed Canadian Swingline Advance directing the Canadian Swingline Lender not to make such Canadian Swingline Advance as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso of Section 2.1(c) above then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Canadian Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. (Calgary, Alberta time) on the borrowing date specified for such Canadian Swingline Advance, make the amount of such Canadian Swingline Advance available at the Borrower's account with the US Administrative Agent or such other accounts as may be designated by the Borrower.

The applicable Swingline Lender shall give the US Administrative Agent and each Primary Lender notice of such Mandatory Revolving Borrowing by 12:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the date the Mandatory Revolving Borrowing is to be made and including the Designated Currency. Each Primary Lender shall make its Primary Advance available to the US Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender in immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the date requested, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably instructs the applicable Swingline Lender to apply the proceeds of such Mandatory Revolving Borrowing to the payment of the outstanding Swingline Advances.
          (v) If for any reason any Swingline Advance cannot be refinanced by a Primary Borrowing in accordance with clause (ii) above, the request for the Primary Advances submitted by the applicable Swingline Lender as set forth therein shall be deemed to be a request by such Swingline Lender that each of the Primary Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Advances and each Primary Lender's payment to the US Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
          (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the US Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(c) by the time specified in this Section 2.1(c), such Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Primary Lender (acting through the US Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Primary Lender (through the US Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
          (vii) Each Primary Lender's obligation to make the Primary Advances or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Advances pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Primary Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, (C) whether or not the conditions precedent in Section 3.2 have been satisfied. (D) termination of the Primary Currency Commitments or acceleration of the Advances, and (E) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Advances, together with interest as provided herein.
          (viii) At any time after any Primary Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Advance, if the applicable Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Advance, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Primary Lender its Applicable Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Primary Lender's risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.
          (ix) Each Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Advances made by such Swingline Lender. Until each Primary Lender funds its Primary Prime Rate Advance, Eurocurrency Rate Advance or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) to refinance such Lender's Applicable Pro Rata Share of any Swingline Advance, interest in respect of such Applicable Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender.
          (x) The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the US Swingline Advances directly to the US Swingline Lender and all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Canadian Swingline Advances directly to the Canadian Swingline Lender.

market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Advance, the right of the Borrower to select Eurocurrency Rate Advances in the affected currency or currencies for such Borrowing or for any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended until the Norwegian Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Norwegian Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and upon receipt by the Borrower of the notice of such suspension, the Borrower may revoke the pending request or, failing that, each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be made as a Norwegian Prime Rate Advance in the NOK Amount of the originally requested Advance;

Notices Irrevocable
          (e) . Unless the applicable Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender before the date of any Revolving Borrowing or Mandatory Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the applicable Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agents may assume that such Lender has made its Applicable Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing available to the applicable Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.2 and the applicable Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made its Applicable Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing available to the applicable Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to immediately repay to the applicable Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest on such amount, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the applicable Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable on such day to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate for such day. If such Lender shall repay to the applicable Administrative Agent such corresponding amount and interest as provided above, such corresponding amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement even though not made on the same day as the other Advances comprising such Borrowing.
Administrative Agents Reliance
          (f) . The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.
Lender Obligations Several
          (g) .
Evidence of Obligations
          (i) The Advances and Letters of Credit made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the applicable Administrative Agent with respect to the applicable Facility in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agents and the applicable Lenders shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Advances and Letters of Credit made by such Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the applicable Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the applicable Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the applicable Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the applicable Administrative Agent) the applicable Note or Notes which shall evidence such Lender's Advances to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to such Notes and
 
endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.
          (ii) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (i) above, each Lender and each Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Advances. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the applicable Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the applicable Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
