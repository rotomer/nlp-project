Vesting of Restricted Stock
     (a) Subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, the shares of Restricted Stock shall become vested in full IF the Performance Criteria (as defined below) are satisfied during the Performance Period (as defined below).

For purposes of this Agreement, "employment with the Company" shall include being an employee or a director of, or a consultant to, the Company or any of its subsidiaries (a "Subsidiary").
     (h) The provisions of any written employment or severance agreement between you and the Company concerning the vesting of Restricted Stock are incorporated hereby and made a part of this
 
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of any such agreement and this Agreement or the Plan, the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Plan shall control.
     (i) All shares of Restricted Stock that are not vested on or before your termination of employment for any reason other than as provided in subparagraph (g) above shall, upon your termination, be automatically cancelled and forfeited without payment.

No physical certificates evidencing the Restricted Stock will be issued to you until the satisfaction of all vesting conditions set forth herein and the satisfaction of all applicable tax withholding obligations. You shall, if required by the Committee, deliver to the Company a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Stock.

     5. . These shares of Restricted Stock are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. Unless otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same defined meanings in this Agreement. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to your interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and you.
