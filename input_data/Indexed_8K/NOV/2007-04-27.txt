Reported revenues for the first quarter were $2,165.7 million, an increase of 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006 and an increase of 43 percent from the first quarter of 2006. Operating profit for the quarter was $427.1 million or 19.7 percent of sales. Operating profit flow-through, or the increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue, was 53 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2007, and was 35 percent from the first quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2007.

The increase in the Company's backlog for capital equipment reflected the strong demand for its drilling equipment products, particularly for offshore rigs.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We are off to a great start in 2007. The demand for our oilfield products and services remained strong during the quarter, and we believe that activity will continue to grow internationally. We expect demand for our drilling equipment, particularly for international offshore projects, to remain strong into 2007. Our record backlog for drilling equipment continues to provide us with unprecedented visibility. We remain optimistic about our opportunities for this year."
