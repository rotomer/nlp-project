Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007 it earned net income of $366.0 million, or $1.02 per fully diluted share, an increase of 15 percent compared to second quarter ended June 30, 2007 net income of $318.5 million, or $0.89 per fully diluted share. Earnings per share more than doubled from the third quarter of 2006, when the Company earned $176.6 million or $0.50 per fully diluted share.
HOUSTON, TX, October 24, 2007
Revenues for the third quarter of 2007 were $2,579.5 million, an increase of 8 percent from the second quarter of 2007 and an increase of 45 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Operating profit for the quarter was $545.4 million or 21.1 percent of sales. Operating profit flow-through, or the increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue, was 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2007, and was 32 percent from the third quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2007.
Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment at September 30, 2007 increased to $8.0 billion, compared to $7.2 billion at June 30, 2007. New orders during the quarter were a record $1.9 billion. The Company's backlog for capital equipment continued to increase as a result of strong demand for its drilling equipment, particularly for international offshore rigs.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We performed well in the third quarter, as orders for our capital drilling equipment remained strong. Efficient execution of our business, along with the continued strong demand for our oilfield products and services, are driving solid operating margins through each of our business segments. Our record backlog for drilling equipment is providing unprecedented visibility. International demand for our equipment and services continues to build, particularly from national oil companies, while North American operators appear to be adopting a more cautious stance as we enter the fourth quarter."
Rig Technology
Third quarter revenues for the Rig Technology segment were $1,521.9 million, an increase of 8 percent over the second quarter of 2007 and an increase of 72 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Operating profit for this segment was $373.5 million, or 24.5 percent of sales, an increase of 10 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Operating profit flow-through from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2007 was 29 percent, and operating profit flow-through
 
from the third quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2007 was 34 percent. Revenue out of backlog for the segment rose 20 percent sequentially and 94 percent year-over-year, to $1,152.4 million for the third quarter of 2007.
Petroleum Services & Supplies
Revenues for the third quarter of 2007 for the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment were $805.5 million, up 8 percent compared to second quarter 2007 results and up 29 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Operating profit was $193.6 million, or 24.0 percent of revenue, an increase of 9 percent from the second quarter. Operating profit flow-through from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2007 was 27 percent, and operating profit flow-through from the third quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2007 was 30 percent. Modest seasonal improvement in Canada during the quarter following breakup and continued high levels of oilfield production and drilling activity internationally contributed to this segment's strong performance.
Distribution Services
The Distribution Services segment generated third quarter revenues of $361.3 million, an increase of 5 percent from the second quarter of 2007 and an increase of 2 percent from the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter operating profit was $25.1 million or 6.9 percent of sales. This segment benefited from sequential seasonal sales improvements in Canada and growth in international markets. Operating profit flow-through from the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2007 was 12 percent.
