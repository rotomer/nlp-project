HOUSTON, TX, April 30, 2008
Reported revenues for the first quarter were $2,685.4 million, an increase of 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 and an increase of 24 percent from the first quarter of 2007. Operating profit for the quarter was $568.5 million or 21.2 percent of sales. Operating profit flow-through, or the increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue, was 27 percent from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008.
Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment at March 31, 2008 increased to $9.9 billion, compared to $9.0 billion at December 31, 2007, with new orders during the quarter of $2.0 billion. The increase in the Company's backlog for capital equipment reflected the strong demand for its drilling equipment products, particularly for offshore rigs.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We are off to a good start in 2008. Our record backlog for drilling equipment continues to provide us with unprecedented visibility. We expect demand for our drilling equipment, particularly for international offshore projects, to remain strong into 2008.
We are also excited about our recently completed merger with Grant Prideco. We believe this acquisition complements our existing offering of oilfield products and services and will benefit our customers' needs. We would like to welcome the Grant Prideco employees to the National Oilwell Varco organization."
