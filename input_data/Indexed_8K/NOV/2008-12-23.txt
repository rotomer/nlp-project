Whereas
          , as a result of the merger of National-Oilwell, Inc. and Varco International, Inc. on March 11, 2005, National-Oilwell L.P. and National-Oilwell, Inc. were reorganized in the forms of the Company and NOI, respectively, each of which succeeded to the obligations of its predecessor;
Whereas
          , the Original Agreement must be amended on or before December 31, 2008 to comply with new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by the America Jobs Protection Act of 2004; and
Whereas

Whereas
          , in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Now, Therefore
     (ii) Annual Bonus. The Executive shall be eligible for an annual bonus (the "Annual Bonus") for each fiscal year ending during the Employment Period on the same basis as other executive officers under the Company's then current Annual Incentive Plan (or such other name as may be adopted for the plan or its successor), which shall be payable in accordance with the terms of such plan.
 
          Any reimbursement of expenses required under this paragraph and any reimbursement of legal fees and expenses required under Section 6(c) of this Agreement shall be made by the Company upon or as soon as practicable following receipt of supporting documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Company (but in any event not later than the close of the Executive's taxable year following the taxable year in which the fee, disbursement, cost or expense is incurred by the Executive); provided, however, that, upon the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, in no event shall any additional reimbursement be made prior to the date that is six months after the date of the Executive's termination of employment to the extent such payment delay is required under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In no event shall any reimbursement be made to the Executive for such expenses and fees incurred after the later of (1) the tenth anniversary of the date of the Executive's death or (2) the date that is ten years after the date of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company.
For purposes of any payments or provision of benefits under this Agreement, the Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company unless the Executive incurs a "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder.
     (A) the sum of (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2), the product of () the higher of (I) the highest Annual Bonus received by the Executive over the preceding three year period and (II) the Annual Bonus paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year consisting of less than 12 full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than 12 full months), for the most recently completed fiscal year during the Employment Period, if any (such higher amount being referred to as the "Highest Annual Bonus") and () a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 365; and (3) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"), and
x
y
     (B) an amount equal to three times the sum of (i) the then current Annual Base Salary of the Executive and (ii) the Highest Annual Bonus, and
     (C) an amount equal to the maximum amount of employer matching contributions that could have been credited to the Executive under the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan (without regard to any applicable nondiscrimination tests), any other excess or supplemental retirement plan in which the Executive participates or any other deferred compensation plan during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the month of the Executive's Date of Termination multiplied by three, such amount to be grossed up so that the amount the Executive actually receives after payment of any federal or state taxes payable thereon equals the amount first described above.
 
(ii) Until the date of the Executive's death, the Company shall continue group health plan (as defined for purposes of Section 4980B of the Code) benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 2(b)(iv) of this Agreement as if the Executive's employment had not been terminated; provided, that if the Executive's participation after the Date of Termination in such group health plan is not permitted by the terms of a plan, then for the Executive's lifetime, the Company shall provide the Executive through other sources with substantially the same benefits that were provided to the Executive by that plan immediately before the Termination Date; provided further, that if the Executive becomes reemployed by another employer and is eligible to receive any of such benefits under another employer provided plan, the benefits provided hereunder shall be secondary to those provided under such other plans. With respect to any group health plan that requires an employee contribution, for the period of time during which the Executive would be entitled (or would, but for this Agreement, be entitled) to continuation coverage under a group health plan of the Company under Section 4980B of the Code if the Executive elected such coverage and paid the applicable premiums (generally, 18 months), the Executive shall pay the then active employee cost of the benefits as determined under the then current practices of the Company on a monthly, semi-annual or annual basis as elected by the Executive, and thereafter, the Executive shall pay the full cost of the benefits as determined under the then current practices of the Company on a monthly or annual basis as elected by the Executive, provided that the Company shall reimburse the Executive the amount of the costs of the benefit that is in excess of the then active employees costs for such benefits no later than 30 days following the end of the Executive's taxable year in which such reimbursable amounts are paid by the Executive, and provided further that the reimbursements provided, during the Executive's taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (with the exception of applicable lifetime maximums applicable to medical expenses or medical benefits described in Section 105(b) of the Code) and the right to reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit or payment;
     (iii) The Company shall reimburse Executive for all outplacement services incurred on and prior to the last day of the second calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurs up to a maximum direct cost to the Company of up to 15% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary as of the Date of Termination. Company shall reimburse Executive within 30 days after Executive provides the Company with an invoice (and any supporting documentation required by the Company) for such outplacement services, but in no event shall any such reimbursement be made after the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurs;
 
     (iv) With respect to all options to purchase Common Stock held by the Executive pursuant to an NOI stock option plan on or prior to the Date of Termination that were vested on or before December 31, 2004, irrespective of whether such options are then exercisable, the Executive shall have the right, during the sixty (60) day period after the Date of Termination, to elect to surrender all or part of such options in exchange for a cash payment by the Company to the Executive in an amount equal to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Executive's option multiplied by the difference between (x) and (y) where (x) equals the purchase price per share covered by the option and (y) equals the highest reported sale price of a share of Common Stock in any transaction reported on the New York Stock Exchange during the sixty (60) day period prior to and including the Executive's Date of Termination. Such cash payments shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date of the Executive's election; provided, however, that if the Executive's Date of Termination is within six months after the date of grant of a particular option held by the Executive and the Executive is subject to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any cash payments related thereto shall be made on the date which is six months and one day after the date of grant of such option to the extent necessary to prevent the imposition of the disgorgement provisions under Section 16(b).
     Any options outstanding as of the Date of Termination and not then exercisable shall become fully exercisable as of the Executive's Date of Termination, and to the extent the Executive does not elect to surrender any options that were vested on or before December 31, 2004 for a cash payment as provided above, such options shall remain exercisable for one year after the Executive's Date of Termination, until the stated expiration of the stated term thereof, or until the 10 anniversary of the original date of grant thereof, whichever is shorter; any restrictions imposed by NOI or the Company that are applicable to any shares of Common Stock granted to the Executive by NOI or the Company shall lapse, as of the date of the Executive's Date of Termination;
th
     (vi) Any compensation previously deferred by the Executive under a plan sponsored by the Company (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) shall be distributed at the earliest time permitted by such plan or, if permitted under the terms of such plan and all applicable laws, statutes or regulations governing such plans, at such other time as the Executive may elect under the terms of such plan;
     (vii) To the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies; provided, however that any amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided to the Executive under a plan that is intended to be a qualified plan as described under Section 401(a) of the Code shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such qualified plan (all such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits"); and
 
Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, if the Executive is determined by the Board (or its delegate) to be a "specified employee" (as described in Section 409A of the Code) for the year in which Executive's Date of Termination occurs, (1) any payments or in-kind benefits due hereunder that are not permitted to be paid or provided on the date(s) specified hereunder without the imposition of additional taxes, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid in a lump sum or provided on the first business day following the six-month anniversary of the Date of Termination or, if earlier, Executive's death (the "Section 409A Payment Date") and (2) any transfers of any memberships that are required under Section 4(a)(v) shall not be transferred until the Section 409A Payment Date, and for each month (or portion thereof) during such delay period, Executive shall be entitled to use such memberships and, to the extent Executive elects to use such, shall pay to the Company the fair market value of the usage; provided that on the Section 409A Payment Date, the Company shall reimburse Executive for the payments made to the Company for such usage during the delay period.
     (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, any additional payments due to Executive under this Section 7 shall be paid by the Company no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
     (g) This Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to meet those requirements and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that a payment, or the settlement or deferral thereof, is subject to Section 409A of the Code, except as the Board of Directors and Executive otherwise determine in writing, the payment shall be paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto, such that the payment, settlement or deferral shall not be subject to the additional tax or interest applicable under Section 409A of the Code. Any provision of this Agreement that would cause the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall be amended (in a manner that as closely as practicable achieves the original intent of this Agreement) to comply with Section 409A of the Code on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive basis, if permitted under the regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code. In the event additional regulations or other guidance is issued under Section 409A of the Code or a court of competent jurisdiction provides additional authority concerning the application of Section 409A with respect to the payments described hereunder, then the
 
provisions regarding such payments shall be amended to permit such payments to be made at the earliest time allowed under such additional regulations, guidance or authority that is practicable and achieves the original intent of this Agreement.

The Company promises to provide Executive secret and confidential information, knowledge and data during his employment. After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.
17.
Non-Competition.
A. As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to be paid to Executive hereunder, and the Company's promise to provide secret and confidential information, knowledge and data to Executive, and as an additional incentive for the Company to enter into this Agreement, the Company, and Executive agree to the non-competition provisions of this Section 17. Executive agrees that during the period of Executive's non-competition obligations hereunder, Executive will not, directly or indirectly for Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies are conducting any business as of the date of termination of the employment relationship or have during the previous twelve months conducted any business:
 
(i) engage in any business competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates;
(ii) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates;
(iii) induce any officer or manager of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such officer or manager by person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.
These non-competition obligations shall apply during Executive's employment and shall terminate on the first (1st) anniversary date following Executive's Date of Termination regardless of the basis for such termination, unless (as set forth in Section 5 herein), during the Protective Period, the Executive voluntarily terminates employment for Good Reason or the Company terminates Executive's employment other than for Cause, in which case the obligations herein shall terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary date following Executive's Date of Termination. After termination of Executive's employment these non-competition obligations shall apply only to businesses having annual revenues in excess of $20 million competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries having annual revenues in excess of $20 million for the last fiscal year prior to the time of termination. If the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates abandons a particular aspect of its business, that is, ceases such aspect of its business with the intention to permanently refrain from such aspect of its business, then this post-employment non-competition covenant shall not apply to such former aspect of that business.
B. Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit his ability to engage in certain businesses anywhere in the world during the period provided for above, but acknowledges that Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration, confidential and secret information, and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such restriction. Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 17 by Executive, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach after notification by the Company of any breach and Executive's failure to cure same. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Section 17, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from Executive and his agents involved in such breach.
C. The Executive and the Company each expressly acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this Agreement, including this Section 17, are deemed by each to be reasonable and necessary to protect the business interests of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. However, in the event that any of the restrictions contained in this Agreement, and specifically this Section 17, are found by a court of competent
 
jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, it is the parties express intention for the restrictions herein set forth to be modified by such court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by the court, to be fully enforced.

          (v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 9(c) of this Agreement, or
          (vi) notice by the Company to the Executive that the Company is not extending or renewing this Agreement.
 
     (d) Notice of Termination.

     (e) Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" shall mean:
          (i) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be;
          (ii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination; and
          (iii) if the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.
     For purposes of any payments or provision of benefits under this Agreement, the Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company unless the Executive incurs a "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder.

OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UPON TERMINATION.
     (a) Good Reason; Other than For Cause, Death or Disability. If, during the Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Cause, death or Disability, or the Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason:
          (i) The Company shall pay to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination the aggregate of the following amounts:
               (A) the sum of (1) the Executive's Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) the product of (x) the higher of (I) the highest Annual Bonus received by the Executive over the preceding three-year period and (II) the Annual Bonus paid or payable, including any bonus or portion thereof which has been earned but deferred (and annualized for any fiscal year consisting of less than 12 full months or during which the Executive was employed for less than 12 full months), for the most recently completed fiscal year during the Employment Period, if any (such higher amount being referred to as the "Highest Annual
 
Bonus") and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 365, and (3) any accrued vacation pay, to the extent not theretofore paid, (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"), and
               (B) an amount equal to the sum of (i) the then current Annual Base Salary of the Executive and (ii) the Highest Annual Bonus, and
               (C) an amount equal to the maximum amount of employer matching contributions that could have been credited to the Executive under the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan (without regard to any applicable nondiscrimination tests), any other excess or supplemental retirement plan in which the Executive participates or any other deferred compensation plan during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the month of the Executive's Date of Termination, such amount to be grossed up so that the amount the Executive actually receives after payment of any federal or state taxes payable thereon equals the amount first described above and
               (D) no amounts shall be paid or payable to Executive under the Company's performance-based incentive plans, including the then current National Oilwell Annual Incentive Plan (or such other name as may be adopted for the plan or its successor), for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs.
          (ii) Until the date of the Executive's death, the Company shall continue group health plan (as defined for purposes of section 4980B of the Code) benefits to the Executive and/or the Executive's family equal to those which would have been provided to them in accordance with the plans, programs, practices and policies described in Section 2(b)(iv) of this Agreement as if the Executive's employment had not been terminated; provided, that if the Executive's participation after the Date of Termination in such group health plan is not permitted by the terms of a plan, then for the Executive's lifetime, the Company shall provide the Executive with substantially the same benefits that were provided to the Executive by that plan immediately before the Termination Date; provided further, that if the Executive becomes reemployed by another employer and is eligible to receive any of such benefits under another employer provided plan, the benefits provided hereunder shall be secondary to those provided under such other plans. With respect to any group health plan that requires an employee contribution, for the period of time during which the Executive would be entitled (or would, but for this Agreement, be entitled to continuation coverage under a group health plan of the Company under Section 4980B of the Code if the Executive elected such coverage and paid the applicable premiums (generally, 18 months), the Executive shall pay the then active employee cost of the benefits as determined under the then current practices of the Company on a monthly, semi-annual or annual basis as elected by the Executive, and thereafter, the Executive shall pay the full cost of the benefits as determined under the then current practices of the Company on a monthly or annual basis as elected by the Executive, provided that the Company shall reimburse the Executive the amount of the costs of the benefit that is in excess of the then active employees costs for such benefits no later than 30 days following the end of the Executive's taxable year in which such reimbursable amounts are paid by the Executive, and provided further that the reimbursements provided, during the Executive's taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (with the exception of applicable lifetime maximums applicable to medical expenses or medical benefits described in Section 105(b) of the Code) and the right to reimbursement hereunder shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit or payment;
 
          (iii) The Company shall reimburse Executive for all outplacement services incurred on and prior to the last day of the second calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurs up to a maximum direct cost to the Company of up to 15% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary as of the Date of Termination Company shall reimburse Executive within 30 days after Executive provides the Company with an invoice (and any supporting documentation required by the Company) for such outplacement services, but in no event shall any such reimbursement be made after the last day of the third calendar year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurs.
          (iv) All options to purchase Common Stock held by the Executive pursuant to a stock option plan on or prior to the Date of Termination shall be governed by the terms of the option agreement or plan between the Executive, NOI, and/or the Company; and any restricted stock held by the Executive, not already vested shall be 100% vested;
          (v) Any compensation previously deferred by the Executive under a plan sponsored by the Company (together with any accrued interest or earnings thereon) shall be distributed at the earliest time permitted by such plan or, if permitted under the terms of such plan and all applicable laws, statutes or regulations governing such plans, at such other time as the Executive may elect under the terms of such plan;
          (vi) To the extent not theretofore paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or provide to the Executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Executive is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement of the Company and its affiliated companies (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits"); and
          (vii) The foregoing payments are intended to compensate the Executive for a breach of the Company's obligations and place Executive in substantially the same position had the employment of the Executive not been so terminated as a result of a breach by the Company.
     Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, if the Executive is determined by the Board (or its delegate) to be a "specified employee" (as described in Section 409A of the Code) for the year in which Executive's Date of Termination occurs, any payments or in-kind benefits due hereunder that are not permitted to be paid or provided on the date(s) specified hereunder without the imposition of additional taxes, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid in a lump sum or provided on the first business day following the six-month anniversary of the Date of Termination or, if earlier, Executive's death (the "409A Payment Date").
     (b) Death. If Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's death during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive's estate or beneficiaries, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 4(b) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive's estate and/or beneficiaries shall be entitled to receive, benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the Company and affiliated companies to the estates and beneficiaries of the Executive's peer executives of the Company and such affiliated companies under such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to death benefits, if any, in effect on the date hereof or, if more favorable, those in effect on the date of the Executive's death.
 
     (c) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination. With respect to the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as utilized in this Section 4(c) shall include, without limitation, and the Executive shall be entitled after the Disability Effective Date to receive, disability and other benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits generally provided by the Company and its affiliated companies to the Executive's disabled peer executives and/or their families in accordance with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to disability, if any, in effect generally on the date hereof or, if more favorable, those in effect at the time of the Disability.
     (d) Cause; Other Than for Good Reason. If the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than the obligation to pay to the Executive (x) his or her Annual Base Salary through the Date of Termination, (y) the amount of any compensation previously deferred by the Executive, and (z) Other Benefits, in each case to the extent theretofore unpaid. If the Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other than for Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. In such case, all Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of Termination subject to such other options or restrictions as provided by law.
5.
OTHER RIGHTS.
     Except as provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies. Except as provided herein, amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement. It is expressly agreed by the Executive that he or she shall have no right to receive, and hereby waives any entitlement to, any severance pay or similar benefit under any other plan, policy, practice or program of the Company. The Executive also agrees that to the extent he or she may be eligible for any severance pay or similar benefit under any laws providing for severance or termination benefits, such other severance pay or similar benefit shall be coordinated with the benefits owed hereunder, such that the Executive shall not receive duplicate benefits.
6.
FULL SETTLEMENT.
     (a) No Rights of Offset. The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set- off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.
 
     (b) No Mitigation Required. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.
     (c) Legal Fees. The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expense which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company or the Executive of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereto (including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.
7.
CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.
     (a) Although this Agreement is not being entered into in connection with or contingent upon a change of control of the Company, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 7) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(a), if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment, but that the Executive, after taking into account the Payments and the Gross-Up Payment, would not receive a net after-tax benefit of at least $50,000 (taking into account both income taxes and any Excise Tax) as compared to the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive resulting from an elimination of the Gross-Up Payment and a reduction of the Payments, in the aggregate, to an amount (the "Reduced Amount") such that the receipt of Payments would not give rise to any Excise Tax, then no Gross-Up Payment shall be made to the Executive and the Payments, in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.
     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 7(c), all determinations required to be made under this Section 7, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination shall be made by Ernst & Young, L.L.P., 1221 McKinney, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77010 or, as provided below, such other certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days after the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the
 
Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group affecting a change of control of the Company, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 7, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five days after the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 7(c) and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
     (c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment (or an additional Gross-Up Payment) in the event the IRS seeks higher payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable, but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim, and shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:
          (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to such claim;
          (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company;
          (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
          (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claims; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such costs and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(c), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided,
 
however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
     (d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 7(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 7(c)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 7(c), a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
     (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, any additional payments due to Executive under this Section 7 shall be paid by the Company no later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
8.
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
     The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies, provided that it shall not apply to information which is or shall become part of the public domain (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement), information that is developed by the Executive independently of such information, or knowledge or data or information that is disclosed to the Executive by a third party under no obligation of confidentiality to the Company. After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 8 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
 
9. 
SUCCESSORS.
     (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.
     (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
     (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.
10.
POST EMPLOYMENT NON-COMPETITION OBLIGATIONS.
     (a) As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to be paid to Executive hereunder, and as an additional incentive for the Company and NOI to enter into this Agreement, the Company, NOI and Executive agree to the non-competition provisions of this Section 10. Executive agrees that during the period of Executive's non-competition obligations hereunder, Executive will not, directly or indirectly for Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where the Company, NOI or any of their subsidiaries or affiliated companies are conducting any business as of the date of termination of the employment relationship or have during the previous twelve months conducted any business:
          (i) engage in any business competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates;
          (ii) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates;
          (iii) induce any officer or manager of the Company or NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such officer or manager by person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company, NOI or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.
     These non-competition obligations shall apply during Executive's employment and for a period ending on the first (1st ) anniversary date of the Date of Termination. After termination of Executive's employment these non-competition obligations shall apply only to businesses having annual revenues in excess of $10 million competitive with any line of business conducted by the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries having annual revenues in excess of $10 million for the last fiscal year prior to the time of termination. If the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates abandons a particular aspect of its business, that is, ceases such aspect of its business with the intention to permanently refrain from such aspect of its business, then this post-employment non-competition covenant shall not apply to such former aspect of that business.
 
     (b) Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit his ability to engage in certain businesses anywhere in the world during the period provided for above, but acknowledges that Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such restriction. Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 10 by Executive, and the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach after notification by the Company of any breach and Executive's failure to cure same. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Section 10, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, NOI, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from Executive and his agents involved in such breach.
     (c) The Executive, the Company and NOI each expressly acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this Agreement, including this Section 10, are deemed by each to reasonable and necessary to protect the business interests of NOI and the Company and their subsidiaries and affiliates. However, in the event that any of the restrictions contained in this Agreement, and specifically this Section 10, are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, it is the parties express intention for the restrictions herein set forth to be modified by such court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by the court, to be fully enforced.
11.
MISCELLANEOUS.
     (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.

     (b) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

     (f) This Agreement is intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to meet those requirements and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent.

In the event additional regulations or other guidance is issued under Section 409A of the Code or a court of competent jurisdiction provides additional authority concerning the application of Section 409A with respect to the payments described hereunder, then the provisions regarding such payments shall be amended to permit such payments to be made at the earliest time allowed under such additional regulations, guidance or authority that is practicable and achieves the original intent of this Agreement.
 
     , the Executive has hereunto set the Executive's hand and, pursuant to the authorization from its Board of Directors, the Company has caused these presents to be executed in its name on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF
