National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported that for its first quarter ended March 31, 2009 it earned net income of $470 million, or $1.13 per fully diluted share, compared to fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 net income of $585 million, or $1.40 per fully diluted share.

HOUSTON, TX, April 23, 2009 
In addition to reported results, the Company is also providing supplemental results, which include the combined financial results for the Company and Grant Prideco as if the April 21, 2008 acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2008. The Company's revenues and operating profit for the first quarter of 2009 were $3,481 million and $720 million, respectively. Revenues decreased 9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008, and increased 10 percent from the first quarter of 2008, on this adjusted combined basis. Operating profit flow-through, or the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue, was up 17 percent from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, on a combined basis, and down 48 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009.
New capital equipment orders during the quarter were $240 million, net of orders removed from backlog of $32 million. Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment was $9.6 billion at March 31, 2009 compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2008.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "Our solid backlog for drilling equipment enabled our Company to generate strong earnings in the first quarter, despite a sharp downturn in drilling activity and available credit to our customers. Though the pace of new capital equipment orders has slowed in the short run, we believe investment in drilling equipment will resume, to enable the industry to explore new oil and gas frontiers. Nevertheless market conditions remain very challenging, and the timing of a recovery is uncertain. We are well positioned for this market, given our strong financial resources, high cash flow, and exceptional backlog through 2010. We plan to execute strategic opportunities arising from the current downturn, both internal and external, to further enhance our business."
Rig Technology
First quarter revenues for the Rig Technology segment were $2,199 million, an increase of 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2008 and an increase of 37 percent from the first quarter of
