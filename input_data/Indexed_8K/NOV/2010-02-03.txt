Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We achieved solid results in 2009, despite the challenging market we faced throughout the year. We were able to use this time to make our businesses more efficient, while continuing to invest for future growth and better position ourselves for the inevitable recovery in drilling activity. We ended the year with $2.6 billion in cash, and cash flow remains a strength of our Company. I would like to thank all of our dedicated employees for their continued hard work.
While market conditions remain challenging, we enter 2010 with a solid backlog of equipment and technology to deliver to our customers, strong financial resources and positive cash flow. We believe that the oil and gas industry will continue to need to upgrade the world's rig fleet, and we look forward to continuing to help our customers retool their rigs to improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and drive higher efficiency."
