New orders during the quarter were $1.41 billion, reflecting higher demand for drilling equipment for new build offshore rigs, and higher demand for well intervention and stimulation equipment.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We achieved solid results in 2010. We were able to make our businesses more efficient, while continuing to invest for future growth. We spent approximately $600 million on acquisitions, launched several expansion projects across many of our existing business lines, and nevertheless ended the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash. I would like to thank all of our dedicated employees for their hard work and outstanding execution to deliver this result.
2011 looks bright as we enter the year with strong financial resources, a solid backlog, leading technology, and an experienced team capable of delivering great service and products to our customers and excellent financial results to our shareholders. We believe that the oil and gas industry will continue to need to upgrade the world's rig fleet, and we look forward to continuing to help our customers retool their rigs to improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and drive higher efficiency."
