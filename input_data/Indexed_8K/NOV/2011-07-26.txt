FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported that for its second quarter ended June 30, 2011 it earned net income of $481 million, or $1.13 per fully diluted share. Earnings per share increased 18 percent compared to both the second quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.

HOUSTON, TX, July 26, 2011 
The Company's revenues for the second quarter of 2011 were $3.51 billion, which improved 12 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and 19 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Operating profit for the second quarter of 2011 was $712 million or 20.3 percent of sales, compared to 20.2 percent in the second quarter of 2010 and 20.0 percent in the first quarter of 2011, excluding transaction charges and Libya asset write downs from all periods. Year-over-year second quarter operating profit increased 20 percent, excluding transaction charges. Sequentially, second quarter operating profit increased 13 percent, resulting in operating profit flow-through (change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue) of 23 percent, excluding transaction and restructuring charges.
During the second quarter of 2011 the Company's Rig Technology segment booked $2.96 billion in new orders. Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment was $7.74 billion at June 30, 2011, up 26 percent from the end of the first quarter.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "Our Company achieved strong earnings this quarter, thanks to the hard work of our dedicated employees, who provide great service, quality products, and remarkable technology to the oil and gas industry worldwide, every day. All three segments posted higher sequential and year-over-year revenues, and we were pleased by the record level of bookings into our capital equipment backlog, which increased again this quarter for both land and offshore rigs. The Company continues to expand organically and pursue promising acquisition opportunities, supported by its substantial financial resources and strong technology portfolio."
Rig Technology
Second quarter revenues for the Rig Technology segment were $1.89 billion, an increase of 18 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and an increase of 13 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Operating profit for this segment was $517 million, or 27.3 percent of sales. Revenue out of backlog for the segment increased 24 percent sequentially and increased 11 percent year-over-year, to $1.39 billion for the second quarter of 2011.
 
Petroleum Services & Supplies
Revenues for the second quarter of 2011 for the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment were $1.36 billion, up seven percent compared to first quarter 2011 results and up 32 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Operating profit was $249 million, or 18.3 percent of revenue, an increase of one percent from the first quarter of 2011 and an increase of 80 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Higher sequential sales in the U.S. and modest growth in international markets were partly offset by lower second quarter seasonal declines in Canada.
Distribution Services
The Distribution Services segment generated second quarter revenues of $423 million, which were up three percent from the first quarter of 2011 and up 16 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter operating profit was $26 million or 6.1 percent of sales, down seven percent from the first quarter of 2011 and up 100 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Margins were adversely affected by seasonal declines in Canada during the second quarter.
The Company has scheduled a conference call for July 26, 2011, at 8:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss second quarter results. The call will be broadcast through the Investor Relations link on National Oilwell Varco's web site at , and a replay will be available on the site for thirty days following the conference.
