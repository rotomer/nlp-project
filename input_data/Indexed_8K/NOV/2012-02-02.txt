Excluding $41 million in pre-tax transaction charges in 2011, net income was $2.02 billion, or $4.77 per fully diluted share, and operating profit was $2.98 billion or 20.3 percent of sales, for the full year 2011.

Operating profit flow-through, or the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue, was 16 percent from the third quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2011, and was 22 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011, excluding transaction charges from all periods. The Company's acquisition of Ameron was completed on October 5, 2011 and contributed to its sequential growth in revenues.
Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment at December 31, 2011 was $10.16 billion, down one percent from the third quarter of 2011, but double year-earlier levels. New orders during the quarter were $1.67 billion, reflecting continued good demand for oilfield equipment.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "We achieved solid results in 2011. The Company posted record revenues, net income, and orders for capital equipment, which at $10.8 billion for the year handily beat our previous high of $7.3 billion. We used the year to focus on efficiency and technology, while continuing to invest for future growth, to position National Oilwell Varco to capitalize on extraordinary opportunities emerging in the oil and gas industry.
We enter 2012 with strong financial resources, $3.5 billion in cash, a solid backlog, and an experienced team capable of delivering great service and products to our customers. We believe that the oil and gas industry will continue to need to upgrade the world's rig fleet, and we look forward to continuing to help our customers retool their rigs to improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and drive higher efficiency. I thank all of our dedicated employees for their hard work and outstanding execution this year."
