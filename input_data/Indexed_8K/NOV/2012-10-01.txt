Until a Lender funds its Adjusted Base Rate Advance, Eurocurrency Rate Advance or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) to refinance such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Swingline Advance, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender.

In the event, upon payment in full of such Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement and the Notes as to any Lender is less than the total amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had, at all times, been in effect, then the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lenders an amount equal to the difference between (i) the lesser of (A) the amount of interest which would have been charged on Obligations owing to such Lender if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect and (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued on such Obligations if the rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect and (ii) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement on such Obligations. In the event any Lender ever receives, collects or applies as interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Obligations owing to it, and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Borrower.
Usury Recapture
 
(e) . If any amount payable under this Agreement other than the Advances is not paid when due and payable, including accrued interest and fees, then such overdue amount shall accrue interest hereon due and payable on demand (i) if such amount is in Dollars, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (A) Adjusted Base Rate the Applicable Margin for Adjusted Base Rate Advances two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate, from the date such amount became due until the date such amount is paid in full, and (ii) if such amount is in a Foreign Currency, the lesser of (A) the greater of (1) the Adjusted Base Rate in effect from time to time the Applicable Margin for Adjusted Base Rate Advances two percent (2%) and (2) the overnight Eurocurrency Rate the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Rate Advances and any Mandatory Cost Rate for Eurocurrency Rate Advances two percent (2%) and (B) the Maximum Rate.

Computations
 
Swingline Lender) on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate for such day.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Borrower
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.6(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.11(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable;
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Credit Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
(2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a "U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate") and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a
 
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h) . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.11 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.11), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
(i) . Each party's obligations under this Section 2.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document.
Survival
Section 2.12 . If any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Legal Requirement makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful for such Lender or its Lending Office to perform its obligations under this Agreement to maintain any Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding hereunder or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or take deposits of, Dollars or any Foreign Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall, if demanded by such Lender in its notice, no later than 12:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time), (a) if not prohibited by any Legal Requirement to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the last day of the Interest Period for each outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Lender or (b) if prohibited by any Legal Requirement to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Advances for the duration of the Interest Period, on the second Business Day following its receipt of such notice from such Lender, then (i) with respect to Revolving Advances denominated in a Foreign Currency, prepay such Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding and which are denominated in such affected currency or currencies together with all accrued interest on the amount so prepaid, and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such prepayment being made on such date, and (ii) with respect to Revolving Advances denominated in Dollars, Convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding to Adjusted Base Rate Advances and pay accrued interest on the principal amount Converted to the date of such Conversion and amounts, if any, required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8 as a result of such Conversion being made on such date. Each Lender agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the effect of this paragraph and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

Each Issuing Lender shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent by telex, telephone, or facsimile (or by e-mail with a return receipt requested) which the Administrative Agent will promptly deliver to each such participant Lender, a notice of each Letter of Credit of such Issuing Lender issued, increased or decreased, and the Administrative Agent shall also notify each Lender of the actual amount of such Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit. Each Lender's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section, to make a Mandatory Revolving Borrowing as set forth in clause (d) below, to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payment under a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender not reimbursed in full by the Borrower, and to fund its participation interests in Letters of Credit as set forth below, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall

(d) . Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof (which the Administrative Agent will promptly forward to the Lenders). No later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment to be made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to any amount paid or to be paid by such Issuing Lender on such date under or in respect of such Letter of Credit and in the currency paid or to be paid by such Issuing Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the issuance of any Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, such currency ceases to be an Agreed Currency as provided in the definition of Agreed Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due (either directly by the Borrower or through a deemed borrowing under clause (i) below) in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations. In the event an Issuing Lender makes a payment pursuant to a request for draw presented under a Letter of Credit and such payment is not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower as required herein, such Issuing Lender shall give notice of such payment to the Administrative Agent (which the Administrative Agent will promptly forward to the Lenders). In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Mandatory Revolving Borrowing consisting of (i) for unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency which ceased to be an Agreed Currency, Adjusted Base Rate Advances, and (ii) for unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit denominated in Foreign Currencies, Eurocurrency Rate Advances in such Agreed Currency and in the amount of such unreimbursed amount with an Interest Period of one month; provided that, if the Revolving Commitments have terminated or otherwise expired, such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall bear interest at the overnight Eurocurrency Rate. The applicable Issuing Lender shall give the Administrative Agent notice of such deemed Borrowing (A) by 12:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the date before the proposed Borrowing is to be made in the case of an Adjusted Base Rate Advance or Eurocurrency Rate Advances bearing interest at the overnight Eurocurrency Rate and (B) by 12:00 p.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the fourth Business Day before the date of such proposed Borrowing in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance denominated in a Foreign Currency with an Interest Period of one month (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly give to each Lender). Each Lender shall, no later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice, promptly make such funds available to the applicable Issuing Lender, in the applicable currency and in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed amount. The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes, empowers, and directs the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to record and otherwise treat each payment under a Letter of Credit not immediately reimbursed by the Borrower as a Borrowing comprised of Adjusted Base Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, to the Borrower. If for any reason such Mandatory Revolving Borrowing cannot be made by any Lender, the request for such Mandatory Revolving Borrowing submitted by the applicable Issuing Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by such Issuing Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Letter of Credit and each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender
Reimbursement
 
pursuant to this clause (d) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. If the funds are not made available by a Lender to the applicable Issuing Lender on the required date (either as the making of a Revolving Advance or the funding of its participation interest in such Letters of Credit), such Lender shall pay interest thereon to the applicable Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. At any time after any Lender has funded its participation in a Letter of Credit, if the applicable Issuing Lender receives any payment on the applicable Reimbursement Obligation from the Borrower, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by such Issuing Lender. All overdue Reimbursement Obligations of the Borrower shall bear interest as set forth in Section 2.6(e).
(e) . The obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, notwithstanding the following circumstances:

(iv) any statement, draft or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect to the extent an Issuing Lender would not be liable therefor pursuant to the following paragraph (f);
(v) payment by an Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or
(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing clause (f), the Issuing Lenders may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and may refuse to accept documents that are not in strict conformity with the terms of the Letter of Credit, and any such acceptance or refusal shall not be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees set forth in Section 2.3(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.20(b).
(C) With respect to any fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender's participation in Letters of Credit that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender's Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv) . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender's participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Advances shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitment (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause any Non-Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Exposure to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation.
Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure
(b) . At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders' Fronting Exposure, as requested, with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall either (i) Cash Collateralize the Swingline Lenders' Fronting Exposure, as requested, with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount or (ii) prepay Swingline Advances in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders' Fronting Exposure as to Swingline Advances.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the
Grant of Security Interest
 
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders, and the Swingline Lenders, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
(ii) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but subject to the introductory paragraph of this Section 2.20(b), (A) Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.20(b) in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender's obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein and (B) Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.20(b) in respect of Swingline Advances shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender's obligation to fund participations in respect of Swingline Advances (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
Application
(iii) . If the reallocation described in Section 2.20(a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first prepay or Cash Collateralize the Swingline Advances as set forth above in this Section 2.20(b), and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders' Fronting Exposure as set forth above in this Section 2.20(b).
Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Advances
(iv) . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Lender's or any Swingline Lender's Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.20(b) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender) with respect to Letters of Credit and Swingline Advances, or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent, each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, the Person providing Cash Collateral, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lenders may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
Termination of Requirement
(c) . If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Advances and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Advances to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.20(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.
Defaulting Lender Cure
 
(d) . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Advances unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Advance and (ii) no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
