FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012 it earned net income of $612 million, or $1.43 per fully diluted share, compared to second quarter ended June 30, 2012 net income of $605 million, or $1.42 per fully diluted share. Earnings per share increased 14 percent compared to the third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.25 per fully diluted share.
HOUSTON, TX, October 25, 2012 
Transaction charges for the third quarter of 2012 were $57 million pre-tax. Net income for the third quarter of 2012 excluding transaction charges was $650 million, or $1.52 per fully diluted share. This compares to second quarter of 2012 net income of $626 million, or $1.46 per fully diluted share, and third quarter 2011 net income of $536 million or $1.26 per fully diluted share, excluding transaction charges from all periods.
The Company's revenues for the third quarter of 2012 were $5.3 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the second quarter of 2012 and an increase of 42 percent from the third quarter of 2011. Operating profit for the third quarter of 2012 was $946 million or 17.8 percent of sales, excluding transaction charges. Sequentially, third quarter operating profit increased four percent, resulting in operating profit flow-through (change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue) of seven percent, excluding transaction charges. Year-over-year third quarter operating profit increased 22 percent, resulting in operating profit flow-through of 11 percent, excluding transaction charges.
During the third quarter of 2012 the Company's Rig Technology segment booked $2.29 billion in new orders. Backlog for capital equipment orders for the Company's Rig Technology segment at September 30, 2012 was $11.66 billion, up three percent from the end of the second quarter of 2012.
Pete Miller, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, remarked, "Outstanding execution enabled the Company to achieve solid earnings again this quarter. We are pleased by the level of bookings into our capital equipment backlog for the Rig Technology segment during the third quarter. We continue to see steady activity around new orders, and expect high demand for deepwater rigs to drive solid orders again in the fourth quarter. Demand for other NOV products and services continued to grow in international markets, but softening demand in North America partly offset this trend during the third quarter.
Our Company has completed a number of strategic initiatives this year, and I am pleased to report that these are going very well. Our investments will further strengthen National Oilwell Varco's capabilities to service our customers, as well as provide future opportunities for our employees and earnings growth for our shareholders."
