Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 15, 2012, National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the offer and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.35% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $1,400,000,000 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.60% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), and $1,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.95% Senior Notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Notes").
The Notes were issued under an indenture (the "Base Indenture") dated as of November 20, 2012 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee relating to the issuance of the 2017 Notes (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), the Second Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee relating to the issuance of the 2022 Notes (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") and the Third Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee relating to the issuance of the 2042 Notes (the "Third Supplemental Indenture," together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture").
In certain circumstances, the Indenture restricts the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to: (i) enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (ii) incur liens on its principal properties; (iii) merge or consolidate with another entity; or (iv) sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to another entity. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.
The Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the Notes of either series, including:
 
 
 
 
If an event of default for any series of Notes issued under the Indenture occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the series affected by such default may declare the unpaid principal of, together with any accrued but unpaid premium or interest on, all the Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately. If the default concerns a breach of the Company's obligations under the Indenture (failure to perform, or breach of a covenant), then, subject to notice and grace periods, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all series of Notes affected by such default, may declare the unpaid principal of, together with any accrued but unpaid premium or interest on, all the Notes of that series (or of all series) to be due and payable immediately.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an event of default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs, then all unpaid principal of, together with any accrued but unpaid premium or interest on, all Notes outstanding under the Indenture will automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder.
The 2017 Notes will mature on December 1, 2017, the 2022 Notes will mature on December 1, 2022 and the 2042 Notes will mature on December 1, 2042. Interest is payable on the Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2013.
At any time prior to their maturity, in the case of the 2017 Notes, at any time prior to September 1, 2022 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes), in the case of the 2022 Notes, and at any time prior to June 1, 2042 (the date that is six months prior to the maturity date of the 2042 Notes), in the case of the 2042 Notes, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices specified in the First Supplemental Indenture, Second Supplemental Indenture and Third Supplemental Indenture, respectively. At any time on or after September 1, 2022 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes), in the case of the 2022 Notes, and June 1, 2042 (the date that is six months prior to the maturity date of the 2042 Notes), in the case of the 2042 Notes, the Company may redeem some or all of such Notes at the redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes or 2042 Notes redeemed, respectively.
The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsubordinated debt, and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's future subordinated debt.
The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-184953) which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 15, 2012. Other material terms of the Notes and the Indenture are described in the prospectus dated November 15, 2012, together with the prospectus supplement dated November 15, 2012 filed with the SEC on November 16, 2012 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act of 1933, which description is incorporated by reference herein.
The foregoing description is a brief summary of the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture and does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations thereunder. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the form of 2017 Note, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the form of 2022 Note, the Third Supplemental Indenture and the form of 2042 Note, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

Indemnification by the Company
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing), or in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433) or "road show" (as defined in Rule 433) that does not constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

Indemnification by the Underwriters
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder. Counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected as follows: counsel to the Underwriters and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above shall be selected by the Representatives; and counsel to the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Underwriters and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above; and the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, in each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced
Actions Against Parties; Notification
 
or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 6, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement Without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
 
Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each affiliate, officer, director, employee, partner and member of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Exhibit A
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether signed on behalf of such officer, the Company or such subsidiary) and delivered to the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any officer, director, employee, partner, member or agent of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, any officer, director or employee of the Company or any person controlling the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(b) .

Exhibit B
 
(1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(2) The Company has corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
(3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(4) Each of the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity.
(5) The Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity.
(6) The Registration Statement has become effective under the 1933 Act; the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) (without reference to Rule 424(b)(8)); any required filing of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d); and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted by or are pending before the Commission.
(7) The Registration Statement, at the time it first became effective, and the Registration Statement (including the Rule 430B Information), at each deemed new effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2), and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, as of their respective dates, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations; it being understood, however, that such counsel need express no
 
view with respect to the Form T-1, Regulation S-T or the financial statements, schedules or other financial data, included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. For purposes of this paragraph, such counsel may assume that the statements made in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are correct and complete.
(8) The statements included in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Securities, are accurate summaries of the terms thereof in all material respects. The statements included in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," to the extent that such statements purport to describe or summarize the legal matters therein, accurately summarize in all material respects such legal matters.
(9) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each of the Transaction Documents, the issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance by the Company with the terms thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except for such filings, consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as may be required under applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and any consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification that has been obtained or made, or which if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to this paragraph (9), such counsel need not express any opinion with respect to consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as may be required under applicable federal or state antifraud laws, rules or regulations.
(10) The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Transaction Documents do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default, Termination Event or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any Company Document, except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any government, government instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, properties or operations, excluding any anti-fraud or similar law, rule or regulation.
(11) The Company is not, and, upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and the receipt and application of the net proceeds
 
therefrom as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds," will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, such counsel shall state that, in acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants and counsel for the Company and representatives of the Underwriters, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments to any of the foregoing, and related matters were discussed. Although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any supplements and amendments to any of the foregoing, and has made no independent check or verification thereof (except as set forth in paragraph 8 above), nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that
(1) the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendments thereto, at the respective times they first became effective, or the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendments thereto (in each case including the Rule 430B Information), at each deemed new effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
(2) the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
(3) the Prospectus and any supplements thereto, as of the date of the Prospectus, as of the date of any such supplement or as of the date of this letter, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except in each case that such counsel expresses no view with respect to the Form T-1, Regulation S-T or the financial statements, schedules and other financial or statistical data included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing.
Except as otherwise provided herein, in the event that such opinion shall define the term "Registration Statement," "Pre-Pricing Prospectus," or "Prospectus" (rather than indicating that such terms, as used in such opinion, have the respective meanings given thereto in the Underwriting Agreement), such opinion shall define the terms "Registration Statement," "Pre-Pricing Prospectus" and "Prospectus" to include the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
 
In rendering such opinion, Company Counsel shall state that such opinion covers matters arising under the laws of the States of Texas and New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States of America. In rendering such opinion, Company Counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
 
To such counsel's knowledge, except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending or threatened, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or which might reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
Such opinion shall define the term "knowledge" to mean the actual knowledge of such counsel after inquiry of personnel of the Company who have responsibility for the subject matter of such opinion.
In the event that such opinion shall define the term "Registration Statement," "General Disclosure Package" or "Prospectus" (rather than indicating that such terms, as used in such opinion, have the respective meanings given thereto in the Underwriting Agreement), such opinion shall define the terms "Registration Statement," "General Disclosure Package" and "Prospectus" to include the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.

Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters is or are erroneous.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
 
(a) Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the Holders of a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securities may take action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any direction, notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the Holders of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (i) by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by Holders in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, (ii) by the record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance with hereof, (iii) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders or (iv) in the case of Securities evidenced by a global Security, by any electronic transmission or other message, whether or not in written format, that complies with the Depositary's applicable procedures. Such evidence (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "t" of the relevant Holders. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or the holding of any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to ) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in .

Section 601
Section 1306
The Company may set in advance a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Securities entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, those Persons who were Holders of Outstanding Securities at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled with respect to such Securities to take such action by vote or consent or to revoke any vote or consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice thereof to be given to the Trustee in writing in the manner provided in and to the relevant Holders as set forth in .

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other Person authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. Any Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or other Act as to its Security or portion of its Security; , , that such revocation shall be effective only if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the Act becomes effective.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
 
 
 
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) (i) with respect to Securities evidenced by a global Security, in accordance with the Depository's applicable procedures, and (ii) with respect to other Securities, if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, in either case not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service, or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case in which notice to Holders of Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with any provision of the Trust Indenture Act (or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required to be included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act), such provision of the Trust Indenture Act (or such other provision hereof which is required by the Trust Indenture Act) shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the former provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded.
 
The Article and Section headings, the Cross-Reference Table and the Table of Contents herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
 
All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture will bind its successors.
 
In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, any Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent and Security Registrar, and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
 
This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
EACH OF THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE SECURITIES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
 
In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities) payment of principal and interest (and premium and Additional Amounts, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.
 
No recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, against any incorporator, subscriber to the capital stock, stockholder, officer, director or employee of the Company or the Trustee or of any predecessor or successor of the Company or the Trustee with respect to the Company's obligations on the Securities or the obligations of the Company or the Trustee under this Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith.
 
In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
 
The Company acknowledges that in accordance with Section 326 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, the Trustee, like all financial institutions and in order to help fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering, is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Person or legal entity that establishes a relationship or opens an account with the Trustee. The Company agrees that it will provide the Trustee with such information as it may request in order for the Trustee to satisfy the requirements of the U.S.A. Patriot Act.

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder, member, manager or partner of the Company, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities, or this Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Securities by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. Such waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Securities.
 
The Securities of each series shall be in fully registered form and in substantially such form or forms (including temporary or permanent global form) as shall be established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of the Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form as permitted by , the form thereof shall be established as provided in the preceding sentence. A copy of the Board Resolution establishing the form or forms of Securities of any series (or any such temporary global Security) shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by for the authentication and delivery of such Securities (or any such temporary global Security).

Any Security in global form may be deposited with the Depositary or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Security Custodian therefor pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depositary. If a Company Order pursuant to or has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security (without surrender thereof save in the case of a mutilated Security).
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fee and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Defaulted Interest
 
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture, upon registration of transfer of, in exchange for or in lieu of, any other Security, shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any)
