Item 5. Other Events
On December 5, 2001 NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) and Connecticut Light and Power filed a request with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for an increase in the standard offer rate paid to energy suppliers. The increase was requested to cover higher costs related to recent environmental legislation and anticipated higher charges for transmission service. The increase would have contributed approximately $5 million of net income per month to NRG.
On June 17, 2002 the DPUC ruled the parties were not entitled to the requested increase.
NRG is evaluating its options in response to this decision, including the DPUC recommendation to "pursue all avenues through ISO NE (ISO New England, Inc., the transmission system operator) for appropriate cost recovery for must-run units."
