In the event that any Sponsor Equity Contribution is not made on the related Equity Contribution Date, the amount of such delinquent Sponsor Equity Contribution shall bear interest at the Default Rate (computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year, as the case may be, and the actual days elapsed) until such time as such Sponsor Equity Contribution is made. 2.3 Equity Contribution Support. If at any time during the term of this Agreement Sponsor's senior unsecured non-credit enhanced long-term debt is rated below "BBB-" by S&P or "Baa3" by Moody's or ceases to be rated by either S&P or Moody's (a "Downgrade Event"), then, within 15 Banking Days from the occurrence of any such Downgrade Event, Sponsor shall deliver to Administrative Agent the Equity Contribution Support Instrument in a stated amount which shall at all times provide for an amount available to be drawn thereunder that is greater than or equal to the aggregate amount of Sponsor Equity Contributions remaining to be paid hereunder (as reasonably determined by Administrative Agent, after consultation with Borrower). If an Equity Contribution Support Instrument is delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence, Sponsor shall cause such Equity Contribution Support Instrument to remain in full force and effect until the cessation of such Downgrade Event. If for any reason the full amount of any Sponsor Equity Contribution is not made by Sponsor on the relevant Equity Contribution Date, Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed to immediately make a claim 11
under the Equity Contribution Support Instrument for an amount equal to the amount of the Sponsor Equity Contribution that was to have been made on such date. Payments made under the Equity Contribution Support Instrument pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to have been Sponsor Equity Contributions, provided, however, that any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.3 which is rescinded or otherwise restored to the issuer of the Equity Contribution Support Instrument shall not be considered a Sponsor Equity Contribution hereunder and, promptly upon any such recision or restoration, Sponsor shall cause the Equity Contribution Support Instrument to be restored to the extent of the amount of such recision or restoration. 2.4 Waiver of Defenses; Obligations Unconditional. 2.4.1. Waiver of Defenses. Sponsor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies accorded by applicable Legal Requirements to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including (a) any right to require Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties to proceed against any Portfolio Entity or any other Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties at any time or to pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or any other Secured Party's power before proceeding against Sponsor, (b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger, termination or disability of any Portfolio Entity or any other Person or the failure of Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any Portfolio Entity or any other Person, (c) demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind, including notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of any Portfolio Entity, Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties, any endorser or creditor of the foregoing or on the part of any other Person under this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties as collateral or in connection with any Obligations, (d) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties, including an election to proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Sponsor, the right of Sponsor to proceed against a Portfolio Entity or another Person for reimbursement, or both, (e) any defense based on any offset against any amounts which may be owed by any Person to Sponsor for any reason whatsoever, (f) any defense based on any act, failure to act, delay or omission whatsoever on the part of a Portfolio Entity of the failure by a Portfolio Entity to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement to be observed or performed by it under the Credit Documents, (g) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal, (h) any defense, setoff or counterclaim which may at any time be available to or asserted by a Portfolio Entity against Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties or any other Person under the Credit Documents, (i) any duty on the part of Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to disclose to Sponsor any facts Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may now or hereafter know about any Portfolio Entity, regardless of whether Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which Sponsor intends to assume, or have reason to 12
believe that such facts are unknown to Sponsor, or have a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Sponsor, since Sponsor acknowledges that Sponsor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of the Portfolio Entities and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment of any obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (j) the fact that any Portfolio Entity may at any time in the future dispose of all or part of its direct or indirect interest in any other Portfolio Entity, (k) any defense based on any change in the time, manner or place of any payment under, or in any other term of, the Credit Documents or any other amendment, renewal, extension, acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or departure from the terms of the Credit Documents, (l) any defense arising because of Administrative Agent's or any other Secured Party's election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and (m) any defense based upon any borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 2.4.2. Obligations Unconditional. All rights of Administrative Agent, the Secured Parties and all obligations of Sponsor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any Note, this Agreement, or any other Credit Document; (b) the failure of any Secured Party or any holder of any Note: (i) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Borrower, Sponsor, any other Portfolio Entity or any other Person (including any guarantor) under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any Note, any other Credit Document or otherwise, or (ii) to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of, or collateral securing, any of the Obligations; (c) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all of the Obligations, or any other extension or renewal of any Obligation of Borrower, Sponsor or any other Portfolio Entity; (d) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of any of the Obligations for any reason other than the written agreement of the Secured Parties to terminate the Obligations in full, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to, and Sponsor hereby waives any right to or claim of, any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability of, or any other event or occurrence affecting, any Obligation of Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity or otherwise; 13
(e) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Note, this Agreement, or any other Credit Document; (f) any addition, exchange, release, surrender or non-perfection of any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or release or addition of, or consent to departure from, any other security interest held by any Secured Party or any holder of any Note securing any of the Obligations; or (g) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the Borrower, any other Portfolio Entity, Sponsor, any surety or any guarantor. 2.5 Subrogation. So long as this Agreement remains in effect, (a) Sponsor shall not have any right of subrogation and waives all rights to enforce any remedy which the Secured Parties now have or may hereafter have against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, and waives the benefit of, and all rights to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party from Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity and (b) Sponsor waives any claim, right or remedy which Sponsor may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity that arises hereunder and/or from the performance by Sponsor hereunder, including any claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, or participation in any claim, right or remedy of the Secured Parties against Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or any security which the Secured Parties now have or hereafter acquire, whether or not such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise. Any amount paid to Sponsor on account of any such subrogation rights prior to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations, the termination of all Interest Rate Agreements as to which any Secured Party is the counterparty and the termination of all Commitments and other obligations of the Secured Parties under the Credit Documents shall be held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent and shall immediately thereafter be paid to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties. 14
ARTICLE 3. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS 3.1 Reinstatement. This Agreement and the obligations of Sponsor hereunder shall automatically be reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment made pursuant to this Agreement is rescinded or otherwise restored to Sponsor, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise with respect to Borrower or any other Person or as a result of any settlement or compromise with any Person (including Sponsor) in respect of such payment, and Sponsor shall pay Administrative Agent on demand all of its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with such rescission or restoration. 3.2 Specific Performance. Sponsor hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent it may do so under applicable Legal Requirements, any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law that may be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance in any action brought against Sponsor for specific performance of this Agreement by Borrower or any successor or assign thereof (including Administrative Agent) or for their benefit by a receiver, custodian or trustee appointed for Borrower or in respect of all or a substantial part of its assets, under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of any jurisdiction to which Borrower or its assets are subject. 3.3 Bankruptcy Code Waiver. Sponsor hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent it may do so under applicable Legal Requirements, any protection to which it may be entitled under Sections 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) and 365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law or equivalent provisions of the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction with respect to any proceedings, or any successor provision of law of similar import, in the event of any Bankruptcy Event. Specifically, in the event that the trustee (or similar official) in a Bankruptcy Event or the debtor-in-possession takes any action (including the institution of any action, suit or other proceeding for the purpose of enforcing the rights of Borrower under this Agreement), Sponsor shall not assert any defense, claim or counterclaim denying liability hereunder on the basis that this Agreement is an executory contract or a "financial accommodation" that cannot be assumed, assigned or enforced or on any other theory directly or indirectly based on Section 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) or 365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law, or equivalent provisions of the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction with respect to any proceedings or any successor provision of law of similar import. If a Bankruptcy Event shall occur, Sponsor agrees, after the occurrence of the Bankruptcy Event, to reconfirm in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, its pre-petition waiver of any protection to which it may be entitled under Sections 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) and 365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law or equivalent provisions of the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction with respect to proceedings and, to give effect to such waiver, Sponsor consents to the assumption and enforcement of each provision of this Agreement by the debtor-in-possession or Borrower's trustee in bankruptcy, as the case may be. 3.4 No Commencement of Bankruptcy Proceedings. So long as the Credit Documents remain in effect, Sponsor shall not, without the prior written consent of Required Banks, commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against any Affiliate Pledgor, the Member, Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity. The obligations of Sponsor under this Agreement shall not be altered, limited or 15
affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement of any Affiliate Pledgor, the Member, Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity, or by any defense which any Affiliate Pledgor, the Member, Borrower or any other Portfolio Entity may have by reason of any order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding. 3.5 Grant of Security Interest; Actions by Administrative Agent. Sponsor hereby consents to the assignment by Borrower of all of its right, title and interest in, to and under this Agreement to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, pursuant to Borrower Security Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by Borrower in favor of Administrative Agent. Sponsor agrees that Administrative Agent and any assignee thereof shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement in its own name and to exercise any and all rights of Borrower under this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof (either in its own name or in the name of Borrower, as Administrative Agent may elect), and Sponsor and Borrower agree to comply and cooperate in all respects with such exercise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent and any assignee thereof shall have the full right and power to enforce directly against Sponsor all obligations of Sponsor under this Agreement, and otherwise to exercise all remedies available to Borrower hereunder and to make all demands and give all notices (including any Sponsor Turbine Contribution Notice or any Completion Contribution Notice) and make all requests (either in its own name or in the name of Borrower, as Administrative Agent may elect) required or permitted to be made or given by Borrower under this Agreement, including the right to make demand for payment of Sponsor Equity Contributions pursuant to Article 2 and to make a claim under the Equity Contribution Support Instrument, and Sponsor acknowledges and agrees that any such action taken by Administrative Agent shall be deemed effective for all purposes of this Agreement to the same extent as if such action had been taken directly by Borrower. If Sponsor shall receive inconsistent directions from Borrower and Administrative Agent, the directions of Administrative Agent shall be deemed the effective directions, and Sponsor shall accordingly comply with such directions of Administrative Agent. 3.6 Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable Legal Requirements or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon (a) the failure of Sponsor to make any Sponsor Equity Contribution as required hereunder, and (b) the failure of the issuer of the Equity Contribution Support Instrument to make such payment in accordance with its terms, Administrative Agent is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to Sponsor or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Secured Party (including by branches and agencies of each of the Secured Parties wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of Sponsor, against and on account of the obligations of Sponsor under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not Administrative Agent shall have made any demand hereunder and although said obligations, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. 16
ARTICLE 4. PURCHASE OF PARTICIPATING INTEREST 4.1 Required Purchase of Participating Interest. If by reason of a Bankruptcy Event or any act of a Governmental Authority, (a) any Sponsor Equity Contribution due hereunder has not been deposited in the applicable account within five Banking Days after the date on which such amount is payable hereunder or has not been deposited in the applicable account within five Banking Days after demand shall have been made on the Equity Contribution Support Instrument hereunder, whichever is later, or (b) any Sponsor Equity Contribution theretofore deposited pursuant to Article 2 is rescinded or otherwise restored to Sponsor or the issuer of the Equity Support Instrument and five days have elapsed after the date that such Sponsor Equity Contribution was rescinded or otherwise restored (such Sponsor Equity Contribution, whether required but not made as provided in clause (a) or made and returned to Sponsor as provided in clause (b), being herein called the "Defaulted Payment"), Sponsor shall, within five days after demand upon Sponsor by Administrative Agent, purchase an undivided participating interest in each of the Loans which shall then be outstanding, as provided in the following sentence, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of the Defaulted Payment. Sponsor's purchase of an undivided participating interest in such Loans shall be made pro rata among such Loans based on the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof. Sponsor shall effect its purchase of undivided participating interests in such Loans pursuant to this Section 4.1 by paying to Administrative Agent, for the account of the holders of such Loans, in immediately available funds in Dollars, the amount of the Defaulted Payment. 4.2 Effect of Purchase of Participating Interest. Sponsor's purchase of an undivided participating interest in the Loans in the full amount (if any) required pursuant to Section 4.1 following a Defaulted Payment in respect of Sponsor Equity Contributions, shall satisfy Sponsor's obligation pursuant to Section 2.1 to make Sponsor Equity Contributions to the extent of the amount of such Loans so purchased by Sponsor. 4.3 Subordinate Nature of Participating Interest. Sponsor hereby agrees that its participating interest in the Loans purchased by it pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be subordinate in all respects to the interest in such Loans retained by the holders (other than Sponsor) thereof (the "Retained Interest"), so that all payments received or collected on account of such Loans and applied to the payment thereof, whether received or collected through repayment of such Loans by Borrower or through right of set-off with respect thereto or realization upon any collateral security therefor or otherwise, shall first be applied to the payment of the principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due (whether at its stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) on the Retained Interest until such principal, interest, fees and other amounts are paid in full, before any such payments are applied on account of Sponsor's participating interest in such Loans. 4.4 Rights of Administrative Agent and Secured Parties. Notwithstanding the purchase and ownership by Sponsor of participating interests in the Loans, and notwithstanding the rights of participants under the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent and, to the extent permitted, each Secured Party shall have the right, in its sole discretion in each instance and without any notice to Sponsor, (a) to agree to the modification or waiver of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (but not to 17
reduce any amount payable in respect of the portion of the Loans subject to participations purchased pursuant to Section 4.1), (b) to consent to any action or failure to act by Borrower, the Member, Sponsor or any Portfolio Entity or any other Person party to a Credit Document, and (c) to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights or remedies which Administrative Agent or any Secured Party may have under the Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto, including the right at any time to declare, or refrain from declaring, the Obligations due and payable upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and to rescind and annul any such declaration, and to foreclose and sell or exercise any other remedy, or refrain from foreclosing and selling or exercising any other remedy, with respect to any collateral securing the Obligations. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Secured Party shall be liable to Sponsor for any error in judgment or for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it while Sponsor holds a participating interest in the Loans, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any duty or responsibility to provide Sponsor with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of Borrower or any other party to a Credit Document which may come into their possession or the possession of any of their respective affiliates, or to notify Sponsor of any Project Default, Project Inchoate Default, Inchoate Default or Event of Default or any default by Borrower or any other Person under any of the Credit Documents. 4.5 No Voting Rights. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 4.4, in determining whether the required consent of Banks (or any portion thereof) has been obtained for all purposes under the Credit Documents, the participating interests in the Loans purchased by Sponsor pursuant to Section 4.1 shall not be deemed to be outstanding. 4.6 Obligations Unconditional. The obligation of Sponsor under this Section 4 to purchase participating interests in the Loans is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of any Project Default, Project Inchoate Default, Inchoate Default or Event of Default or any other circumstance, including any circumstance of the nature described in Section 2.4.
