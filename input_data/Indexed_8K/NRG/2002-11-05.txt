Item 5. Other Events
On November 1, 2002, NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. ("Xcel"), announced it will not make a $9.6 million interest payment due on November 1, 2002 on $240 million in eight percent senior unsecured notes. NRG has until December 1, 2002 to make payment on the corporate level bond to avoid default.
In addition, NRG announced that on October 1, 2002, that it did not make payments on two debt issues, a $13 million interest payment on $350 million in 7.75 percent senior unsecured notes due 2011 and a $21.6 million interest payment on $500 million in 8.625 percent senior unsecured notes due in 2031. The 30-day grace period to make payment ended on October 31, 2002 and NRG did not make the required payments. As a result, NRG is in default on these bonds.
As with all NRG debt issues, these are non-recourse to the parent company, Xcel Energy. NRG plans to address these payments in a broader restructuring plan and is working with bondholders to resolve this issue.
