Item 8.01 Other Events
On March 30, 2005, NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, filed a Form 8-K which set forth the Transactional Pro Forma Analysis reflecting the impact of the redemption and purchase of $415.8 million of the Company's 8% second priority senior secured notes due 2013 (the "8% Notes") filed in connection with the registration of the Company's 4% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") on a Registration Statement on Form S-3/A and the 8% Notes on a Registration Statement on Form S-4/A. This Current Report on Form 8-K is being amended to file additional pro forma results for the three months ended March 31, 2005.
Set forth below is an unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations and earnings per share information reflecting the impact of the redemption and purchase of $415.8 million of NRG's 8% Notes, which occurred in the first quarter of 2005.
Transactional Pro Forma Analysis:
The proceeds for the Preferred Stock enabled NRG to redeem and cancel $375 million of the 8% Notes. The remaining $40.8 million of the 8% Notes were purchased in the market in early 2005.
The unaudited pro forma statement of operations is based on the statement of operations of NRG and has been prepared to reflect the decrease in interest expense and refinancing expense assuming the redemption and purchase of the 8% Notes had occurred on December 31, 2003. The unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2005 already reflects the redemption and purchase of the 8% Notes as of March 31, 2005.
These unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with NRG's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2005 and NRG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 10, 2005.
