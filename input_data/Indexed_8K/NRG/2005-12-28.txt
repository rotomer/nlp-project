Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 27, 2005, NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into two purchase and sale agreements with Dynegy Inc., or Dynegy, the wholly owned parent of Dynegy Holdings Inc. through which the companies will each simultaneously purchase the other's interest in two jointly held entities that own power generation facilities in California and Illinois, respectively. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the California interests, NRG will acquire Dynegy's 50 percent interest in WCP (Generation) Holdings LLC, or WCP, for a purchase price of $205 million. As a result of this transaction, NRG will become the sole owner of power plants totaling approximately 1,800 megawatts in southern California. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the Illinois interests, NRG will sell to Dynegy its 50 percent ownership interest in the jointly held entity that owns the Rocky Road power plant, a 330-megawatt natural gas-fired peaking facility near Chicago for a purchase price of $45 million. NRG will effectively fund the net purchase price of $160 million with cash held by WCP. The transactions, which are conditioned upon each other and subject to regulatory approval, are expected to close in the first quarter 2006.
The purchase agreements regarding the California interests and the Illinois interests are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that such notice is in any event given within the survival periods stated in , the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this , except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under this .

Third Party Claims
Section 8.5
Section 8
Section 8
     A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor.
(ii)
Section 8
 
     If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and (2) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor.
(iii)
     If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Party's settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period.

Section 8.7(a)(ii)
Section 8.7(a)(ii)
     
(b) Non Third Party Claims.
     Each Party shall deliver to the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this written notice of any claims for indemnification under this , other than Third Party Claims, which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the

     A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this (a ""). If the potential Indemnitor does not provide a Response Notice to the Indemnified Party within the required 30-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to accept liability for all Losses described in the claim notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide a Response Notice within such 30-day time period the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such claim to an officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the potential Indemnitor does provide a Response Notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice within the 30-day period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period.

Section 7.2
     (b) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to or , as applicable, and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor.
Section 7.1
Section 7.2
     (c) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim,
 
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor.
     (d) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Party's settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from
Section 4
Third Party Claims
 
any of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Agreement.
     (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim.
Section 4
     (iii) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith, including by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim including but not limited to the assistance and participation of Lynn Lednicky. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any material non-monetary obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party, or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim, (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense (subject to above), and (2) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor.

     (iv) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in above within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Party's settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Section 4.2(a)(ii)
 
potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period.
Section 4.2(a)(ii)
       (b) .
Non Third Party Claims
     (i) Each Party shall deliver to the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this written notice of any claims for indemnification under this other than Third Party Claims, which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, and a good faith estimate of the actual or future potential amount of Losses.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide a Response Notice within such 30-day time period the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such claim to an officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the potential Indemnitor does provide a Response Notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice within the 30-day period.

Third Party Claims
     (i) Each Party shall, with reasonable promptness after obtaining knowledge thereof, provide the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this with written notice of all third party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or assessments that may be subject to the indemnification provisions of this , (collectively, ""), which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, a good faith estimate of the amount of Losses claimed by the third party and copies of any pleadings or demands from the third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that such notice is in any event given within the survival periods stated in , the failure to provide such notice reasonably promptly shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this , except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure, and shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party otherwise than under this .

Third Party Claims
Section 8.5
Section 8
Section 8
 
     (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this and, if so, whether the Indemnitor elects to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (subject to the consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be withheld unreasonably) and at its sole risk and expense, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if legal counsel to the Indemnified Party determines, in writing provided to Indemnitor, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest which makes it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel (such counsel subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnitor), with the reasonable costs and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the Indemnitor.
Section 8
     (iii) If within 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnitor in connection therewith including, without limitation, by making available to the Indemnitor all relevant information and the testimony of employees material to the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to approve any proposed settlement that would impose any obligation or duty on the Indemnified Party or include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable law on the part of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor is diligently and in good faith contesting the Third Party Claim (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in all aspects of, but not conduct or control, the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel and advisors chosen by the Indemnified Party, at its expense, and (2) the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim at any time without the consent of the Indemnitor, provided that the terms and conditions of such settlement involve solely the payment of money damages and the Indemnified Party waives any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnitor.
     (iv) If the potential Indemnitor does not provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby or if the potential Indemnitor fails to either contest or undertake settlement negotiations in connection with the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have the right to contest, settle or reach a compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim at its exclusive discretion, at the risk and expense of the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor will thereby waive any claim, defense or argument that the Indemnified Party's settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim is in any respect inadequate or unreasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide the notice described in within the 30-day period required thereby, the potential Indemnified Party shall
Section 8.7(a)(ii)
Section 8.7(a)(ii)
 
provide one fax notice of such Third Party Claim to the chief legal officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the Potential Indemnitor still does not provide the required notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the Third Party Claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide notice within the 30-day period.
     (b) Non Third Party Claims.
     (i) Each Party shall deliver to the other Party or parties against whom a claim for indemnification is to be made under this written notice of any claims for indemnification under this , other than Third Party Claims, which notice shall include a statement of the basis of the claim for indemnification, including a summary of the facts or circumstances that form the basis for the claim, and a good faith estimate of the actual or future potential amount of Losses.
Section 8
Section 8
     (ii) A potential Indemnitor shall have 30 days after its receipt of the claim notice to notify the potential Indemnified Party in writing whether or not the potential Indemnitor agrees that the claim is subject to this (a ""). If the potential Indemnitor does not provide a Response Notice to the Indemnified Party within the required 30-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to accept liability for all Losses described in the claim notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the potential Indemnitor fails to provide a Response Notice within such 30-day time period the potential Indemnified Party shall provide one fax notice of such claim to an officer of the potential Indemnitor. If the potential Indemnitor does provide a Response Notice within three days after receipt of such fax notice, the potential Indemnitor shall not be deemed by such failure to have accepted liability for the claim except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice within the 30-day period.
