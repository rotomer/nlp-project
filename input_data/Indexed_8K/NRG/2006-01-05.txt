Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, is furnishing the slides included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K because they are being provided to potential financing sources.
Certain of the slides in Exhibit 99.1 contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions and include, but are not limited to statements regarding the expected timing of the closing of the acquisition, and can be identified by the use of words such as "will," "would," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "forecast," "plan," "believe," and similar terms. Although NRG believes that its expectations are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct, and actual results may vary materially. NRG undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Factors that could cause NRG's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements included in this news release should be considered in connection with information regarding risks and uncertainties that may affect NRG's future results included in NRG's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at
www.sec.gov.
Certain of the slides in Exhibit 99.1 also contain non-GAAP financial information. The reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial information to GAAP financial measures, to the extent available without unreasonable effort, is included in Exhibit 99.1
