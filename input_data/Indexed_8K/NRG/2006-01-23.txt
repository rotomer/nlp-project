The lignite used to fuel the Limestone facility is obtained from a surface mine adjacent to the facility under an amended long-term contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC, entered into in August 1999. TWCC is responsible for performing ongoing reclamation activities at the mine until all lignite reserves have been produced.

The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of approximately $70 million on TWCC for the reclamation of this lignite mine.

(b) Recent Events
     Saguaro Power Company ("SPC"), located in Henderson, Nevada, is a 50%-owned, 46 net MW cogeneration plant that operates on natural gas. During 2005, the increase in the price of natural gas combined with the expiration of SPC's gas supply contract reduced SPC's operating margins, causing this investment to incur net losses after the summer peak season. In January 2006, NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG") concluded an assessment of the value of its SPC equity investment and decided to write it down by approximately $27 million. This non-cash write down is subject to NRG's year-end audit and is expected to be included in NRG's 2005 results of operations.
