EXPLANATORY NOTE
     This Form 8-K/A is being filed to update our previously filed pro forma financial statements to include the final pricing and terms for the registration of unsecured debt securities, preferred stock and common stock, and the non-registered bank credit facility, the issuance of which are together referred to as the Financing Transactions. The final pricing and terms include a final detailed disclosure of the tranches of the unsecured debt securities, their annual interest rate and term.
     At the Company's election, on a pro forma basis as of September 30, 2005, consideration with a fair value of $368 million, or the Other Consideration, may be comprised of either an additional 9,038,125 shares of common stock, additional cash, shares of a new series of NRG's Cumulative Preferred Stock or a combination of the foregoing. This Form 8-K/A assumes that the Other Consideration will be paid in cash only, instead of Cumulative Preferred Stock.
     This Form 8-K/A includes additional sensitivity analysis disclosures related to the pricing of common stock only. This Form 8-K/A further updates the following footnotes related to the Financing Transactions: footnotes 2,4,9,11,17 and 18 to the Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2005, footnotes 4, 9, and 16 to the Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005, footnotes 4, 8 and 16 to the Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2004, footnotes 4, 5 and 6 to the Pro Forma Combined Earnings Per Share Statement for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 and footnote 4 and 5 to the Pro Forma Combined Earnings Per Share Statement for the Year Ended December 31, 2004.
Item 8.01 Other Events
     NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 to register unsecured debt securities, preferred stock and common stock, and the non-registered bank credit facility, the issuance of which are together referred to as the Financing Transactions. The Financing Transactions will be entered into to finance the Acquisition (described below) and re-capitalize the Company. In connection with this registration statement, NRG is filing the unaudited pro forma analyses as set forth below.
     On September 30, 2005, NRG entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the "Acquisition Agreement") with Texas Genco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Texas Genco"), and each of the direct and indirect owners of Texas Genco (the "Sellers"). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests in Texas Genco (the "Acquisition"). We expect to close this transaction during the first quarter of 2006.
     On a pro forma basis, we estimate that the total purchase price will be $6.121 billion. This amount is comprised of common stock, cash and capitalized expenses. The number of shares to be issued to the Sellers is 35,406,320, of this amount 19,346,788 are from treasury and 16,059,532 are newly issued shares, at a price of $45.37 which is the average NRG share price immediately before and after the pro forma date of closing, or September 30, 2005, with a total value of $1.6 billion for the shares. NRG will pay $4.399 billion in cash and will capitalize expenses of $116 million. The purchase includes the assumption by the Company of approximately $2.74 billion of Texas Genco indebtedness. As a result of the Acquisition, Texas Genco will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
     Of the pro forma $6.121 billion consideration to the Sellers upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Company is paying $4.399 billion in cash, and must issue a minimum of 35,406,320 shares of the Company's common stock. At the Company's election, the Other Consideration with a fair value of $368 million may be comprised of either an additional 9,038,125 shares of common stock, additional cash, shares of a new series of NRG's Cumulative Preferred Stock or a combination of the foregoing. If issued, the aggregate liquidation preference of the Cumulative Preferred Stock will be equal to the average trading value of 9,038,125 shares of the Company's common stock over a twenty trading day period prior to closing. If the Company elects to pay all or a portion of the remaining purchase price in cash, the amount payable in cash would be calculated in the same manner. On a pro forma basis we have assumed that the Other Consideration will be paid in cash.
     NRG expects to finance the cash requirements of the Acquisition through a combination of a new senior secured credit facility, an unsecured high yield notes offering and the sale of common and preferred equity securities in the public markets. We have received a commitment letter from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley"), Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. ("Citigroup") and other institutional lenders, to provide us with up to $5.2 billion in senior secured debt financing, including up to $3.2 billion under a senior first priority term loan facility, up to $1 billion under a senior first priority secured revolving credit facility and up to $1 billion under a senior first priority secured synthetic letter of credit facility. We increased the amount of the senior first priority term loan
Table of Contents
portion of the senior secured debt financing from $3.2 billion to $3.575 billion, as reflected in the pro forma financial information included in this Form 8-K/A. The commitment letter further provides for up to $5.1 billion in bridge financing to fund all necessary amounts not provided for under the senior secured debt financing. NRG does not intend to draw down on the bridge financing unless the contemplated high yield debt financing and preferred and common equity financings are for some reason unavailable at the time of the closing. The commitment letter is subject to customary conditions to consummation, including the absence of any event or circumstance that would have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations, taken as a whole, of Texas Genco, or Texas Genco and NRG combined, since June 30, 2005. We have agreed to pay Morgan Stanley and Citigroup $44.6 million in connection with the commitment letter, or the Bridge Loan Commitment Fee, and have agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and Citigroup against certain liabilities.
     The Financing Transactions will enable us to refinance our outstanding Second Priority Notes and Credit Facility. This Credit Facility includes a senior secured term loan, a revolving credit facility and funded letter of credit facility. In addition, the new financing will supply the source of funds to acquire Texas Genco and to repay their Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes. The following is a brief summary of the companies' outstanding debt instruments that we expect to refinance with the new debt structure:
     Based on the final pricing, the following interest rates have been used for the new debt instruments during the year ended December 31, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005:
     On January 17, 2006 the Company entered into a number of forward interest rate swaps to effectively fix the London Interbank Offering Rate interest rate for part of the new term loan, as described in the table below:
     NRG will pay an annual fee of 0.5% for the new revolving credit facility, and when drawn upon, the adjustable interest rate would be the London Interbank Offering Rate plus 2%. There is an annual fee of 2% to have access to the synthetic letter of credit facility.
     On May 19, 2005, pursuant to the exercise of a right of first refusal by Texas Genco, subsequent to a third party offer to American Electric Power, or AEP, in early 2004, Texas Genco acquired from AEP an additional 13.2% undivided interest in South Texas Project, or STP. We refer to that acquisition as the "ROFR." As a result, Texas Genco now owns a 44.0% undivided interest in STP. For pro forma purposes, NRG has accounted for the ROFR as a business acquisition and included the ROFR in our pro forma adjustments to the statements of operation.
     On December 8, 2005 NRG entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell all the assets of NRG Audrain Generating LLC, or Audrain, to AmerenUE, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation. For purposes of these pro forma statements we have reflected the sale of assets of Audrain as a discontinued operation. The purchase price is $115 million, subject to customary purchase price

adjustments. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2006. The sale is subject to customary approvals, including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Missouri Public Utilities Commission, Illinois Commerce Commission, and Hart-Scott-Rodino review. We expect to record a gain of approximately $15 million at closing.
     On December 27, 2005, NRG entered into purchase and sale agreements for projects co-owned with Dynegy, Inc., or Dynegy, Under the agreements, NRG will acquire Dynegy's 50% ownership interest in WCP (Generation) Holdings, Inc., or WCP, and become the sole owner of WCP's 1,808 MW of generation in Southern CaliforniaIn addition, NRG is selling to Dynegy its 50% ownership interest in Rocky Road Power LLC, or Rocky Road, a 330 MW gas-fueled, simple cycle peaking plant located in Dundee, Illinois. Both of these transactions are conditioned upon one another and NRG will pay Dynegy a net purchase price of $160 million at closing. NRG will fund the net purchase price with cash held by WCP. NRG anticipates closing both transactions during the first quarter 2006.
.
     WCP owns and operates 1,808 MW in Southern California as listed below.
     We have determined that the fair value of our equity investment in Rocky Road is equal to the negotiated price of $45 million. The current carrying value of our investment in Rocky Road is $70.2 million and we therefore expect to record in the fourth quarter of 2005 an other than temporary impairment in our investment. On a pro forma basis the total impairment is in the amount of $25.2 million. As the tax basis of Rocky Road is higher than the consideration received and it is not probable that we can utilize any future benefit from this capital loss, there is no tax expense/(benefit) related to this transaction.
Transactional Pro Forma Analysis:
     The following tables present historical condensed consolidated financial information of (i) NRG for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, (ii) Texas Genco for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, and (iii) the combined company on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.

The combined unaudited pro forma financial data presented below do not purport to represent what the combined company's results of operations would actually have been had the transactions in fact occurred on the dates specified above or to project the combined company's results of operations for any future period.
     The historical consolidated financial information and the unaudited pro forma combined financial information set forth below should be read in conjunction with (a) the consolidated financial statements of NRG Energy, Inc., the related notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation included in NRG Energy, Inc.'s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 as amended by the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 20, 2005, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2005; (b) the consolidated financial statements of Texas Genco LLC and Texas Genco Holdings, Inc., the related notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 filed and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibits 99.01, 99.02 and 99.03 to this current report on Form 8-K/A, as filed with the current report on Form 8-K filed on December 21, 2005 and incorporated herein by reference; and (c) with the financial statements of West Coast Power LLC and the related notes thereto included in NRG Energy, Inc.'s annual report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as found in Exhibit 99.06 to this current report on Form 8-K/A, as filed with the current report on Form 8-K/A filed on January 5, 2006 and incorporated herein by reference.
     The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. As it is difficult to estimate a pro forma allocation of purchase price without completed asset appraisals, we have made a preliminary allocation estimate based on the latest available information. For purposes of these pro forma statements we have assumed that the consideration paid in excess of the historical book value of net assets acquired is related to the step-up in fair value of Texas Genco's emission credit inventory, a step-up in the value of Texas Genco's fixed assets, and an increase in liabilities for assumed out-of-market contracts. Once the Acquisition is closed, the purchase price and allocation may change significantly from the pro forma amounts included herein based on the results of appraisals, changes in market prices, and other analyses, which the Company is obtaining. The other analyses include actuarial studies of employee benefit plans, income tax effects of the Acquisition, analyses of operations to identify assets for disposition and the evaluation of staffing requirements necessary to meet future business needs. Ultimately, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill.

     The following summarizes the estimated pro forma purchase price and allocation impact of the Acquisition on NRG's financial statements at September 30, 2005:
 
Table of Contents
     The WCP Acquisition is a step acquisition as our original equity investment was initiated in a prior period. The purchase price of each acquisition is determined separately per the consideration given at the date of each transaction. Therefore, the purchase price allocation is determined separately based on the fair value for the percentage of net assets acquired at the date of each transaction. The WCP Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated to the percentage of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of the transaction. As it is difficult to estimate a pro forma allocation of purchase price without completed asset appraisals, we have made a preliminary allocation estimate based on the latest available information. For purposes of these pro forma statements we have assumed that the consideration paid below the historical book value of net assets acquired is related to the reduction in fair value of WCP's fixed assets, with an offsetting increase in fair value in WCP's land and an increase in the fair value of WCP's emission credit inventory. Once the WCP Acquisition is closed, the purchase price and allocation may change significantly from the pro forma amounts included herein based on the results of appraisals, changes in market prices and analyses of the income tax effects of the acquisition.
     The following summarizes the estimated pro forma purchase price and allocation impact of the WCP Acquisition on NRG's financial statements at September 30, 2005:
     Per our current valuation of WCP's assets and liabilities, the transaction included an element of an excess over cost, or Negative Goodwill, which has been proportionately allocated to reduce the value of WCP's acquired assets as noted in the table above. Following the proportionate allocation of Negative Goodwill, the incremental increase/(decrease) in value to the acquired assets is as follows:
     We have not associated any deferred taxes to the WCP Acquisition as we believe that the value of the assets and liabilities acquired will be very similar for tax and financial reporting purposes, and any basis differences will only be generated after the closing once timing differences due to depreciation and amortization arise. On a pro forma basis, there are is no basis difference as of September 30, 2005.

Sensitivity Analysis for the final pricing of our common stock:
      To the extent NRG's common stock price is different at the closing of the Acquisition the total value of the shares to be issued to the Sellers will change. The fair value of each share issued to the Sellers is $45.37. This fair value is based on the average NRG share price immediately before and after the pro forma date of closing, or September 30, 2005. A $1.00 change in the price per share of NRG's common stock will impact the fair value of the common stock issued to the Sellers, and consequently the Acquisition purchase price, by approximately $35 million. Any change in our common stock price will also impact our pro forma shareholders equity by the same amount.
Common stock issued to Sellers
      On a pro forma basis, the fair value of the Other Consideration is $368 million. This fair value is equal to the average trading value of 9,038,125 shares of the Company's common stock over a twenty trading day period prior to closing. A $1.00 change in the average trading value of NRG's common stock will impact the amount paid to the Sellers, and consequently the Acquisition purchase price, by approximately $9 million. We have assumed that the Other Consideration will be paid in cash and we intend to use our cash on hand to fund any portion of this cash amount in excess of $368 million.

The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows:
     Due to the lack of asset appraisals and a future closing date, it is very difficult to estimate a pro forma allocation of purchase price. However, for purposes of these pro forma statements, we have assumed that the consideration in excess of the net assets acquired is related to a step-up in the value of Texas Genco's fixed assets, a step-up in the value of Texas Genco's emission credit inventory and

III. Acquisition of WCP and Sale of Rocky Road:
The preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows:
     Per our current valuation of WCP's assets and liabilities, the transaction included an element of an excess over cost, or Negative Goodwill, which has been proportionately allocated to reduce the value of WCP's acquired assets as noted in the table above. Following the proportionate allocation of negative goodwill, the incremental increase/(decrease) in value to the acquired assets is as follows:
     We have not associated any deferred taxes to the WCP Acquisition as we believe that the value of the assets and liabilities acquired will be equal for tax and financial reporting purposes.
     As it is difficult to estimate a pro forma allocation of purchase price without completed asset appraisals, we have made a preliminary allocation estimate based on the latest available information. For purposes of these pro forma statements we have assumed that the consideration paid below the historical book value of net assets acquired is related to the reduction in the fair value of WCP's fixed assets, with an offsetting increase in fair value in WCP's land and an increase in the fair value of WCP's emission credit inventory. Once the WCP Acquisition is closed, the purchase price and allocation may change significantly from the pro forma

amounts included herein based on the results of appraisals, changes in market prices and analyses of the income tax effects of the acquisition.
The allocation of NRG's equity investment's carrying value for 50% of WCP is as follows:
The total reduction in value of WCP's fixed assets is as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2004, our historical equity earnings from WCP have been lower than 50% of WCP's reported net income. As described in Note 13 to our annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 as amended in a current report on Form 8-K filed on December 20, 2005, our investment in WCP reflected an intangible asset with a one year remaining life, consisting of the value of WCP's CDWR energy sales contract that expired on December 31, 2004 and a reduction in the value of WCP's fixed assets that was established when we emerged from bankruptcy on December 6, 2003. NRG's equity earnings were significantly decreased due to the amortization of this intangible asset in the amount of $115.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was slightly offset by the reduction of WCP's depreciation expense in the amount of $31.7 million to reflect the new basis of their fixed assets.
Supplementary information:
 as part of the refinancing part of the new term loan will be subject to adjustable rate of interest. For the year ended December 31, 2004, on a pro forma basis, if the interest rate would increase or decrease by 1/8% for the entire year, income from continuing operations would increase or decrease by $1.2 million, respectively.

It should be noted that for pro forma purposes we have assumed that all the shares issued to the Sellers are newly issued. Per the Acquisition Agreement 19,346,788 shares will be issued from treasury, however, on a pro forma basis that is not possible from January 1, 2004 as there were no shares in treasury. For this reason, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 are also higher than what is expected after the closing of the Acquisition.
