ITEM 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On February 2, 2006, NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG") acquired Texas Genco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Texas Genco"), by purchasing all of the outstanding equity interests in Texas Genco (the "Texas Genco Acquisition"), pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2005 (the "Acquisition Agreement"), by and among NRG, Texas Genco, and each of the direct and indirect owners of Texas Genco parties thereto (the "Sellers"). In connection with the consummation of the Texas Genco Acquisition, NRG entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with the Sellers pursuant to which, among other things, NRG has agreed to file and cause to become effective a shelf registration statement covering resales of the NRG common stock issued to the Sellers in the Texas Genco Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, the Sellers are prohibited from selling any of the securities received in the Texas Genco Acquisition for a period of 180 days after consummation of the Texas Genco Acquisition. Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Sellers also agreed not to acquire additional NRG voting securities or otherwise attempt to acquire control of NRG for a period of two years after the consummation of the transaction.
     The foregoing description of the Investor Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investor Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
ITEM 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On February 2, 2006, NRG consummated the previously announced Texas Genco Acquisition. The final purchase price consisted of approximately $4.4 billion in cash, the assumption of approximately $2.7 billion of Texas Genco debt and the issuance of approximately 35.4 million shares of NRG's common stock.
     The Texas Genco Acquisition was partially funded at closing with the combination of (i) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 20,855,057 shares of NRG's common stock at a price of $48.75 per share; (ii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale of $3.6 billion of unsecured high yield notes; (iii) cash proceeds received upon the issuance and sale in a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock at a price of $250 per share; (iv) funds borrowed under a new senior secured credit facility consisting of a $3.58 billion term loan facility, a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility; and (v) cash on hand.
     Texas Genco owns approximately 11,000 MW of net operating generation capacity, and sells power and related services in Texas' largest power market, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT.
 
     Other than the Acquisition Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby there is no material relationship between NRG and its affiliates and Texas Genco and the Sellers or their affiliates.
     A copy of the Acquisition Agreement was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to NRG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed, with the Commission on October 3, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such seller or underwriter specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or supplement, or a document incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any of the prospective sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or controlling Persons and shall survive the transfer of securities by any seller.

of any judgment without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
               (d) (i) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4.4 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any Claim or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Claim or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in such Claim or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party under this Section 4.4(d) as a result of the Claim and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any action or proceeding.
               (ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 4.4(d)(i). No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
               (e) Indemnification similar to that specified in this Section 4.4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and each seller of Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification of securities under any Law or with any governmental authority other than as required by the Securities Act.
               (f) The obligations of the parties under this Section 4.4 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise have to any other party.
          SECTION 4.5 . The Company agrees that it will use best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and it will take such further action as any Stockholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Stockholder to sell shares of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

It is agreed that no delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party, upon any breach, default or noncompliance by another party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach, default or noncompliance, or any acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach, default or noncompliance thereafter occurring.

Exhibit 99.04
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) today closed its acquisition of Texas Genco LLC providing NRG with both a significant presence in all the key competitive wholesale power markets in the United States and an enhanced overall portfolio of high quality, fuel diverse power generation assets. The Company expects the combination with Texas Genco to generate substantial future earnings and cash flow growth, further strengthening NRG's financial profile.
Princeton, NJ; February 2, 2006;
"In addition to being value enhancing to all stakeholders, we believe this transaction positions NRG to be the premier wholesale energy provider in each of the regions we operate," said David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Furthermore, the fact we were able to complete this transaction in only four months is a testament to the professionalism of both companies' people and is an excellent indicator of what we are confident will be a quick and effective integration."
The final purchase price consisted of $4.4 billion in cash, $2.7 billion in assumed Texas Genco debt and 35.4 million shares of NRG common stock. NRG partially funded the acquisition with the net proceeds from its public offerings of common stock ($1.0 billion), which closed on January 31, 2006, and mandatory convertible preferred stock ($500 million) and unsecured senior notes ($3.6 billion), each of which closed today. In addition, NRG entered into a senior secured credit facility consisting of a $3.58 billion term loan facility, a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion synthetic letter of credit facility.
In conjunction with the acquisition closing, NRG has made two management appointments. Steve Winn, previously the head of mergers and acquisitions for NRG, has been promoted to NRG's Executive Vice President and Regional President, Texas and will run NRG's newest and largest region. Additionally, Thad Hill, previously Executive Vice President of Strategy & Business Development at Texas Genco, has been named Executive Vice President, Corporate Business Development and Strategic Planning for NRG.
With the addition of Texas Genco, NRG currently owns and operates a diverse portfolio of power-generating facilities capable of generating more than 25,000 megawatts of power. The facilities are located primarily in Texas and in the Northeast, South Central and Western regions of the United States. NRG's operations include baseload,
 
intermediate, peaking and cogeneration facilities, thermal energy production and energy resource recovery facilities. NRG also has ownership interests in generating facilities in Australia, Germany and Brazil.
