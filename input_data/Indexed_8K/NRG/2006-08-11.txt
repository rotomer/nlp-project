Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus or any "issuer information" that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, (i) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, not misleading, and (ii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, except in each case insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriter or any Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter or such Selling Stockholder expressly for use therein, which in the case of each Selling Stockholder shall be only the information referred to in Section 2(a)(v).
     (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Selling Stockholder, the directors of the Company and each Selling Stockholder, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) Each Selling Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Underwriter, each other Selling Stockholder, the directors of the Company, the Underwriter and each other Selling Stockholder, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the Underwriter or any other Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity in subsection (a) above from the Company to the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, but only with reference to information relating to such Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company in writing by such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, which, in the case of each Selling Stockholder shall be only the information referred to in Section 2(a)(v).
     (d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant
 
to Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless 1) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or 2) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonably incurred fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b), and by the applicable Selling Stockholder, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(c). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
     (e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the
 
statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares sold by the Selling Stockholders to the Underwriter hereunder shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholders from the Underwriter, on the one hand, and the product of (i) the difference between the closing price of the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date hereof and the price per share paid by the Underwriter and (ii) the number of Shares sold by the Selling Stockholders to the Underwriter hereunder, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, as applicable, on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter or the Selling Shareholders, as applicable, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (f) The Company, the Underwriter and each of the Selling Stockholders, agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(e) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, neither the Underwriter nor any of the Selling Stockholders shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter or Selling Stockholders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any person controlling the Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, the officers or directors of the Company or any person controlling the Company, (iii) any investigation made by or on behalf of a Selling Stockholder or any person controlling a Selling Stockholder or any affiliate of a Selling Stockholder or by or on behalf of the Company, the officers or directors of the Company
 
or any person controlling the Company and (iv) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.

The Underwriter shall not be obligated to close the purchase and sale of any shares pursuant to this Agreement on any date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9.
Termination
     The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement for any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or any Selling Shareholder to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement.

     10. .

No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any Selling Shareholder so defaulting from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
     (b) In the event that such default occurs and the Company and Underwriter agree to proceed with the Offering, then the Underwriter may, or the Company shall have the right, in each case by notice to the other, to postpone the Closing Date be, for a period not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of
 
Underwriter's Counsel, may thereby be made necessary or advisable; and in no event shall the Company be obligated to increase the number of Shares it is required to sell hereunder.
