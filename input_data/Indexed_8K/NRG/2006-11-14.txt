any amendment thereof, not misleading, and (ii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, except in each case insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this section 9 the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
EXECUTION COPY
any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonably incurred fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
EXECUTION COPY
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     (g) In addition to and without limitation or duplication of the Company's obligation to indemnify Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as an Underwriter, the Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Independent Underwriter, its Affiliates and Selling Agents and each person, if any, who controls the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, incurred solely as a result of the Independent Underwriter's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with the offering of the Securities.
 
EXECUTION COPY
If indemnity is sought pursuant to this section 8(g), then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from its own counsel and that of the other indemnified parties for the Independent Underwriter in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of 1934 Act in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances if, in the reasonable judgment of the Independent Underwriter, there may exist a conflict of interest between the Independent Underwriter and the other indemnified parties. Any such separate counsel for the Independent Underwriter and such control persons of the Independent Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Independent Underwriter.
     9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the Representatives judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.

If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

8. Indemnity and Contribution.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, each Selling Stockholder, and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of the Underwriter or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act (provided that the Company's indemnification obligation shall not extend to any free writing prospectus required to be filed by the Company due to the Underwriter's breach of the covenants set forth in Section 8), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the preliminary prospectus, if any, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus or any "issuer information" that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
 
statements therein, (i) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, not misleading, and (ii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (if the Company furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, except in each case insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriter or any Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter or such Selling Stockholder expressly for use therein, which in the case of each Selling Stockholder shall be only the information referred to in Section 2(a)(v).
     (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Selling Stockholder, the directors of the Company and each Selling Stockholder, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) Each Selling Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Underwriter, each other Selling Stockholder, the directors of the Company, the Underwriter and each other Selling Stockholder, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the Underwriter or any other Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity in subsection (a) above from the Company to the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, but only with reference to information relating to such Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company in writing by such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, which, in the case of each Selling Stockholder shall be only the information referred to in Section 2(a)(v).
     (d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
pursuant to this Section 8 the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless 1) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or 2) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such reasonably incurred fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b), and by the applicable Selling Stockholder, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(c). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares sold by the Selling Stockholders to the Underwriter hereunder shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the
 
net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholders from the Underwriter, on the one hand, and the product of (i) the difference between the closing price of the Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date hereof and the price per share paid by the Underwriter and (ii) the number of Shares sold by the Selling Stockholders to the Underwriter hereunder, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter and the Selling Stockholders, as applicable, on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter or the Selling Shareholders, as applicable, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (f) The Company, the Underwriter and each of the Selling Stockholders, agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(e) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, neither the Underwriter nor any of the Selling Stockholders shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter or Selling Stockholders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     (g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any person controlling the Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, the officers or directors of the Company or any person controlling the Company, (iii) any investigation made by or on behalf of a Selling Stockholder or any person controlling a Selling Stockholder or any affiliate of a Selling Stockholder or by or on behalf of the Company, the officers or directors of the Company or any person controlling the Company and (iv) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
     . The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement at any time by notice to the Company and each Selling Stockholder if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to any Sale Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in the securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the Underwriter's judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the Underwriter's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus. The Underwriter shall not be obligated to close the purchase and sale of any shares pursuant to this Agreement on any date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9.
9. Termination
     The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement for any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or any Selling Shareholder to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriter because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company or any Selling Shareholder to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel, but without duplication of any reimbursement obligation pursuant to any other agreement) reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     .
10. Selling Stockholder Default
     (a) If any Selling Shareholder shall default in its or their obligation to sell and deliver any Shares hereunder, then the Underwriter may, by notice to the Company, terminate this Agreement without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party except that the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 11 and 16 hereof shall remain in full force and effect. No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any Selling Shareholder so defaulting from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
     (b) In the event that such default occurs and the Company and Underwriter agree to proceed with the Offering, then the Underwriter may, or the Company shall have the right, in each case by notice to the other, to postpone the Closing Date be, for a period not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of Underwriter's Counsel, may thereby be made necessary or advisable; and in no event shall the Company be obligated to increase the number of Shares it is required to sell hereunder.
 
     . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
11. Effectiveness
     This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from the Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign solely by reason of such purchase.
