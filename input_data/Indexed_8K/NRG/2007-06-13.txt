Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On June 8, 2007, NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG") completed the $4.4 billion refinancing of its senior credit facility previously announced on May 2, 2007. This transaction resulted in a 25 basis points reduction in the first lien pricing grid, a $200 million reduction in the synthetic letter of credit (LC) facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide improved flexibility and efficiency for returning capital to shareholders and asset repowering and investment opportunities (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). The pricing of the Term B and LC facilities is now LIBOR + 175 basis points with further reductions available upon the achievement of certain financial ratios.
     On June 8, 2007, NRG Holdings, Inc. ("NRG Holdings"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the "Holdings Senior Credit Facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions, including Credit Suisse, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and Credit Suisse and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers providing for up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion, consisting of a senior secured term loan facility. Once certain regulatory approvals are obtained, NRG may elect to implement a holding company structure under which NRG would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG Holdings. At the same time, NRG Holdings may draw upon the Holdings Senior Credit Facility and use the proceeds to pay down NRG Term B debt.
     The material terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Holdings Senior Credit Facility are described below.
     
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
     Under NRG's refinanced senior credit facility, NRG, at its option, can move $1 billion of the Term B debt to the Holdings Senior Credit Facility. Use of the net proceeds from the Holdings Senior Credit Facility to pay down the NRG Term B debt will expand NRG's restricted payments capacity under its senior unsecured notes by the same amount. When funded, the Holdings Senior Credit Facility will price 75 basis points wider than NRG's existing senior secured facility.
     The amendments to NRG's existing senior credit facilities entered into as part of the refinancing include, among others, amendments that:
     A copy of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The description of the material terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.
 
     
Holdings Senior Credit Facility
     If drawn on, the Holdings Senior Credit Facility will mature on June 8, 2014 and will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount with the balance payable on the seventh anniversary thereof. The Holdings Senior Credit Facility is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of NRG Holdings, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions. No assets of NRG or its subsidiaries secure the Holdings Senior Credit Facility.
     The Holdings Senior Credit Facility contains customary covenants, which, among other things limit NRG Holdings' ability to: incur indebtedness and liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; make investments, loans and advances; engage in mergers, acquisitions consolidations and asset sales; pay dividends and other restricted payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; engage in business activities and hedging transactions; make capital expenditures; make debt payments; make certain changes to the terms of material indebtedness; and other covenants customary for such facilities. The Holdings Senior Credit Facility has not been drawn on, but may be drawn on in one draw once regulatory approvals have been obtained. The proceeds may only be used to pay down the Term B debt.
     A copy of the credit agreement governing the Holdings Senior Credit Facility is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The description of the material terms of the credit agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant

The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.23(e) prior to the time that any Revolving Credit Lender makes any payment pursuant to this paragraph; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear.

Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances

     (ii) impose on any Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Deposit Bank or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein or any Credit-Linked Deposit (except, in each case, any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate),

     (b)   If any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans purchased by, such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank to a level below that which such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's, the Administrative Agent's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

     SECTION 2.15.   . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower (which notice shall include documentation or information in reasonable detail supporting the conclusions in such notice) and to the Administrative Agent:
Change in Legality
     (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
     (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans. Any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan under (i) above shall be subject to Section 2.16.
     (b)   For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.
     SECTION 2.16.   . The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Deposit Bank against any loss or expense that such Lender or the Deposit Bank may sustain or incur as a
Indemnity
 
consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender or the Deposit Bank in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (iii) any Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder, (iv) the default by the Borrower in making any reduction or conversion of any Credit-Linked Deposits after notice thereof shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder or (v) the reduction or conversion of any Credit-Linked Deposits on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto or the Scheduled Investment Termination Date with respect thereto (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a "") or (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment required to be made hereunder. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include, in the case of a Lender, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Loan or Credit-Linked Deposit that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan or Credit-Linked Deposit, as the case may be, over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender or the Deposit Bank, as the case may be, setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender or the Deposit Bank believes it is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, including the calculations and criteria applied to determine such amount or amounts, and other documentation or information reasonably supporting the conclusions in such certificate, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding.
Breakage Event
     SECTION 2.17.   . Except as provided below in this Section 2.17 with respect to Swingline Loans and as required under Section 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 2.20, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of reimbursement obligations, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each reduction of the Term Loan Commitments, the Total Credit-Linked Deposit or the Revolving Credit Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans and/or Credit-Linked Deposits). For purposes of determining the available Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at any time, each outstanding Swingline Loan shall be deemed to have utilized the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which shall not have made Swingline Loans) pro rata in accordance with such respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.

Sharing of Setoffs
 
Disbursement as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans and L/C Exposure of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and L/C Exposure and participations in Loans and L/C Exposure held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans and L/C Exposure prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; , however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan or L/C Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

The Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender any payment received on such Lender's behalf promptly after the Administrative Agent's receipt of such payment. All payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in dollars.
Payments
     (b)   Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.
     SECTION 2.20.   . (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall be required to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions and

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability shall be delivered to the Borrower by the Deposit Bank or a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of the Deposit Bank or a Lender, promptly upon such party's determination of an indemnifiable event and such certificate shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error; that the failure to deliver such certificate shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.20(c) except to the extent the Borrower is actually prejudiced thereby. Payment under this Section 2.20(c) shall be made within 15 days from the date of delivery of such certificate; that the Borrower shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Deposit Bank or the Lender (as the case may be) in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if and to the extent that such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, the Deposit Bank or such Lender or to the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Deposit Bank or a Lender to deliver a timely certificate as to the amount of an indemnifiable liability.

provided
     In addition, each Foreign Lender shall (i) furnish on or before it becomes a party to this Agreement either (a) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or (b) an accurate and complete U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), certifying, in either case, to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to an exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (ii) provide a new Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder; provided that any Foreign Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and is relying on the so-called "portfolio interest exemption" shall also furnish a "Non-Bank Certificate" in the form of Exhibit I together with a Form W-8BEN (or successor form). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.

     SECTION 2.23.   . (a) . On the Closing Date, the Existing Letters of Credit were automatically, without any action on the part of any Person, deemed to be Funded Letters of Credit or Revolving Letters of Credit, as indicated on Schedule 1.01(d), issued hereunder for the account of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, (i) the Issuing Bank agrees to issue, upon the Borrower's request, a Revolving Letter of Credit in such form as may be reasonably approved from time to time by the Issuing Bank at any time and from time to time while the Revolving Credit Commitments remain in effect, and (ii) the Issuing Bank agrees to issue, upon the Borrower's request, a Funded Letter of Credit in such form as may be reasonably approved from time to time by the Issuing Bank at any time and from time to time during the Funded Letter of Credit Availability Period, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), for the Borrower's account or for the account of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors or for the account of any other Subsidiary or any Minority Investment; that if such Letter of Credit is being issued for the account of a Subsidiary Guarantor or other Subsidiary, the Borrower and such Subsidiary Guarantor or such other Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall be co-applicants with respect to such Letter of Credit. This Section shall not be construed to impose an obligation upon the Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Letters of Credit
General
provided
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Bank is under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if at the time of such issuance:
     (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect with respect to such Issuing Bank on the Closing Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable or in
 
effect with respect to such Issuing Bank as of the Closing Date and which such Issuing Bank reasonably and in good faith deems material to it; or
     (ii) such Issuing Bank shall have received from the Borrower or the Administrative Agent prior to the issuance of such Letter of Credit notice that the issuance of such Letter of Credit is not permitted under this Agreement.
     (b)   . In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or to amend, renew or extend an existing Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or fax or electronic communication to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (no less than three Business Days (or such shorter period of time acceptable to the Issuing Bank) in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, whether such Letter of Credit shall be a Funded Letter of Credit or a Revolving Letter of Credit, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) below), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be reasonably necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount and expiry date of each Letter of Credit issued by it and (ii) provide a copy of such Letter of Credit (and any amendments, renewals or extensions thereof) to the Administrative Agent. A Funded Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each such Funded Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension the Funded L/C Exposure shall not exceed the Total Credit-Linked Deposit and that the other conditions expressly set forth herein are satisfied in respect thereto. A Revolving Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each such Revolving Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment and that the other conditions expressly set forth herein are satisfied in respect thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Revolving Letter of Credit Exposure in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit issued by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed $300,000,000 at any time outstanding without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch shall have no obligation to issue a Revolving Letter of Credit if the foregoing limitation would be exceeded. If the Borrower shall fail to specify whether any requested Letter of Credit is to be a Funded Letter of Credit or a Revolving Letter of Credit, then the requested Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a Funded Letter of Credit unless the issuance thereof would result in the Funded L/C Exposure exceeding the Total Credit-Linked Deposit at such time, in which case it shall be deemed to be a Revolving Letter of Credit, but only if the issuance of a Revolving Letter of Credit is permissible at such time as described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuance of Funded Letters of Credit shall also be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.23(e) below.
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
     (c)   . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (ii)(A) in the case of any Revolving Letter of Credit, the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and (B) in the case of any Funded Letter of Credit, the date that is five Business Days prior to the Funded Letter of Credit Maturity Date, unless such Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date; , , that a Letter of Credit may, upon the request of the Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be

renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of 12 months or less (but not beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to, in the case of any Revolving Letter of Credit, the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or, in the case of any Funded Letter of Credit, the Funded Letter of Credit Maturity Date) unless the Issuing Bank notifies the beneficiary thereof at least 30 days (or within such longer period as specified in such Letter of Credit) prior to the then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed.
     (d)   . By the issuance of a Revolving Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each Revolving L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower (or, if applicable, another party pursuant to its obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date due as provided in Section 2.02(f). Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations
     On the Closing Date, without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank granted to each Original Funded L/C Lender, and each such Lender acquired from the Issuing Bank, a participation in each Funded Letter of Credit (including each Existing Letter of Credit) equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. The aggregate purchase price for the participations of each Original Funded L/C Lender in Funded Letters of Credit was equal to the amount of the Credit-Linked Deposit of such Lender. Each Original Funded L/C Lender paid to the Administrative Agent for payment to the Deposit Bank its Credit-Linked Deposit in full on the Closing Date. On the First Restatement Date, without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby granted to each New Funded L/C Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquired from the Issuing Bank, a participation in each Funded Letter of Credit (including each Existing Letter of Credit) equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. The aggregate purchase price for the participations of each New Funded L/C Lender in Funded Letters of Credit was equal to the amount of the Credit-Linked Deposit of such Lender. Each New Funded L/C Lender paid to the Administrative Agent for payment to the Deposit Bank its Credit-Linked Deposit in full on the First Restatement Date. Each Funded L/C Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees that if the Issuing Bank makes a Funded L/C Disbursement which is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.23(e), the Deposit Bank shall reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of such Funded L/C Disbursement, ratably as among the Funded L/C Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages of the Total Credit-Linked Deposit, from such Funded L/C Lender's Credit-Linked Deposit on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account. Each Funded L/C Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire and fund participations in respect of Funded Letters of Credit pursuant to this paragraph is unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the return of the Credit-Linked Deposits, and that such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, each Funded L/C Lender
 
irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank to apply amounts of its Credit-Linked Deposit as provided in this paragraph.
     Notwithstanding the intention of the parties that each Funded L/C Lender shall have purchased its participation in Funded Letters of Credit on the Closing Date or on the First Restatement Date, as applicable, in further consideration for the agreements of the Issuing Bank and the Deposit Bank hereunder, each Funded L/C Lender hereby grants to the Deposit Bank for the benefit of the Issuing Bank a security interest and right of offset with respect to its Credit-Linked Deposit and all investments thereof and all proceeds of any of the foregoing to secure such Funded L/C Lender's obligation to acquire and fund participations in respect of Funded Letters of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.23(d) and each Funded L/C Lender irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank to apply amounts of its Credit-Linked Deposit in accordance with this Section 2.23(d). Each Funded L/C Lender further acknowledges and agrees that each Credit-Linked Deposit will be established in the name of the Deposit Bank and will be subject to the sole dominion and control of the Deposit Bank.
     (e)   . If the Issuing Bank shall make any Revolving L/C Disbursement in respect of a Revolving Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such Revolving L/C Disbursement not later than two hours after the Borrower shall have received notice from the Issuing Bank that payment of such draft will be made, or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day.
Reimbursement
     If the Issuing Bank shall make any Funded L/C Disbursement in respect of a Funded Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall have the right (but not the obligation) to pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the entire amount of such Funded L/C Disbursement not later than two hours after the Borrower shall have received notice from the Issuing Bank that payment of such draft will be made or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day; that the Borrower may not elect to make such reimbursement at any time after the 91 day immediately preceding the Funded Letter of Credit Maturity Date. If the Borrower does not so reimburse the Issuing Bank for such Funded L/C Disbursement, reimbursement of the Issuing Bank shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02(f). In the event that the Borrower elects to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any Funded L/C Disbursement, for a period of 91 days following such reimbursement payment by the Borrower, the Funded L/C Exposure shall be deemed to include for all purposes hereunder (including for purposes of the issuance of any new Funded Letter of Credit during such period) the amount of such reimbursement payment until the end of such 91-day period.
provided

     (f)   . The Borrower's obligations to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:
Obligations Absolute
     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;
     (ii) any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document;
 
     (iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, the Borrower, any subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction;
     (iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
     (v) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
     (vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Bank, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.
     (g)   . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. The

Such deposit shall be held, upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower with respect to Letters of Credit under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in Cash Equivalents, which investments shall be made by the Administrative Agent in accordance with its internal policies applied to transactions of the size and nature provided for in the Loan Documents, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and/or termination of the Commitments, moneys in such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the L/C Exposure at such time and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Credit Lenders and Funded L/C Lenders with L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and/or termination of the Commitments, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all such Events of Default have been cured or waived.
     (k)   . The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of the Agreement. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be an "Issuing Bank" (in addition to being a Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Lender.

     (d)   Subject to the Borrower's compliance with the cash-collateralization requirements set forth in Section 2.09(a), the Deposit Bank shall return any remaining Credit-Linked Deposits to the Administrative Agent for payment to the Funded L/C Lenders on a pro rata basis following the occurrence of the Funded Letter of Credit Maturity Date.

     (ii) if, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of Sections 6.13 and 6.14, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of Sections 6.13 and 6.14 as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of Sections 6.13 and 6.14 that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement.

Agents
     Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
 
     No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as in Section 9.08), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as any Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08), in each case, in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
provided
     Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
     Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject to the Borrower's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of
 
any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.

     Each of the Syndication Agent and each Arranger, in its capacity as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Arrangers, or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
     To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

Eurodollar Term Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Term Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower (which notice shall include documentation or information in reasonable detail supporting the conclusions in such notice) and to the Administrative Agent:
     (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Term Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Term Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Term Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Term Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Term Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Term Loan into an ABR Term Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
     (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Term Loans made by it be converted to ABR Term Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Term Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Term Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Term Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Term Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Term Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Term Loans. Any such conversion of a Eurodollar Term Loan under (i) above shall be subject to Section 2.16.
     (b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Term Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Term Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.
     SECTION 2.16. . The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar Term Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Term Loan to an ABR Term Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Term Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor or (iii) any Eurodollar Term Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Term Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Term Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder, (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a "") or (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment required to be made hereunder. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include, in the case of a Lender, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Term Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Term Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender believes it is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, including the calculations and criteria applied to determine such amount or amounts, and other
Indemnity

documentation or information reasonably supporting the conclusions in such certificate, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding.
     SECTION 2.17. . Except as required under Section 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 2.20, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Term Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each reduction of the Term Loan Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Term Loan Commitments (or, if such Term Loan Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Term Loans). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.
Pro Rata Treatment
     SECTION 2.18. . Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Term Loan as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Term Loans shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Term Loans of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Term Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans and participations in Term Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Term Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its Term Loans prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; , however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Term Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Term Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Setoffs
provided
     SECTION 2.19. . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Each such payment (other than payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.16 or 2.20, which at the election of the Borrower may be made directly to the Lender claiming the benefit of any such Sections) shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or as otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent). The Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender any payment received on such Lender's behalf promptly after the Administrative Agent's receipt of such payment. All payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in dollars .
Payments
     (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other
 
Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.
     SECTION 2.20. . (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions and withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make (or cause to be made) such deductions and withholdings and (iii) the Borrower shall pay (or cause to be paid) the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. In addition, the Borrower hereunder shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Other Taxes imposed other than by deduction or withholding to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (b) [Reserved].
     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, or such Lender, as the case may be, or any of their respective Affiliates, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Government Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability shall be delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of a Lender, promptly upon such party's determination of an indemnifiable event and such certificate shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error; that the failure to deliver such certificate shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.20(c) except to the extent the Borrower is actually prejudiced thereby. Payment under this Section 2.20(c) shall be made within 15 days from the date of delivery of such certificate; that the Borrower shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the Administrative Agent, or the Lender (as the case may be) in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if and to the extent that such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, or such Lender or to the failure of the Administrative Agent, or a Lender to deliver a timely certificate as to the amount of an indemnifiable liability.
provided
provided
     (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, and in any event within 60 days of such payment being due, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the reasonable written request of the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
 
withholding or at a reduced rate; that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or delivery would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
provided
     In addition, each Foreign Lender shall (i) furnish on or before it becomes a party to this Agreement either (a) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or (b) an accurate and complete U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), certifying, in either case, to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to an exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (ii) provide a new Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder; provided that any Foreign Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and is relying on the so-called "portfolio interest exemption" shall also furnish a "Non-Bank Certificate" in the form of Exhibit I together with a Form W-8BEN (or successor form). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.
     (f) Any Lender that is a United States person, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code, and is not an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6049-4(c) shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor form that such person is entitled to provide at such time in order to comply with United States back-up withholding requirements.
     (g) For purposes of this Section 2.20, in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by such Lender with respect to payments made by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be treated as Taxes required to be deducted by the Borrower, but only to the extent such Taxes would have been required to be deducted and withheld by the Lender if it were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes making such payments under the Loan Documents on behalf of the Borrower and Excluded Taxes were defined by reference to the partner (treating the partner as a Foreign Lender) to whom payments are made.
     (h) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of all amounts due hereunder.
     SECTION 2.21. . (a) In the event (i) any Lender delivers a certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender delivers a notice described in Section 2.15 or (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.20, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 9.04(b)), upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to transfer and assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, (y) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such filing or assignment, delegation and transfer.

     Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject to the Borrower's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent.
     Each of the Syndication Agent and each Arranger, in its capacity as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
 
shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
     To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) has completed the $4.4 billion refinancing of its senior credit facility previously announced on May 2, 2007. This transaction resulted in a 25 basis points reduction in the first lien pricing grid, a $200 million reduction in the synthetic letter of credit (LC) facility to $1.3 billion, and various amendments to provide improved flexibility and efficiency for returning capital to shareholders and asset repowering and investment opportunities. The pricing of the Term B and LC facilities is now LIBOR + 175 basis points with further reductions available upon the achievement of certain financial ratios.
Princeton, NJ; (June 11, 2007)
On May 2, 2007, the Company also disclosed its intent to form a holding company (Holdco) later in 2007. Under the refinanced credit facility, the Company, at its option, can move $1 billion of the Term B debt to a new senior credit facility at Holdco, which was entered into June 8 as part of the refinancing transaction.
