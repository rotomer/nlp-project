PRINCETON, NJ; September 17, 2008
"In this extraordinary financial environment, and given the response to the exchange offer so far, it is clear that now is not the ideal time for bondholders to give proper consideration to the merits of our offer," said David Crane, President and CEO, NRG Energy, Inc. "We remain committed both to fulfilling the Company's previously stated objectives in terms of the return of capital to shareholders within the current constraints of our indenture and to finding ways to ease those constraints in a manner that is value enhancing to our shareholders and bondholders alike."
This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The exchange offers and consent solicitations, which were only available to eligible holders, were made solely pursuant to the Offering Circular and Consent Solicitation Statement dated September 4, 2008.
