FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Full-Year 2008 Financial Highlights:
Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights:
Full-Year 2008 Growth Initiative Highlights:
2009 Outlook and Growth Highlights:
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) today reported income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 of $273 million, or $0.98 per diluted common share, compared to income of $100 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2007. Driving the increase in fourth quarter 2008 income was an after tax benefit of $200 million in unrealized mark-to-market (MtM) gains as a result of falling commodity prices, while fourth quarter 2007 results included an after tax charge of $22 million in unrealized MtM losses.
PRINCETON, NJ; February 12, 2009
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported record income from continuing operations of $1,016 million, or $3.66 per diluted common share, compared to 2007 income from continuing operations of $569 million, or $1.95 per share. The increase was due primarily to a $361 million increase in net after tax MtM gains as such gains were $315 million in 2008 versus MtM losses of $46 million in 2007. Financial results for 2008 were favorably impacted by both strong plant operating performance and a proactive commercial operations strategy implemented during the second quarter of the year. Further benefitting 2008 results was a $33 million after tax reduction in development expenses resulting from the capitalization of STP units 3&4 costs starting on January 1, 2008, following the docketing of the Company's Combined Construction and Operating License Application.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,188 million, or $4.29 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $586 million, or $2.01 per diluted common share, for the same period last year. The full year 2008 results included $172 million in income, or $0.63 per diluted common share from
 
discontinued operations including a $164 million after tax gain from the sale of Itiquira Energetica S.A. (ITISA), which was sold in April 2008.
Cash flow from operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2008 was $1,434 million compared to $1,517 million for the previous year. After adjusting for cash collateral outflows of $417 million in 2008 and $125 million of out flows in 2007, cash from operations actually rose 13%, or $209 million, to $1,851 million in 2008, compared to $1,642 million in 2007.
"The Company completed 2008 by setting records on almost all financial metrics including net income, adjusted EBITDA and liquidity, and these were achieved during the most challenging business environment seen in a generation," commented David Crane, NRG President and Chief Executive Officer. "The financial success in 2008 was equally matched by record operating performance at our plants including our best ever safety performance achieved across our entire fleet."

MtM Impacts of Hedging and Trading Activities
The Company, in the normal course of business, enters into contracts to lock in forward prices for a significant portion of its expected power generation and risk management activities. Although these transactions are predominantly economic hedges of our portfolio, a portion of these forward sales are not afforded hedge accounting treatment and the MtM change in value of these transactions is recorded to current period earnings. NRG also hedges power prices using natural gas contracts and, to the extent gas and power prices do not fully meet correlation tests, this ineffectiveness is also reflected in our MtM results. For
 
the fourth quarter 2008, NRG incurred $365 million of forward domestic net MtM gains accompanied by a $1 million gain on hedge ineffectiveness compared to the fourth quarter 2007 when we recorded a $2 million forward net MtM loss accompanied by an $18 million loss on hedge ineffectiveness. For the full year 2008, NRG recognized $536 million of net forward MtM gains and a $25 million hedge ineffectiveness loss compared to the full year 2007 when the Company recorded $20 million of MtM gains along with a $13 million hedge ineffectiveness gain. MtM gains in 2008 were driven primarily by the downward trend in natural gas prices during the second half of the year.
Table 2: Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations, Excluding MtM Impacts
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2008 for the region was $270 million, a $77 million reduction compared to the same period in 2007. Net energy margins declined by $33 million as a 31-day refueling outage at STP, together with lower power prices year-over-year, negatively impacted results. Operating expenses increased by $14 million as higher employment in the region increased labor and benefit costs by $6 million and asset retirement and disposal costs increased $8 million. Development expenses increased $23 million in the fourth quarter 2008 versus 2007 as the prior year's quarter included a $39 million reimbursement of development expenses by the Company's partner for the STP 3&4 repowering project.
Texas:
Annual adjusted EBITDA for 2008 was $1,543 million, a $159 million increase over 2007. Net energy margins increased $144 million as higher power prices, particularly during the second quarter of the year, more than offset a 2% reduction in fleetwide generation. Coal generation increased 1% compared to 2007 as the Limestone facility set a plant record of just under 13.9 million MWhrs produced and net capacity factor of 94%. These results, however, were offset by a 3% reduction in nuclear generation due to a second refueling outage at STP and a 14% decrease in gas plant generation resulting from lower market heat rates during the fourth quarter. Operating costs rose by $32 million during 2008 as higher headcount increased labor and benefit costs by $14 million, and the retirement and disposal of assets added an additional $16 million in expenses. Higher operating costs were more than offset by a $59 million reduction in development expenses, primarily due to the capitalization of STP units 3&4 costs in 2008 versus expensing those costs in 2007.
Fourth quarter 2008 regional adjusted EBITDA was $92 million, a decrease of $21 million as compared to the same quarter last year. Net energy margins were down $9 million mainly due to declining power prices and market heat rates partially offset by fuel-related risk management activities. Capacity revenues also declined by $13 million as New York in-city capacity prices fell year-over-year and capacity
Northeast:
 
payments were lower at the Company's Norwalk Harbor plant under its reliability-must-run (RMR) agreement.
Full-year 2008 adjusted EBITDA decreased $99 million over the prior year to $475 million. Despite flat baseload generation, total generation declined by 6%, or 814,000 MWhrs, from 2007 levels as gas- and oil-fueled units ran less than in 2007. Generation at Arthur Kill declined 205,000 MWhrs as congestion support provided in 2007 was not as prevalent in 2008. In addition to lower generation, energy margins were negatively impacted by $83 million due to rising fuel costs and an additional $38 million due to the expiry of certain load contracts and higher costs to serve remaining contracts. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was a $14 million increase in capacity revenues as a $20 million increase in PJM Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) capacity revenues and a $12 million increase in the Norwalk RMR capacity payments more than offset an $18 million reduction in New York capacity revenues resulting from new in-city capacity mitigation rules. Further offsetting these unfavorable variances were $7 million in higher emission credit sales, a $10 million reduction in operating and maintenance expenses due to reduced scope of outages during 2008, a $10 million reduction in property taxes, and $6 million in lower general and administrative costs mainly associated with lower insurance costs.
Fourth quarter 2008 South Central adjusted EBITDA rose $13 million to $17 million. Merchant energy revenues were higher by $23 million on a 219,000 MWhr increase in sales volumes while contracted energy revenues were lower by $4 million on lower volumes. The increased merchant energy revenues were partially offset by $14 million in higher coal, gas and transmission costs. Operating expenses were lower by $6 million mainly attributable to lower maintenance expenses from a reduced scope of work on outages.
South Central:
On a full year basis, adjusted EBITDA rose $44 million in 2008 to $145 million. Big Cajun II plant performance, with an 84% net capacity factor, drove a 2% increase in generation. Merchant sales increased by 571,000 MWhrs helping to lift energy margins by $19 million. Capacity revenues rose $12 million due to higher billing peaks related to capacity under the cooperative sales agreements, while operating costs were lower by $10 million primarily due to fewer outages.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA rose $4 million in 2008 to $17 million over 2007 largely due to lower operating expenses. On a full-year basis, adjusted EBITDA improved by $27 million over 2007 to $68 million due to a number of factors including a $5 million increase in sales of emission credits, a $3 million increase in capacity revenues, a $4 million increase in energy margins from El Segundo, a $6 million improvement in operating expenses and a $5 million reduction in development expenses.
West:
: With the reclassification of ITISA to discontinued operations in 2007 and its subsequent sale in 2008, only our German and Australian investments comprised this segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA declined $19 million in 2008 to $10 million due to a $5 million reduction in equity earnings from MIBRAG due to higher carbon emission costs, a $2 million reduction in equity earnings at Gladstone due to lower generation and lower capacity and a $3 million reduction in Schkopau capacity revenues. Full year 2008 adjusted EBITDA was down $11 million over 2007 to $82 million due to a $2 million reduction in energy margins at Schkopau, and a $5 million decline in equity earnings from MIBRAG related to higher carbon costs.
International
The Thermal business is largely contracted resulting in relatively consistent performance between the periods presented. On a full-year basis, however, adjusted EBITDA was down $7 million versus 2007 largely due to the closure of the Rock Tenn facility, the effect of which was partially offset by increased capacity revenues for Thermal's Dover and Paxton generating units that participate in PJM's RPM capacity market which started in June 2007.
Thermal:
 
Full-year 2008 adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $50 million or $62 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was due to a $23 million decline in interest income on investable funds, a $10 million increase in development spending, a $12 million increase in an impairment of a distressed investment in commercial paper, a $6 million increase in general and administrative costs, and an $8 million reduction in other revenues primarily due to lower emissions sales.
Corporate:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Table 3: Corporate Liquidity
Liquidity at December 31, 2008 was a record $3,364 million, including $1,504 million in cash, net of funds deposited as collateral by hedge counterparties, and $1,860 million in letter of credit (LC) and Revolver availability. This compares to year-end 2007 with cash balances of $1,161 million and $1,554 million in LC and Revolver availability. The $343 million increase in cash balances net of funds deposited as collateral by hedge counterparties is attributable to internally generated cash flow during 2008 and $255 million in cash proceeds from sale of assets, primarily ITISA, during the second quarter. The $306 million increase in LC and Revolver availability resulted from $231 million in LC's being returned as hedging counterparties migrated from NRG's second-lien structure to a first-lien position and an additional $75 million reduction due to lower commodity prices.
Funds deposited by counterparties consist of cash received from hedge counterparties in support of energy risk management activities and it is the Company's intention to limit the use of these funds. Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, NRG will refund these funds to the hedge counterparties as the underlying positions settle.
Capital Allocation Plan
NRG's strong cash generation during 2008 allowed the Company to make significant progress on, and internally fund, its 2008 Capital Allocation Plan. This included $899 million in capital investments in the business together with the $84 million equity investment in Sherbino. At the same time, the Company funded $234 million in debt repayments, $55 million in preferred dividends, and $185 million in share repurchases bringing total share repurchases under the 2008 share repurchase plan to $270 million. The Company remains committed to fulfilling its previously announced $300 million share repurchase plan under its 2009 Capital Allocation Program but is unable to predict if or when it will be able to implement the 2009 Program as a result of restrictions under the United States securities laws.

NRG
NRG 1.0 exceeded its financial goal of $250 million of recurring and one-time pretax income benefits during 2008. Beginning in January 2009, the Company transitioned to NRG 2.0 targeting an incremental 100 basis point improvement to the Company's return on invested capital by 2012 as measured by $150 million of free cash flow assuming no asset sales. The economic results of NRG 2.0 will focus

EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow should not be construed as an inference that NRG's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
 
Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG's business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for discontinued operations, gains on sale of equity method investments and other assets; factors which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding mark-to-market (MtM) adjustments, is provided to further supplement adjusted EBITDA by excluding the impact of unrealized MtM adjustments included in EBITDA for hedge contracts that are economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with SFAS No. 133 as well as the ineffectiveness impact of economic hedge contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding MtM adjustments, is a supplemental measure provided to illustrate the impact of MtM movements on adjusted EBITDA resulting from commodity price movements for economic hedge contracts while the underlying hedged commodity has not been subject to MtM adjustments.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and preferred stock dividends and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating free cash flow, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release. Free cash flow improvements targeted under our NRG program are expected to result in increased cash provided by operations or reduced cash used in investing activities, and a reconciliation to such measures is not accessible on a forward looking basis.
