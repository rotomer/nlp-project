Item 8.01 Other Events.
On February 20, 2009, NRG Common Stock Finance I LLC ("CSF I") and NRG Common Stock Finance II LLC ("CSF II" and together with CSF I, "CSF I and II"), wholly-owned subsidiaries of NRG Energy, Inc. (the "Company") entered into Share Lending Agreements with affiliates of Credit Suisse relating to the shares of NRG common stock currently held by CSF I and II in connection with the previously executed Note Purchase Agreement and Preferred Interest Agreements, by and between CSF I and II and affiliates of Credit Suisse (the "Financing Arrangements"). Due to the current lack of liquidity in the stock borrow market for NRG shares and in order to maintain the intended economic benefits of the Financing Arrangements, CSF I and II have lent affiliates of Credit Suisse 8,500,000 shares of the 21,970,903 shares of NRG common stock currently held by CSF I and II. The Share Lending Agreements permit affiliates of Credit Suisse to borrow up to the total number of shares of NRG Common Stock held by affiliates CSF I and II . Shares borrowed by affiliates of Credit Suisse under the Share Lending Agreements will be used to replace shares borrowed by affiliates of Credit Suisse from third parties in connection with Credit Suisse's hedging activities related to the Financing Arrangements. The shares are expected to be returned upon the termination of the Financing Arrangements. Until the shares are returned, the shares will be treated as outstanding for corporate law purposes, but will not be added to the Company's fully diluted share count for financial reporting purposes.
