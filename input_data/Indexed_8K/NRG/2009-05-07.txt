          11.08. . It is not necessary for any Merrill Party to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Reimbursement Guarantor or REPS or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf of any of them.

Any Reimbursement Guarantee may be made to REPS or continued from time to time, without notice to or authorization from any Reimbursement Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of REPS at the time of any such grant or continuation. No Merrill Party shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with any Reimbursement Guarantor its assessment, or any Reimbursement Guarantor's assessment, of the financial condition of REPS. Each Reimbursement Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from REPS on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of REPS and its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents, and each Reimbursement Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of REPS and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Reimbursement Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Merrill Party to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of REPS now known or hereafter known by any Merrill Party.

The obligations of Reimbursement Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired, discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of REPS or any other Reimbursement Guarantor or by any defense which REPS or any other Reimbursement Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
          (b) Each Reimbursement Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of Reimbursement Guarantors and Merrill Parties that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by Reimbursement Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve REPS of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations. Reimbursement Guarantors will permit any trustee in
 
bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the Merrill Parties, or allow the claim of the Merrill Parties in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced.
          (c) In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid by REPS, the obligations of Reimbursement Guarantors hereunder shall continue and remain full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Merrill Party as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder.

To Amended and Restated Credit Sleeve and Reimbursement Agreement Calculations Relating to Exchange Traded Contracts
Schedule 1.01 (b)
Adjusted Volume:
For Exchange Traded Contracts with the following delivery periods and volume quantities,
the of the Mirror OTC Contracts to be entered into between REPS and the Sleeve Provider as part of the (EFS Transaction or ICE Block Transaction) under the Credit Sleeve and Reimbursement Agreement will be computed as follow:
"Adjusted Volume"
"AZP" shall be the Adjusted Zero Prices that corresponds to the date on the Adjusted Zero Curve which is defined below. The Adjusted Volume will be rounded off to the nearest full unit (mmbtu or mwh).
Calculation of Adjusted Zero Curve:
The Credit Sleeve Provider will calculate an adjusted LIBOR forward curve (the each day by adding the marginal cost of capital adder (the "MCC Adder") to the inputs used to calculate the Merrill Lynch & Co. standard LIBOR curve (the "Merrill LIBOR Curve").
"Adjusted LIBOR Forward Curve")
 
"MCC Adder" shall be:
(a) 0.0028; for purposes of calculating the Adjusted Volume of Mirror OTC Contracts executed in connection with (EFS Transactions or ICE Block Transactions) that are Effective Date Transactions described in Section 2.03(a) of the Credit Sleeve Reimbursement Agreement; and
(b) the marginal cost of capital relative to LIBOR that all Merrill Lynch & Co.'s trading desks are charged for the use of funds by Merrill Lynch & Co. (as of the date of such EFS Transaction or ICE Block Transaction), which amount is relative to LIBOR that is the average cost of capital for Merrill Lynch & Co. across all maturities (such MCC Adder can be positive or negative); for purposes of calculating the Adjusted Volume of Mirror OTC Contracts executed in connection with EFS Transactions or ICE Block Transactions that are Ongoing Transactions described in Section 2.03(b) of the Credit Sleeve Reimbursement Agreement
As of the Effective Date, the MCC Adder described in subsection (b) above is 0.0028; however, such amount may change in accordance with changes to Merrill Lynch & Co.'s marginal cost of capital as described above.
shall be the LIBOR curve used by Merrill Lynch & Co. and its subsidiaries in their U.S. and world wide swap and futures operations and business and used to mark its interest rate position to market. It is understood that Merrill Lynch & Co. may modify the inputs for how it determines this curve; however, it will continue to use the same curve for the Merrill LIBOR Curve as used in this Schedule and for its other operations as described in the foregoing sentence.
"Merrill LIBOR Curve"
Using the Adjusted LIBOR Forward Curve the Sleeve Provider will calculate a corresponding zero curve (the "Adjusted Zero Curve"), and provide such Adjusted Zero Curve to REPS on each Business Day, no later than 10:00 a.m. CST, and such curve shall be applicable to the (EFS Transactions and ICE Block Transactions) that are executed on that day. The Adjusted Zero Curve will be a strip of monthly Adjusted Zero Prices, which represent the present value of $1.00 dollar received on a specific date in the future, assuming the Adjusted LIBOR Forward Curve for discounting purposes with discounting being computed utilizing the continuously compounding methodology. The Adjusted Zero Curve provided will have 5 places after the decimal point.
The term of the Adjusted LIBOR Forward Curve and the corresponding Adjusted Zero Curve will be 72 months, including the then current month; provided, however, that to the extent REPS currently has or in the future obtains an Exchange Traded Contract for a longer period, then the Sleeve Provider will extend the Adjusted LIBOR Forward Curve and the Adjusted Zero Curve to match such longer period. Adjusted Zero Prices that correspond to dates that are between the Monthly Dates in the table below will be
 
calculated using linear interpolation. The format utilized by the Sleeve Provider in providing this information will include at a minimum the following attributes:
Treatment for Options:
For purposes of clarification the Parties agree that no adjustment will be made to the volumes of options transactions which are transferred pursuant to EOO Transactions under the Credit Sleeve Reimbursement Agreement, or in other words the Adjusted Volume of any Mirror OTC Contract that is an option will be the exact same volume as the volume of the corresponding Exchange Traded Contract.
Physical Exposure Management Fee:
For Exchange Traded Contracts that provide for physical delivery, (both futures contracts and options that provide for physical delivery futures contracts) and are transferred to the Sleeve Provider pursuant to an EFS or EOO Transaction, the following will apply: The Mirror OTC Transaction's confirm will specify that REPS agrees to pay to Sleeve Provider (or Sleeve Provider agrees to pay to REPS) a fee (the or "") equal to: either (i) the actual EFS or EOO Transaction premium paid or received by Sleeve Provider to liquidate the physical exposure or (ii) if Sleeve Provider takes the position in its own book, the average of two broker quotes on the day Sleeve Provider takes the position (which quotes shall be of the applicable buy or sell side from the Sleeve Provider's perspective of the premium for the EFS or EOO of the same product and delivery month), multiplied by the volume in the EFS or EOO Transaction. Sleeve Provider will provide REPS notice of the PhEM amount within 2 Business Days of either liquidating the physical exposure with a third party or taking the position on the Sleeve Provider's own book. REPS may request that the Sleeve Provider provide deal tickets as evidence of the actual premium paid or received by Sleeve Provider or instant messaging prints of broker quotes. PhEM shall be due and payable by the applicable Party at the time of settlement of the Mirror OTC Transaction associated with such EOO or EFS Transaction.

"Correlation Curves"
REPS may challenge the Merrill LIBOR Curve, Merrill Market Forward Pricing Curves, Merrill Volatility Curves and any other Sleeve Provider curves or inputs or modifications (herein collectively, referred to as the ""), used by the Sleeve Provider in calculating the Risk Limits and Current Mark-to-Market. If the parties cannot reach agreement on the Curve Inputs within two days after such challenge, then REPS may require that a third party expert be used to choose between the Sleeve Provider's methodology for determining the Curve Inputs and a specific alternative methodology proposed by REPS for use in determining the Curve Inputs for a specified product, location or time period. The third party expert will be designated by REPS from a list of at least three qualified and impartial experts which list shall promptly (and in no event more than two Business Days following request therefor), be provided by the Sleeve Provider to REPS. Such expert shall be required to choose between the Curve Inputs used by the Sleeve Provider and those inputs proposed by REPS and to identify which it determines is more accurate, and the inputs used as Curve Inputs thereafter shall be formulated by the Sleeve Provider in a manner consistent with the inputs so selected and thereafter such Curve Inputs as so formulated will be the Curve Inputs for all purposes hereunder. The expenses of the expert will be paid by the Party whose inputs are not selected by the expert.
Curve Inputs
Prior to the agreement on any change in the Curve Inputs, the provisions of the CSRA with respect to Risk Limits and Current Mark-to-Market will continue to be applicable on the basis of the calculation of Risk Limits and Current Mark-to-Market by the Sleeve Provider immediately prior to, and during, any challenge by REPS.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) has completed its $287.5 million acquisition of Reliant Energy's retail business which provides electricity service to more than 1.7 million customers in Texas. The sale, announced on March 2 and closed effective today, creates a stronger and more reliable competitive business that benefits Texas consumers. While NRG intends to provide executive management, financial, commercial operations and risk functional support, the retail business will continue to function as a self-contained business unit doing business as Reliant Energy and headquartered in Houston.
HOUSTON, TX; May 1, 2009
"The success of Reliant's retail electricity business is based on two things: great customer service and competitive pricing and we believe our customers will benefit from the combination of NRG and Reliant in a variety of ways," said David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Indeed, we expect price reductions to take place almost immediately and that is good news for Texas consumers just in time for summer."
In addition to offering a variety of plans from fixed energy prices and flexible monthly options to meet the needs of individual customers, Reliant will be expanding the renewable portion of its supply portfolio and strengthening its service commitment to residential customers who are moving residences.
Reliant now will operate as part of NRG Texas, which is run by Kevin Howell, Executive Vice President of NRG and President of NRG Texas. Jason Few, previously Reliant's Senior Vice President, Mass Markets & Operations, has been named President, Reliant Energy and Senior Vice President, Retail for NRG, reporting to Howell.
"All of the services that you've come to know and respect about Reliant Energy will remain the same. We'll have the same reliable team of people that you've come to count on to provide the 24/7 customer care that has earned such high satisfaction ratings from customers," said Howell. "We are committed to Texas and that includes maintaining our joint commitment to our communities, the environment, and the ERCOT market."
Excluding transaction and other one-time costs, NRG expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to EBITDA and free cash flow, and fully accretive in 2010. NRG will pay $287.5 million in cash and will remit net working capital to Reliant's parent company, RRI Energy, over the next six months. Given NRG's diverse asset base, this transaction provides for an efficient credit structure as it allows for significant reduction in actual and contingent collateral. By backing Reliant's load-serving requirements with NRG's generation, the need to sell and buy power from other financial
 
institutions and intermediaries that trade in the ERCOT market will be reduced significantly, resulting in reduced transaction costs and credit exposures.
"We have believed for some time now that increasing sustainability and fighting climate change must be a top priority for the electricity sector and that NRG should play an important role in that effort. Until now, we limited our efforts to the wholesale generation business through our NRG initiative to revitalize our power plant asset base with more efficient and lower carbon generating technologies," said Crane. "With Reliant's base of retail customers, we now have a platform to build on the entire class of distributed generation and retail alternative energy technologiesincluding smart meters and solar powered rooftop installations and ultimately, electric vehicles, among other distributed technologiesthat directly benefit consumers and the environment."
