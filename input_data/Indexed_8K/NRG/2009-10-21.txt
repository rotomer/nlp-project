Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On October 15, 2009, Robert C. Flexon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, informed NRG Energy, Inc. (the "Company") that he will be resigning from the Company, effective November 2, 2009, to assume the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Foster Wheeler USA Corporation, a subsidiary of Foster Wheeler AG.
     While the Company conducts an internal and external search for a new Chief Financial Officer, Gerald Luterman was appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company on October 15, 2009, effective November 3, 2009. Mr. Luterman, 65, has served as a Director of the Company since April 2009. Prior to his appointment to the Company's Board of Directors, Mr. Luterman served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Keyspan Corporation from August 1999 until his retirement in September 2007 following National Grid's acquisition of Keyspan.
     Mr. Luterman will continue to serve on the Company's Board as a non-independent director during his service as Interim Chief Executive Officer. NRG expects Mr. Luterman to serve as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company through the successful conclusion of the search process for a permanent replacement which is expected to last at least through the announcement of the Company's full year 2009 financial results anticipated to be released in late February 2010. Mr. Luterman's compensation for his interim service will be $100,000 monthly.

A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Any proxy is suspended when the person executing the proxy is present at a meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the proxy, notwithstanding the presence of the person executing the proxy. At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any voting commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall be submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the secretary, and no shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has been found to be invalid or irregular.

In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the Corporation.

In that event, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or certificates and record the transaction on its books. Each such new certificate will be registered in such name as is requested by the holder of the surrendered certificate and shall be substantially identical in form to the surrendered certificate. Upon the receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated shares, if any, such uncertificated shares shall be cancelled, issuance of new equivalent uncertificated or certificated shares shall be made to the stockholder entitled thereto and the transaction shall recorded upon the books and records of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or registrars or both in connection with the transfer of any class or series of securities of the Corporation.

Lost Certificates
 
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.
      .

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is first given. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings
      .

Section 4.
Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes
      . Prior to the surrender to the Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof.
Section 5.
Registered Stockholders
      . Unless otherwise provided for in any subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

In case of default in the payment of any installment or call when such payment is due, the Corporation may proceed to collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the Corporation.
