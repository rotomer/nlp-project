Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On March 1, 2010, Nuclear Innovation North America LLC ("NINA"), an 88% percent owned indirect subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a Project Agreement, Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the "Settlement Agreement"), by and among the City of San Antonio acting by and through the City Public Service Board of San Antonio, a Texas municipal utility ("CPS Energy"), NINA Texas 3 LLC ("NINA 3") and NINA Texas 4 LLC ("NINA 4", and together with NINA 3, the "NINA Parties"), and solely for purposes of certain sections of the Settlement Agreement, by the Company and NRG South Texas LP ("NRG South Texas"). The Settlement Agreement memorializes NINA's February 17, 2010 agreement in principle with CPS Energy to acquire a controlling interest in the project to construct STP Units 3 and 4 through a settlement of all outstanding litigation among the parties. As part of the resolution of this dispute, on March 1, 2010, the NINA Parties and the City of San Antonio also entered into the STP 3 & 4 Owners Agreement (the "Owners Agreement").
     The Owners Agreement replaces the interim agreement previously reached among the parties on October 29, 2007. The Owners Agreement: (i) finalizes the ownership percentages for the STP 3 & 4 project at 92.375% for NINA and 7.625%% for CPS Energy, (ii) provides that NINA will assume all management and control of the STP 3 & 4 project, (iii) specifies that NINA will be responsible for all development costs incurred after January 31, 2010, and (iv) provides that CPS Energy will withdraw its loan guarantee application with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") and fully support NINA's loan guarantee application with the DOE. The Settlement Agreement dismisses all litigation with prejudice and obligates NRG to pay CPS Energy $80 million upon the receipt by NINA of a term sheet for a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with the DOE. The first $40 million is due after receipt of the term sheet for a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee and the remaining $40 million is payable six months thereafter. The Company also committed to donate $10 million in equal installments over four years to the Residential Energy Assistance Partnership in San Antonio.
     A copy of the Settlement Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and a copy of the Owners Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K. The description of the material terms of the Settlement Agreement and the Owners Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.

"The Court makes the following findings with regard to the dispute presented to the Court earlier this week, and I just give you a heads up. What I usually do is the notes that I have to prepare for the file for the next judge who picks up this case are available for copying after I finish. And I use the notes as an outline and I may expand from that, but what I tell my court reporter on the record is what counts. All right. The supplemental contract between the City and NRG contains a right for each party to cease participation in the activities contemplated by the agreement to perform engineering, design, contract preparation, purchasing, inspection, accounting, analyses, testing, management and eventual construction of Units 3 and 4 of the South Texas Nuclear Power Plant Project. Ceasing participation means eventual withdrawal from the agreement to perform the above activities. The supplemental agreement obligates each party to pay additional costs as set out in the contract to complete the cessation of participation in the activities previously mentioned. As of January 29th, 2010, the parties to this dispute are equity share owners and they are tenants in common as to said equity shares and each owns a 50 percent equity share ownership in the project. The contract is silent on the issue of forfeiture of any equity share ownership in the event a party decides to cease participation in the activities leading to the building and completion of Units 3 and 4 of the South Texas Nuclear Plant Project. Therefore, no forfeiture of interest exists. Unsuccessful attempts to claim otherwise are nothing more than tortured extrapolation. An equity share owner who chooses cessation of participation remains a tenant in common with regard to said equity shares with the non-ceasing owner on a 50/50 basis with the caveat expressed hereafter. The contract is silent as to when or how the ceasing-to-participate equity shareholder's interest is dealt with if the non-ceasing-to-participate equity shareholder decides to proceed and pay for all future costs associated with completion of the project. Unless the parties agree on how to deal with that possibility through future negotiations in reaching a final agreement as referred to several times in the contract, principles of law that are equitable in nature will have to be applied through future court action to determine an equitable solution to compensate the non-ceasing equity shareholder for such continuation. Equity abhors a forfeiture, but by the same token, equity will not allow someone to profit at the expense of another. The supplemental agreement is silent as to any procedure for the City or NRG to recoup a portion or all of its costs invested to the date it decides to cease participation in the development of the project. The supplemental contract does not equate cessation of participation in the project as an event of default. As of 1-29-2010, there was no evidence presented that could allow the Court to declare either party in default under the supplemental agreement. Some words of caution to the City. If you want to be in the play,
 
you have to pay or you can't stay. You will eventually lose your equity share. I submit that the parties should go back to the negotiating table and reach a final agreement. It's mentioned several times in the supplemental agreement that there was to be a final agreement to work out some of these details with the provisions that I have ordered this morning. It's my hope that the negotiators and the lawyers who assist in this process will be at least equal to the caliber of the lawyers that have made the presentations in this courtroom. As I said, my notes are available for copying if you would like. I will give them to my clerk and he will make a copy for you."
