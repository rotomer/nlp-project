Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 3, 2010, NRG Energy, Inc. (the "Company") completed the early unwinding of the Common Stock Finance I notes and preferred interests ("CSF I Debt") by remitting a cash payment to Credit Suisse of approximately $242 million to settle the outstanding principal and interest, as compared to $249 million that would have been due at maturity in June 2010. As part of the unwind, Credit Suisse returned 6,600,000 shares of NRG common stock borrowed under the Share Lending Agreement between the parties and released all 12,441,973 common shares held as collateral for the CSF I Debt. The 6,600,000 shares of NRG common stock were returned to treasury stock and will no longer be treated as outstanding for corporate law purposes, thereby reducing the Companys outstanding shares of common stock from that reported in the Companys most recent 10-K to 255,353,023 shares as of March 3, 2010. The 6,600,000 shares were not considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting the Company 19;s basic or diluted earnings per share in the Companys most recent 10-K. With the recent settlement of the Common Stock Finance II notes and preferred interests in November 2009, the Company has now settled all obligations related to the Common Stock Finance I and II Note Purchase Agreements and Preferred Interest Purchase Agreements entered into in 2006, as amended from time to time, as well as the Share Lending Agreement entered into in February 2009.
