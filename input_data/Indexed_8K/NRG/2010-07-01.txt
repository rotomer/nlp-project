     On June 30, 2010, NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG") completed an amendment and extension (the "Amendment") of its senior secured credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility"). NRG's Senior Credit Facility is comprised of a term loan facility (the "Term Loan"), a synthetic letter of credit facility (the "Synthetic LC Facility") and a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). As a result of the Amendment, NRG extended the maturity date for approximately $1,000 million of the $1,976 million outstanding Term Loan to August 31, 2015 and the remaining amount is due on the original maturity date of February 1, 2013. In addition, the maturity date of the new $875 million Revolving Credit Facility will be August 31, 2015. Finally, the existing Synthetic LC Facility was converted into a Term Loan backed LC Facility (on an "on-balance sheet" basis), which term loans in an amount of $800 million will mature on August 31, 2015 with $500 maturing on the original maturity date of February 1, 2013.
     In connection with the Amendment, NRG formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entity ("NRG LC") that entered into two separate Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreements which agreements providing for the issuance of Term Loan backed LC's in an amount of up to $1.3 billion.
     The pricing of the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR (the "Adjusted LIBO Rate") + 325 basis points, subject to reductions available upon the achievement of certain financial ratios.
     The pricing of the extended portion of the Term Loan and the extended portion of the Synthetic LC Facility is the Adjusted LIBO Rate + 325 basis points. The non-extended portion of the Term Loan and Synthetic LC Facility will maintain their original pricing.
     The Amendment also changed certain other terms of the Senior Credit Facility, including amendments that:
     Copies of the Amendment and the Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreements are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2(a) and Exhibit 10.2(b) respectively to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The description of the material terms of the Amendment and the Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement are qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.
 
     The disclosures under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Amendment and the Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement are also responsive to Item 2.03 of this report and are incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

     (a) each Term Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, that all of its Term Loans under and as defined in the Second Restated Credit Agreement and outstanding on the Third Restatement Date shall be continued (but not re-evidenced) as Term B Loans hereunder, which shall be Extended Maturity Term Loans with respect to each Term Lender that so indicated on its signature page to the Third Amendment Agreement and which shall be Original Maturity Term Loans with respect to all other Term Lenders;
     (b) each Revolving Credit Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to fund Revolving Loans to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time after the Third Restatement Date and until the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Revolving Credit Lender and the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with the terms hereof in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment; and
     (c) each Funded L/C Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, that all of its Credit-Linked Deposits under the Second Restated Credit Agreement and outstanding on the Third Restatement Date shall be converted into and deemed to be Term Loans made to the Borrower hereunder on the Third Restatement Date to be contributed by the Borrower to the Funded L/C SPV pursuant to the Funded L/C SPV Equity Contribution and to be deposited by the Funded L/C SPV in the Funded L/C Collateral Accounts on the Third Restatement Date, and that such Credit-Linked Deposits shall be Extended Maturity Credit-Linked Deposits with respect to each Funded L/C Lender that so indicated on its signature page to the Third Amendment Agreement and shall be Original Maturity Credit Linked Deposits with respect to all other Funded L/C Lenders.
     Within the limits set forth in clause (b) above and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans (including Credit-Linked Deposits) may not be reborrowed.
     SECTION 2.02. . (a) Each Loan (other than Swingline Loans) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class; , , that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). Except for Loans deemed made pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and subject to Section 2.22 relating to Swingline Loans, the Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.

provided
however
     (b) Subject to Sections 2.08 and 2.15, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or
 
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; that any exercise of such option shall (i) not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (ii) not result in increased costs for the Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 or 2.20 and (iii) take into account the obligations of each Lender to mitigate increased costs pursuant to Section 2.21 hereof. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; , , that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in more than 16 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings. On the Third Restatement Date, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Interest Periods with respect to the Term B Loans shall be as follows: (A) Term B Loans shall be continued as Eurodollar Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the Term B Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans (such Term B Loans to correspond in amount to Term B Loans of a given Interest Period), (B) Interest Periods for the Term B Loans described in clause (A) above shall end on the same dates as the Interest Periods applicable for the corresponding Term B Loans described in clause (A) above and the Adjusted LIBO Rates applicable to such Term B Loans during such Interest Periods shall be the same as those applicable to such Term B Loans, (C) Term B Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of Term B Loans then outstanding as ABR Loans, and (D) the Borrower will not be required to make any payments under Section 2.16 of the Second Restated Credit Agreement or of this Agreement in connection with the continuation of Term B Loans or the conversion of Credit-Linked Deposits into Term Loans (and the applicable Lenders hereby expressly waive any such requirement to make any such payments under Section 2.16).

     (c) Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and subject to Section 2.22 relating to Swingline Loans, each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.
     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing (in lieu of interest which would otherwise become due to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.06) or (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error). If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
 
     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing which is a Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the latest Revolving Credit Maturity Date at such time.
     (f) If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from the Borrower the payment required to be made by Section 2.23(e) with respect to a Letter of Credit within the time specified in such Section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the L/C Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of such L/C Disbursement and its Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Credit Lender shall have received such notice later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on any day, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement (it being understood that such amount shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Revolving Loan of such Lender and such payment shall be deemed to have reduced the Revolving L/C Exposure), and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from the Revolving Credit Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.23(e) prior to the time that any Revolving Credit Lender makes any payment pursuant to this paragraph; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. If any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in accordance with this paragraph to but excluding the date such amount is paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a) (in lieu of interest which would otherwise become due to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.06), and (ii) in the case of such Lender, for the first such day, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and for each day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate; and that under no circumstances shall such Lender be entitled to seek indemnity from any Loan Party in respect of any interest so accrued or paid.

     (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
     (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period in effect therefor or (iii) any Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a "") or (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment required to be made hereunder. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include, in the case of a Lender, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender believes it is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, including the calculations and criteria applied to determine such amount or amounts, and other documentation or information reasonably supporting the conclusions in such certificate, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding.

Breakage Event
     SECTION 2.17. . Except as provided below in this Section 2.17 with respect to Swingline Loans and as required under Section 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 2.20, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of reimbursement obligations, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each reduction of the Term Loan Commitments, the Total Credit-Linked Deposit or the Revolving Credit Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans). For purposes of determining the available Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at any time, each outstanding Swingline Loan shall be deemed to have utilized the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders which shall not have made Swingline Loans) pro rata in accordance with such respective Revolving Credit Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.
Pro Rata Treatment
     SECTION 2.18. . Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans or L/C Disbursement as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans
Sharing of Setoffs
 
and participations in L/C Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure and participations in Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; , however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan or L/C Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon) (or such other time as otherwise required by Section 2.23(e)), New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Each such payment (other than (i) Issuing Bank Fees, which shall be paid directly to the Issuing Bank, (ii) principal of and interest on Swingline Loans, which shall be paid directly to the Swingline Lender except as otherwise provided in Section 2.22(e) and (iii) payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.16 or 2.20, which at the election of the Borrower may be made directly to the Lender claiming the benefit of any such Sections) shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 390 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013 by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or as otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent). The Administrative Agent shall pay to each Lender any payment received on such Lender's behalf promptly after the Administrative Agent's receipt of such payment. All payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in dollars.
Payments
     (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.
     SECTION 2.20. . (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall be required to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions and withholdings been made, (ii) the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall make (or cause to be made) such deductions and withholdings and (iii) the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, or any of their respective Affiliates, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Government Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability shall be delivered to the Borrower by an Issuing Bank or a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of an Issuing Bank or a Lender, promptly upon such party's determination of an indemnifiable event and such certificate shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error; that the failure to deliver such certificate shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.20(c) except to the extent the Borrower is actually prejudiced thereby. Payment under this Section 2.20(c) shall be made within 15 days from the date of delivery of such certificate; that the Borrower shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lender (as the case may be) in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if and to the extent that such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, or to the failure of the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender to deliver a timely certificate as to the amount of an indemnifiable liability.

     (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the reasonable written request of the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or delivery would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
provided
     In addition, each Foreign Lender shall (i) furnish on or before it becomes a party to this Agreement either (a) two accurate and complete originally executed U.S. Internal Revenue
 
Service Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or (b) an accurate and complete U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form), certifying, in either case, to such Foreign Lender's legal entitlement to an exemption or reduction from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to all interest payments hereunder, and (ii) provide a new Form W-8BEN and/or Form W-8IMY, as applicable (or successor form) or Form W-8ECI (or successor form) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form to reconfirm any complete exemption from, or any entitlement to a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to any interest payment hereunder; provided that any Foreign Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and is relying on the so-called "portfolio interest exemption" shall also furnish a "Non-Bank Certificate" in the form of Exhibit J together with a Form W-8BEN (or successor form). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.

     (g) For purposes of this Section 2.20, in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by such Lender with respect to payments made by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be treated as Taxes required to be deducted by the Borrower, but only to the extent such Taxes would have been required to be deducted and withheld by the Lender if it were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes making such payments under the Loan Documents on behalf of the Borrower and Excluded Taxes were defined by reference to the partner (treating the partner as a Foreign Lender) to whom payments are made.
     (h) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of all amounts due hereunder.

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit
 
(i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.
     (g) . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the applicable Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Revolving Credit Lender notice thereof.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
     (h) . If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest for the account of the Issuing Bank, for each day from and including the date of such L/C Disbursement to but excluding the earlier of the date of payment by the Borrower or the date on which interest shall commence to accrue thereon as provided in Section 2.02(f), at the rate per annum that would apply to such amount if such amount were an ABR Revolving Loan.
Interim Interest
     (i) . Any Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and may be removed at any time by the Borrower by notice to such Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder by a Lender that shall agree to serve as successor Issuing Bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights and obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its obligations to issue additional, extend, or increase the amount of Letters of Credit hereunder without affecting its rights and obligations with respect to Letters of Credit previously issued by it. At the time such removal or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii). The acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the resignation or removal of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or
Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank
 
removal, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or increase the amount of Letters of Credit then outstanding.
     (j) . If any Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII shall occur and be continuing, or the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated and/or the Commitments have been terminated, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders) thereof and of the amount to be deposited, deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure, an amount in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date. Such deposit shall be held, upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower with respect to Letters of Credit under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in Cash Equivalents, which investments shall be made by the Administrative Agent in accordance with its internal policies applied to transactions of the size and nature provided for in the Loan Documents, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans, and/or termination of the Commitments, moneys in such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Majority Revolving Credit Lenders), be applied to satisfy the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and/or termination of the Commitments, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all such Events of Default have been cured or waived.
Cash Collateralization
     (k) . The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of the Agreement. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be an "Issuing Bank" (in addition to being a Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Lender.
Additional Issuing Banks
     SECTION 2.24 . (a) On the Third Restatement Date, the Funded L/C SPV shall establish a Funded L/C Collateral Account in respect of each Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit Facility for the purpose of cash collateralizing the Funded L/C SPV's obligations to one or more LC Issuers pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the applicable Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit Facilities. On the Third Restatement Date, the proceeds of the Credit-Linked Deposits received by the Funded L/C SPV from the Borrower pursuant to the Funded L/C SPV Equity Contribution shall be deposited in each such applicable Funded L/C Collateral Account.

manner contemplated by Section 2.01(c). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the Borrower (or, in the case of fees and specified return in accordance with Section 2.24(b) of the Second Restated Credit Agreement, the Deposit Bank or the Borrower, as applicable) shall pay to each Funded L/C Lender holding a Credit-Linked Deposit immediately prior to the Third Restatement Date, through the Administrative Agent, all fees accrued on such Credit-Linked Deposit pursuant to the Second Restated Credit Agreement through the Third Restatement Date, as more fully set forth in the Third Amendment Agreement.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Revolving Credit Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and if any Swingline Exposure or Revolving L/C Exposure exists at the time such Revolving Credit Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then so long as such Swingline Exposure or Revolving L/C Exposure exists:

     (b) if the reallocation described in clause (a) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (i) first, prepay such Swingline Loans and (ii) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (a) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.23(j) for so long as such Revolving L/C Exposure is outstanding; and
     (c) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with clauses (a) and (b) above, and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (a) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).

     In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and the Revolving L/C Exposure of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Revolving Credit Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage.

     (ii) if, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of Sections 6.13 and 6.14, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of Sections 6.13 and 6.14 as of the relevant date of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of Sections 6.13 and 6.14 that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement.

Agents
     Each bank serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
     No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as in Section 9.08), and (c) except as expressly set
provided
 
forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as any Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08), in each case, in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
     Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
     Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject to the Borrower's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective
 
Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent.
     Each of the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents and each Arranger, in its capacity as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents, the Arrangers, or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
     To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Account Party to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Account Party to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Party to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Account Party that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in
 
each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.

     (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Account Party hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Account Party contained in this Section 2.14 shall survive the payment in full of all amounts due hereunder.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Account Party to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Account Party to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Party to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Account Party that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.
     SECTION 2.06. . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give fax or email notification, confirmed by telephone, to the Account Party of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Account Party of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.

promptly upon demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Issuing Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
     (b) If the Issuing Bank shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank to a level below that which the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time the Account Party shall pay to the Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability shall be delivered to the Account Party by the Issuing Bank promptly upon the Issuing Bank's determination of an indemnifiable event and such certificate shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error; that the failure to deliver such certificate shall not affect the obligations of the Account Party under this Section 2.14(b) except to the extent the Account Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Payment under this Section 2.14(b) shall be made within 15 days from the date of delivery of such certificate; that the Account Party shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the Issuing Bank in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if and to the extent that such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment or to the failure of the Issuing Bank to deliver a timely certificate as to the amount of an indemnifiable liability.

The non-extended portions will mature on the originally scheduled date of February 1, 2013.
