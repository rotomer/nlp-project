In no event, however, shall the Committee modify the distribution terms in any Award or Grant Agreement that has a feature for the deferral of compensation if such modification would result in taxes, additional interest and/or penalties pursuant to Code Section 409A. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall be authorized to (i) select persons to participate in the Plan, (ii) determine the form and substance of grants made under the Plan to each Participant, and the conditions and restrictions, if any, subject to which such grants will be made, (iii) determine the form and substance of the Grant Agreements reflecting the terms and conditions of each grant made under the Plan, (iv) certify that the conditions and restrictions applicable to any grant have been met, (v) modify the terms of grants made under the Plan, (vi) interpret the Plan and Grant Agreements entered into under the Plan, (vii) determine the duration and purposes for leaves of absence which may be granted to a Participant on an individual basis without constituting a termination of employment or services for purposes of the Plan, (viii) make any adjustments necessary or desirable in connection with grants made under the Plan to eligible Participants located outside the United States, (ix) adopt, amend, or rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, correcting any defect or supplying any omission, or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Grant Agreement, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or advisable, including so that the Plan and the operation of the Plan complies with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, the Code to the extent applicable and other applicable law and make such other determinations for carrying out the Plan as it may deem appropriate, and (x) exercise such powers and perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not take any of the following actions without shareholder approval, except as provided in : (i) reduce the exercise price following the grant of an option or SAR; (ii) exchange an option or SAR which has an exercise price that is greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share for cash or Shares or (iii) cancel an option or SAR in exchange for a replacement option or another Award with a lower exercise price.

Section 17
The expenses of the Plan shall be borne by the Company. The Plan shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or make any other segregation of assets to assume the payment of any Award under the Plan, and rights to the payment of such Awards shall be no greater than the rights of the Company's general creditors.
Subject to adjustments as provided in , an aggregate of 22,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "") may be issued pursuant to the Plan. Such Shares may be in whole or in part authorized and unissued or held by the Company as treasury shares. If any grant under the Plan expires or terminates unexercised, becomes unexercisable or is forfeited as to any Shares, or is tendered or withheld as to any Shares in payment of the exercise price of the grant or the taxes payable with respect to the exercise, then such unpurchased, forfeited, tendered or withheld Shares shall thereafter be available for further grants under the Plan unless, in the case of options granted under the Plan, related SARs are exercised. With respect to SARs that are settled in Common Stock, upon settlement, only the number of shares of Common Stock delivered to a Participant upon the exercise of the SARs shall count against the number of Shares issued under the Plan. Any Award under the Plan settled in cash shall not be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations. The maximum number of shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options may be granted shall be 8,000,000. Shares issued under Awards granted in assumption, substitution or exchange for previously granted awards of a company acquired by the Company ("") shall not reduce Shares available under Plan. Available shares under a stockholder approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect such acquisition) may be used for Awards under this Plan and shall not reduce the number of Shares available under this Plan, except as required by the rules of any applicable stock exchange.
Section 17
Shares
Substitute Awards
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this or the generality of the provisions of , or any other section of this Plan, the Committee may, at any time or from time to time, and on such terms and conditions (that are consistent with and not in contravention of the other provisions of this Plan) as the Committee may determine, enter into Grant Agreements (or take other actions with respect to the Awards) for new Awards containing terms (including, without limitation, exercise prices) more (or less) favorable than the then-outstanding Awards.
Section 4
Sections 3
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 19
Participation in the Plan shall be limited to the Participants. Nothing in the Plan or in any Grant Agreement shall confer any right on a Participant to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of or in the performance of services for the Company or shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the employment or performance of services or to reduce the compensation or responsibilities of a Participant at any time. By accepting any Award under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through him or her shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated his or her acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan by the Company, the Board or the Committee.
Awards may be granted to such persons and for such number of Shares as the Committee shall determine, subject to the limitations contained herein (such individuals to whom grants are made being sometimes herein called "optionees" or "grantees," as the case may be). Determinations made by the Committee under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made selectively among eligible individuals under the Plan, whether or not such individuals are similarly situated. A grant of any type made hereunder in any one year to an eligible Participant shall neither guarantee nor preclude a further grant of that or any other type to such Participant in that year or subsequent years.
The Committee may from time to time grant to eligible Participants Incentive Stock Options, Non-qualified Stock Options, or any combination thereof; provided that, the Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options only to eligible employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (as defined for this purpose in Section 424(f) of the Code or any successor thereto). In any one calendar year, the Committee shall not grant to any one Participant options to purchase a number of Shares of Common Stock in excess of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Grant Agreement and shall take such form as the Committee shall determine, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
It is the Company's intent that Non-qualified Stock Options granted under the Plan not be classified as Incentive Stock Options, that Incentive Stock Options be consistent with and contain or be deemed to contain all provisions required under Section 422 of the Code and any successor thereto, and that any ambiguities in construction be interpreted in order to effectuate such intent. If an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan does not qualify as such for any reason, then to the extent of such non-qualification, the stock option represented thereby shall be regarded as a Non-qualified Stock Option duly granted under the Plan; provided that, such stock option otherwise meets the Plan's requirements for Non-qualified Stock Options.
(a) . The price per Share deliverable upon the exercise of each option (the "") shall be established by the Committee, except that in the case of the grant of any option, the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the option except for Substitute Awards, which shall have the exercise price as determined by the Committee provided that such exercise price does not cause the Substitute Award to become subject to Code Section 409A and the Committee takes into consideration any third-party voting guidelines. In the case of the grant of any Incentive Stock Option to an employee who, at the time of the grant, owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the exercise price may not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of grant of the option, in each case unless otherwise permitted by Section 422 of the Code or any successor thereto.
Price
exercise price
(b) . Options may be exercised, in whole or in part, upon payment of the exercise price of the Shares to be acquired. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, payment shall be made (i) in cash (including check, bank draft, money order or wire transfer of immediately available funds), (ii) by delivery of outstanding shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price payable with respect to the options' exercise, (iii) by means of any cashless exercise procedures approved by the Committee and as may be in effect on the date of exercise, (iv) by withholding shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon exercise of the Option having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price or (v) by any combination of the foregoing.
Payment
In the event a grantee is permitted to, and elects to pay the exercise price payable with respect to an option pursuant to clause (ii) above, (A) only a whole number of share(s) of Common Stock (and not fractional shares of Common Stock) may be tendered in payment, (B) such grantee must present evidence acceptable to the Company that he or she has owned any such shares of Common Stock tendered in payment of the exercise price (and that such tendered shares of Common Stock have not been subject to any substantial risk of forfeiture) for at least six months prior to the date of exercise or such longer period as determined from time to time by the Committee, and (C) Common Stock must be delivered to the Company. Delivery for this purpose may, at the election of the grantee, be made either by (A) physical delivery of the certificate(s) for all such shares of Common Stock tendered in payment of the exercise price, accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer in a form acceptable to the Company, (B) direction to the grantee's broker to transfer, by book entry, such shares of Common Stock from a brokerage account of the grantee to a brokerage account specified by the Company, or (C) the attestation of the grantee's shares of Common Stock. When payment of the exercise price is made by delivery of Common Stock, the difference, if any, between the aggregate exercise price payable with respect to the option being exercised and the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock tendered in payment (plus any applicable taxes) shall be paid in cash. No grantee may tender shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value exceeding the aggregate exercise price payable with respect to the option being exercised (plus any applicable taxes).
(c) . The term during which each option may be exercised shall be determined by the Committee, but if required by the Code, no option shall be exercisable in whole or in part more than ten years from the date it is granted, and no Incentive Stock Option granted to an employee who at the time of the grant owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be exercisable more than five years from the date it is granted. All rights to purchase Shares pursuant to an option shall, unless sooner terminated, expire on the date designated by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the date on which each option shall become exercisable and may provide that an option shall become exercisable in installments. The Committee may provide that upon the last day of the term of an Option whose exercise price is less than the fair market value of the underlying Share on such date, such Option may be automatically exercised and the Participant shall receive a number of Shares equal in value to the excess of the fair market value of a Share over the exercise price of such Option, less any applicable withholding taxes. The Shares constituting each installment may be purchased in whole or in part at any time after such installment becomes exercisable, subject to such minimum exercise requirements as may be designated by the Committee. Prior to the exercise of an option and delivery of the Shares represented thereby, the optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by such outstanding option (including any dividend or voting rights). If an Option (other than an Incentive Stock Option) expires on a day that the Participant cannot exercise the Option because such an exercise would violate an applicable federal, state, local, or foreign law, the expiration date shall be tolled, at the discretion of the Committee, to the date no later than 30 days after the date the exercise of such Option would no longer violate an applicable Federal, state, local, and foreign laws, to the extent allowed under Code Section 409A.
Terms of Options
(d) . If required by the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the grant date) of Shares for which an Incentive Stock Option is exercisable for the first time during any calendar year under all equity incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 422 of the Code or any successor thereto) may not exceed $100,000.
Limitations on Grants
(e) .
Termination; Forfeiture
(i) . Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or to perform other services for, the Company or any Subsidiary due to his or her death, all of the Participant's Awards shall become fully vested and all of the Participant's options shall become exercisable and shall remain so for a period of one year from the date of such death, but in no event after the expiration date of the options.
Death
(ii) . Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or to perform other services for, the Company or any Subsidiary due to Disability, (A) all of the Participant's options that were exercisable on the date of Disability shall remain exercisable for, and shall otherwise terminate and thereafter be forfeited at the end of, a period of one year after the date of Disability, but in no event after the expiration date of the options, and (B) all of the Participant's Awards that were not fully vested (or, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable) on the date of Disability shall be forfeited immediately upon such Disability; provided, however, that such Awards may become fully vested (and, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable) in the discretion of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disability giving rise to the termination of employment is not within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or any successor thereto, Incentive Stock Options not exercised by such Participant within 90 days after the date of termination of employment will cease to qualify as Incentive Stock Options and will be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options under the Plan if required to be so treated under the Code.
Disability
(iii) . Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be an officer or employee of, or to perform other services for, the Company or any Subsidiary upon the occurrence of his or her Retirement, (A) all of the Participant's options that were exercisable on the date of Retirement shall remain exercisable for, and shall otherwise terminate and thereafter be forfeited at the end of, a period of two years after the date of Retirement, but in no event after the expiration date of the options, and (B) all of the Participant's Awards that were not fully vested (or, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable) on the date of Retirement shall be forfeited immediately upon such Retirement; provided, however, that such Awards may become fully vested (and, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable) in the discretion of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options not exercised by such Participant within 90 days after Retirement will cease to qualify as Incentive Stock Options and will be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options under the Plan if required to be so treated under the Code.
Retirement
Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be a director of the Company or any Subsidiary upon the occurrence of his or her Retirement, all of the Participant's Awards shall become fully vested and all of the Participant's options shall become exercisable and shall remain so for a period of two years after the date of Retirement, but in no event after the expiration date of the options.
(iv) . Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if a Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or to perform other services for, the Company or a Subsidiary due to Cause, or if a Participant does not become a director, officer or employee of, or does not begin performing other services for, the Company or a Subsidiary for any reason, all of the Participant's Awards shall be forfeited immediately and all of the Participant's options shall expire and be forfeited immediately, whether or not then exercisable, upon such cessation or non-commencement.
Discharge for Cause
(v) . If a Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or to otherwise perform services for, the Company or a Subsidiary for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or Cause (each such termination referred to as an "Other Termination"), (A) all of the Participant's options that were exercisable on the date of such cessation shall remain exercisable for, and shall otherwise terminate and thereafter be forfeited at the end of, a period of 90 days after the date of such cessation, but in no event after the expiration date of the options, and (B) all of the Participant's Awards that were not fully vested (or, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable) on the date of such cessation shall be forfeited immediately upon such cessation. For the avoidance of doubt, an Other Termination with recall rights shall be considered an Other Termination to which this applies.
Other Termination
Section 6.e.(v)
The Committee shall have the authority to grant SARs under this Plan, either alone or to any optionee in tandem with options (either at the time of grant of the related option or thereafter by amendment to an outstanding option). SARs shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify. In any one calendar year, the Committee shall not grant to any one Participant SARs with respect to a number of Shares of Common Stock in excess of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
The exercise price of an SAR must equal or exceed the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR except for Substitute Awards, which shall have the exercise price as determined by the Committee provided that such exercise price does not cause the Substitute Award to become subject to Code Section 409A and the Committee takes into consideration any third-party voting guidelines. Prior to the exercise of the SAR and delivery of the Shares represented thereby, the Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by such outstanding SAR (including any dividend or voting rights).
SARs granted in tandem with options shall be exercisable only when, to the extent and on the conditions that any related option is exercisable. The exercise of an option shall result in an immediate forfeiture of any related SAR to the extent the option is exercised, and the exercise of an SAR shall cause an immediate forfeiture of any related option to the extent the SAR is exercised.
Upon the exercise of an SAR, the Participant shall be entitled to a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the difference between the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the SAR or, in the case of SARs granted in tandem with options, any option to which the SAR is related, multiplied by the number of Shares as to which the SAR is exercised. Such distribution shall be in cash and/or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to such amount, or any combination thereof as chosen by the Committee.
All SARs will be exercised automatically on the last day prior to the expiration date of the SAR or, in the case of SARs granted in tandem with options, any related option, so long as the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on that date exceeds the exercise price of the SAR or any related option, as applicable. An SAR granted in tandem with options shall expire at the same time as any related option expires and shall be transferable only when, and under the same conditions as, any related option is transferable. Unless otherwise determined by a Participant's Grant Agreement, each SAR shall be subject to the termination and forfeiture provisions as set forth in .
Section 6.e
The Committee may at any time and from time to time grant Shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the Plan to such Participants and in such amounts as it determines. Each restricted stock unit shall be equivalent in value to one share of Common Stock and shall entitle the Participant to receive from the Company at the end of the vesting period (the "Vesting Period") applicable to such unit the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, unless the Participant has elected at a time that complies with Code Section 409A to defer the receipt of shares of Common Stock.
Each grant of restricted stock units or Shares of restricted stock shall be evidenced by a Grant Agreement which shall specify the applicable restrictions on such units or Shares, the duration of such restrictions, and the time or times at which such restrictions shall lapse with respect to all or a specified number of units or Shares that are part of the grant; provided, however, except for maximum aggregate Awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units of 5% of the aggregate Shares authorized by , if the vesting condition for any Award, other than an Incentive Stock Option or Non-qualified Stock Option, that is settled in Common Stock (including Awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units)(a "Full Value Award"), relates (x) exclusively to the passage of time and continued employment, such time period shall not be less than 36 months, with thirty-three and one-third percent (33?%) of the Award vesting every 12 months from the date of the Award, subject to and (y) to the attainment of specified performance goals, such Full Value Award shall vest over a performance period of not less than one (1) year. Except for maximum aggregate Awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units of 5% of the aggregate Shares authorized by , the Committee shall not waive or modify any vesting condition for a Full Value Award after such vesting condition has been established with respect to such Award.

Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, the Participant will be required to pay the Company the aggregate par value of any Shares of restricted stock within ten days of the date of grant, unless such Shares of restricted stock are treasury shares. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, certificates representing Shares of restricted stock granted under the Plan will be held in escrow by the Company on the Participant's behalf during any period of restriction thereon and will bear an appropriate legend specifying the applicable restrictions thereon, and the Participant will be required to execute a blank stock power therefor.
Restricted stock units may be granted without payment of cash or consideration to the Company. Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, on the date the restricted stock units become fully vested and nonforfeitable, the Participant shall receive, upon payment by the Participant to the Company of the aggregate par value of the shares of Common Stock underlying each fully vested restricted stock unit, stock certificates evidencing the conversion of restricted stock units into shares of Common Stock.
Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, with respect to Shares of restricted stock, during such period of restriction the Participant shall have all of the rights of a holder of Common Stock, including but not limited to the rights to receive dividends and to vote, and any stock or other securities received as a distribution with respect to such Participant's Shares of restricted stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as then in effect for the Shares of restricted stock, provided that any dividends on Shares of restricted stock that vest based upon the satisfaction of any performance conditions shall be accumulated and paid at the time the underlying performance conditions are satisfied. Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, with respect to the restricted stock units, during such period of restriction the Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company; provided that, unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, the Participant shall have the right to receive accumulated dividends or distributions with respect to the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock underlying each restricted stock unit at the end of the Vesting Period, unless such restricted stock units are converted into deferred stock units, in which case such accumulated dividends or distributions shall be paid by the Company to the Participant at such time as the deferred stock units are converted into shares of Common Stock.
Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, each unit or Share of restricted stock shall be subject to the termination and forfeiture provisions as set forth in .
Section 6.e
Performance awards may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the size and composition of performance awards granted to a Participant and the appropriate period over which performance is to be measured (a ""). Performance awards may include (i) specific dollar-value target awards (ii) performance units, the value of each such unit being determined by the Committee at the time of issuance, and/or (iii) performance Shares, the value of each such Share being equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock. In any one calendar year, the Committee shall not grant to any one Participant performance awards (i) payable in Common Stock for an amount in excess of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock, or (ii) for performance awards payable in Other Securities or a combination of Common Stock and Other Securities, with a maximum amount payable thereunder of more than the Fair Market Value of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock determined either on the date of grant of the award or the date the award is paid, whichever is greater.
performance cycle
The value of each performance award may be fixed or it may be permitted to fluctuate based on a performance factor (e.g., return on equity) selected by the Committee; provided that, payment of any performance award that is intended to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation 1.162-27(e) shall be based solely on the satisfaction of pre-established, objective goals determined with reference to one or more of the following performance factors: return on equity; earnings per share; return on gross or net assets; return on gross or net revenue; pre- or after-tax net income; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; operating income; revenue growth; consolidated pre-tax earnings; net or gross revenues; net earnings; earnings before interest and taxes; cash flow; earnings per share; fleet in-market availability; safety criteria; environmental criteria; revenue growth; cash flow from operations; diluted or basic; return on sales; earnings per share from continuing operations, diluted or basic; earnings from continuing operations; net asset turnover; capital expenditures; income before income taxes; gross or operating margin; return on total assets; return on invested capital; return on investment; return on revenue; market share; economic value added; cost of capital; expense reduction levels; stock price; productivity; customer satisfaction; employee satisfaction; and total shareholder return for the applicable Performance Period, all as computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (if relevant) as in effect from time to time and as applied by the Company in the preparation of its financial statements and subject to such other special rules and conditions as the Compensation Committee may establish at any time ending on or before the 90th day of the applicable Performance Period. These performance factors may be absolute or relative (to prior performance of the Company or to the performance of one or more other entities or external indices) and may be expressed in terms of a progression within a specified range. The foregoing criteria shall have any reasonable definitions that the Committee may specify, which may include or exclude any or all of the following items, as the Committee may specify: extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items; effects of accounting changes; effects of currency fluctuations; effects of financing activities (e.g., effect on earnings per share of issuing convertible debt securities); expenses for restructuring, productivity initiatives or new business initiatives; non-operating items; acquisition expenses; and effects of divestitures.
The Committee shall establish performance goals and objectives for each performance cycle on the basis of such criteria and objectives as the Committee may select from time to time, including, without limitation, the performance of the Participant, the Company, one or more of its Subsidiaries or divisions or any combination of the foregoing. During any performance cycle, the Committee shall have the authority to adjust the performance goals and objectives for such cycle for such reasons as it deems equitable.
The Committee shall determine the portion of each performance award that is earned by a Participant on the basis of the Company's performance over the performance cycle in relation to the performance goals for such cycle. The earned portion of a performance award may be paid out in Shares, Other Company Securities or any combination thereof, as the Committee may determine.
A Participant must be a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise perform services for, the Company or its Subsidiaries at the end of the performance cycle in order to be entitled to payment of a performance award issued in respect of such cycle; provided, however, unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, each performance award shall be subject to the termination and forfeiture provisions as set forth in .
Section 6.e
Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if there is a Change in Control of the Company, the Committee shall determine the level at which a Participant's performance awards shall become vested upon such Change in Control.
Deferred stock units (A) may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as determined by the Committee, and (B) shall be issued to Participants who elected prior to the date the restricted stock units were granted to defer delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due by virtue of the lapse or waiver of the vesting requirements of their restricted stock units. All elections with respect to deferred stock units shall be made in accordance with the election and distribution timing rules in Code Section 409A.
Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, deferred stock units shall be granted without payment of cash or other consideration to the Company but in consideration of services performed for or for the benefit of the Company or any Subsidiary by such Participant. Payment of the value of deferred stock units shall be made by the Company in shares of Common Stock; provided that, the Participant shall receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of matured or earned deferred stock units. Upon payment in respect of a deferred stock unit, such unit shall be terminated and thereafter forfeited. Payments in respect of deferred stock units shall be made only at the end of the Deferral Period applicable to such units, the duration of which Deferral Period shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant of such deferred stock units and set forth in the applicable Grant Agreement (or by the Participant in the case of an election to defer the receipt of Common Stock beyond the Vesting Period).
Except as otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, during such Deferral Period the Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company; provided that, unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, the Participant shall have the right to receive accumulated dividends or distributions with respect to the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock underlying each deferred stock unit at the end of the Deferral Period when such deferred stock units are converted into shares of Common Stock.
Unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Grant Agreement or related election form, if a Participant dies while serving as a director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiary prior to the end of the Deferral Period, the Participant shall receive payment in respect to such Participant's deferred stock units which would have matured or been earned at the end of such Deferral Period as if the applicable Deferral Period had ended as of the date of such Participant's death.
Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement or related election form, if a Participant ceases to be a director, officer or employee of, or to otherwise perform services for, the Company or its Subsidiaries upon his or her Disability or Retirement prior to the end of the Deferral Period, the Participant shall receive payment in respect of such Participant's deferred stock units at the end of such Deferral Period.
Unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Grant Agreement or related election form, at such time as a Participant ceases to be, or in the event a Participant does not become, a director, officer or employee of, or otherwise performing services for, the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason other than Disability, Retirement or death, such Participant shall immediately forfeit any unvested deferred stock units which would have matured or been earned at the end of such Deferral Period.
The Committee may include in a Participant's Grant Agreement a dividend equivalent right entitling the grantee to receive amounts equal to all or any portion of the dividends that would be paid on the shares of Common Stock covered by such Award if such Shares had been delivered pursuant to such Award. In the event such a provision is included in a Grant Agreement, the Committee shall determine whether such payments shall be made in cash, in shares of Common Stock or in another form, whether they shall be conditioned upon the exercise of the Award to which they relate, the time or times at which they shall be made, and such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate. Any dividend equivalent rights that may be granted on account of Awards that vest based upon the satisfaction of any performance conditions may only be paid if the underlying performance conditions of the Award are satisfied.
(a) . Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participant may elect to deliver shares of Common Stock (or have the Company withhold Shares acquired upon exercise of an option or SAR or deliverable upon grant of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units or deferred stock units or the receipt of Common Stock, as the case may be) to satisfy, in whole or in part, the amount the Company is required to withhold for taxes in connection with the exercise of an option or SAR or the delivery of restricted stock upon grant or vesting or the receipt of Common Stock, as the case may be. Such election must be made on or before the date the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Once made, the election shall be irrevocable. The fair market value of the shares to be withheld or delivered will be the Fair Market Value as of the date the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. In the event a Participant elects to deliver or have the Company withhold shares of Common Stock pursuant to this , such delivery or withholding must be made subject to the conditions and pursuant to the procedures set forth in with respect to the delivery or withholding of Common Stock in payment of the exercise price of options.

Section 6.b.
(b) . The Company may require, as a condition to any grant or exercise under the Plan or to the delivery of certificates for Shares issued hereunder, that the grantee make provision for the payment to the Company, either pursuant to or this , of federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any grant, delivery or vesting of Shares. The Company, to the extent permitted or required by law, shall have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind (including salary or bonus) otherwise due to a grantee, an amount equal to any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any grant or delivery of Shares under the Plan. The Company shall in no event be liable for any taxes whatsoever (including, without limitation, taxes under Code Section 409A) associated with the grant, vesting, exercise, or settlement of any Award granted pursuant to this Plan, other than the Company's share of any payroll taxes.

Section 12.b.
Each employee to whom an Award is made under the Plan shall enter into a Grant Agreement with the Company that shall contain such provisions, including without limitation vesting requirements, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be approved by the Committee. Unless the Committee determines otherwise and except as otherwise provided in in connection with a Change of Control or certain occurrences of termination, no Award under this Plan may be exercised, and no restrictions relating thereto may lapse, within six months of the date such Award is made.
Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10
No Award granted under the Plan shall be transferable by a Participant other than (a) by will or the laws of descent and distribution, (b) to a Participant's Family Member by gift or a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or (c) to a charitable organization, but in each case only with Committee approval or as provided in a Grant Agreement. Unless otherwise provided in any Grant Agreement, an option, SAR or performance award may be exercised only by the optionee or grantee thereof; by his or her Family Member if such person has acquired the option, SAR or performance award by gift or qualified domestic relations order; by the executor or administrator of the estate of any of the foregoing or any person to whom the Option is transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution; or by the guardian or legal representative of any of the foregoing; provided that, Incentive Stock Options may be exercised by any Family Member, guardian or legal representative only if permitted by the Code and any regulations thereunder. All provisions of this Plan shall in any event continue to apply to any Award granted under the Plan and transferred as permitted by this , and any transferee of any such Award shall be bound by all provisions of this Plan as and to the same extent as the applicable original grantee.
Section 14
If the Committee determines that the listing, registration or qualification upon any securities exchange or under any law of Shares subject to any Award is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of same or the issue or purchase of Shares thereunder, no such option or SAR may be exercised in whole or in part, no such performance award, restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit may be paid out, and no Shares may be issued, unless such listing, registration or qualification is effected free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
The transfer of an employee from the Company to a Subsidiary, from a Subsidiary to the Company, or from one Subsidiary to another Subsidiary shall not be considered a termination of employment; nor shall it be considered a termination of employment if an employee is placed on military or sick leave or such other leave of absence which is considered by the Committee as continuing intact the employment relationship.
(a) In the event that any reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation, distribution of assets, or any other change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company affects Shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants under the Plan, the Committee shall make such equitable adjustments in any or all of the following in order to prevent such dilution or enlargement of rights: the number and kind of Shares or other property available for issuance under the Plan (including, without limitation, the total number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan pursuant to ), the number and kind of Awards or other property covered by Awards previously made under the Plan, and the exercise price of outstanding options and SARs. Any such adjustment shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization in which the Company is not the surviving or continuing corporation or in which a Change in Control is to occur, all of the Company's obligations regarding any Awards that were granted hereunder and that are outstanding on the date of such event shall, on such terms as may be approved by the Committee prior to such event, be assumed by the surviving or continuing corporation or canceled in exchange for property (including cash).
Section 4
(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, in connection with any transaction of the type specified by clause (iii) of the definition of a Change in Control in , the Committee may (i) cancel any or all outstanding options under the Plan in consideration for payment to the holders thereof of an amount equal to the portion of the consideration, if any, that would have been payable to such holders pursuant to such transaction if their options had been fully exercised immediately prior to such transaction, less the aggregate exercise price that would have been payable therefor, or (ii) if the amount that would have been payable to the option holders pursuant to such transaction if their options had been fully exercised immediately prior thereto would be equal to or less than the aggregate exercise price that would have been payable therefor, cancel any or all such options for no consideration or payment of any kind. Payment of any amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence may be made in cash or, in the event that the consideration to be received in such transaction includes securities or other property, in cash and/or securities or other property in the Committee's discretion.
Section 2.c.
(c) Change in Control. Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's Grant Agreement, if there is a Change in Control of the Company, all of the Participant's Awards shall become fully vested upon such Change in Control (and, with respect to the Participant's options, exercisable upon such Change in Control and shall remain so until the expiration date of the options), whether or not the Participant is subsequently terminated.
(d) Clawback. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then any Participant who has been paid an Award under this Plan based upon or affected by the restated financial report shall be required, at the discretion of the Board, to reimburse the Company for all or any portion of such Award.
The Board or the Committee, without approval of the shareholders, may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, except that no amendment shall become effective without prior approval of the shareholders of the Company if (i) shareholder approval would be required by applicable law or regulations, including if required by any listing requirement of the principal stock exchange or national market on which the Common Stock is then listed, (ii) such amendment would remove from the Plan a provision which, without giving effect to such amendment, is subject to shareholder approval, or (iii) such amendment would directly or indirectly increase the Share limits set forth in of the Plan.
Section 4
The terms of any outstanding Award under the Plan may be amended from time to time by the Committee in any manner that it deems appropriate (including, but not limited to, acceleration of the date of exercise of any Award and/or payments thereunder or of the date of lapse of restrictions on Shares); provided that, except as otherwise provided in , no such amendment shall adversely affect in a material manner any right of a Participant under the Award without his or her written consent, and provided further that, the Committee shall not reduce the exercise price of any options or SARs awarded under the Plan without approval of the shareholders of the Company. The Committee may, in its discretion, permit holders of Awards under the Plan to surrender outstanding Awards in order to exercise or realize rights under other awards, or in exchange for the grant of new awards, or require holders of Awards to surrender outstanding Awards as a condition precedent to the grant of new awards under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not take any of the following actions without shareholder approval, except as provided in : (i) reduce the exercise price following the grant of an option or SAR; (ii) exchange an option or SAR which has an exercise price that is greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share for cash or Shares or (iii) cancel an option or SAR in exchange for a replacement option or another Award with a lower exercise price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, in no event shall the Committee amend the distribution terms in any Award or Grant Agreement that has a feature for the deferral of compensation if such amendment would result in taxes, additional interest and/or penalties pursuant to Code Section 409A.

The date of commencement of the Plan shall be July 28, 2010.
Unless previously terminated upon the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating the Plan, the Plan shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the earlier of the date that the Plan is adopted or date the of stockholder approval. No termination of the Plan shall materially and adversely affect any of the rights or obligations of any person, without his or her written consent, under any Award or other incentives theretofore granted under the Plan.
Whenever possible, each provision of the Plan shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of the Plan is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of the Plan.
The Plan shall be governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law provisions that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
