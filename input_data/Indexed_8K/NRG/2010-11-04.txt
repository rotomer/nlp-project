Exhibit 99.1
Financial Highlights
Outlook  2010 Updated and 2011 Initiated
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) today reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2010 of $223 million, or $0.87 per diluted common share, compared to $278 million, or $1.02 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2009. Income before taxes was $312 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $444 million in the third quarter of 2009. The $132 million decline in income before taxes is largely driven by a decrease in wholesale results of $89 million, excluding mark-to-market activities, as increased fuel costs led to lower margins.
PRINCETON, NJ; November 4, 2010
Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $491 million, or $1.90 per diluted common share, compared to $908 million, or $3.29 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2009. Year-to-date income before taxes was $762 million in 2010, a decrease of $760 million from the first nine months of 2009. This decline is attributable to lower wholesale gross margins, as generation costs of sales increased by $260 million, a $181 million decrease in gains on open positions and a $128 million gain on the sale of MIBRAG which occurred in the second quarter of 2009.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2,071 million for the first nine months of 2010, $58 million lower than the same period in 2009 at $2,129 million. Reliant Energy contributed $594 million to the 2010 results, compared to $536 million for 2009, the increase largely the result of nine months of ownership in 2010 compared to five months in 2009. The wholesale business was down $116 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared to 2009, mostly due to decreased baseload margins and partially offset by a 2% increase in generation across the fleet.
"NRG continued to deliver strong quarter and year-to-date results in a challenging market environment, proving once again that our Company has the ability to deliver exceptional financial results while positioning the Company to capitalize on the opportunities rising out of the emerging
1
 
clean energy economy," commented David Crane, NRG President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our pending acquisitions of green energy retailer, Green Mountain Energy, and modern combined cycle plants not only will contribute to our platform for future growth, they also will contribute meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow in 2011."

Table 2: Adjusted EBITDA
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $209 million, a decline of $97 million from the third quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven by an $89 million decline in retail gross margin as Mass margins decreased 17% due to lower margins on acquired and renewed customers consistent with competitive offers. Also contributing to lower margins was a 4% decline in Mass volumes sold, primarily due to 84,000 fewer customers.
Reliant Energy:
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $388 million, a $16 million decline compared to $404 million in the third quarter of 2009. Generation increased 4% due to additional wind generation from the South Trent wind farm, which was acquired in June 2010, and the Langford wind farm, which came online in December 2009. Despite the increase in generation, energy
Texas:

margins declined $28 million due to higher fuel and transportation costs at our coal generation facilities.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $105 million, a decrease of $63 million from the third quarter of 2009. Energy margins in the third quarter of 2010 were unfavorable by $53 million as a 33% decline in hedged prices was partially offset by a 37% increase in generation, which was driven by a 64% increase in merchant energy prices and warmer than normal weather. Furthermore, capacity revenues decreased $11 million primarily due to the expiration of the New England RMR contracts on May 31, 2010.
Northeast:
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $39 million, a $35 million increase from the third quarter of 2009. Co-op and long-term contract margins increased $19 million, driven by the addition of a new contract with a regional municipality which led to a 17% increase in megawatt hours (MWh) sold and a 23% increase in the average realized energy price per MWh. The increase in MWh sold was a result of an 8% increase in demand from the legacy contracts due to favorable weather combined with a doubling of the long-term contract load. Also contributing to the improvement were third quarter 2009 unrealized losses related to forward physical power sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Table 3: Corporate Liquidity
In comparison to June 30, 2010, total liquidity, excluding collateral received, at September 30, 2010 increased by $1,255 million to $4,755 million, primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances of $1,279 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents during the quarter resulted from $536 million of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the $1,100 million debt issuance, partially offset by $160 million of capital expenditures and $130 million of stock repurchases. Taking into consideration the pending acquisitions of Green Mountain Energy, the Dynegy assets, and Cottonwood, NRG's pro forma cash balance would be approximately $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2010.
Pending Acquisitions and Repowering Projects
On August 12, 2010, NRG agreed to acquire the Cottonwood Generating Station, a 1,279 megawatt (MW) natural gas-fueled plant in the Entergy zone of east Texas, from Kelson Limited Partnership for $525 million, or $410/kilowatt. The transaction is expected to close by year end, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

NRG signed a definitive agreement with an affiliate of The Blackstone Group L.P. on August 13, 2010 to purchase 3,884 MW of Dynegy Inc. assets in California and Maine for $1.36 billion, or $351/kilowatt. The acquisition is subject to closing conditions, including the completion of Blackstone's separately announced acquisition of Dynegy which itself requires shareholder and regulatory approvals.
On September 16, 2010, NRG announced an agreement to acquire Green Mountain Energy Company, a leading retail provider of clean energy products and services, for $350 million in cash. The transaction, which is expected to close in November, has received regulatory approvals, and remains subject to customary closing conditions.
The El Segundo repowering projecta proposed 550 MW natural gas-fueled combined cycle facility at our existing El Segundo facilityreceived approvals from the California Public Utilities Commission on October 28, 2010 for a 10-year power purchase agreement with Southern California Edison. This approval becomes final and is no longer subject to appeal after 30 days. Construction of the new units is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2011, with a summer 2013 commercial operation date.
Solar Development
NRG's solar development pipeline of over 1,000 MW includes multiple projects and investment opportunities for solar facilities utilizing various technologies that range from concentrated solar thermal to photovoltaic. Progress has been made across our entire solar development portfolio, the most noteworthy of which are as follows:
On September 23, 2010, NRG and Eurus Energy announced a joint venture to build three Avenal photovoltaic solar projectsAvenal Park, Sun City and Sand Drag which will generate a total of 45 MW. All three Avenal projects have a 20-year power purchase agreement with PG&E and are expected to enter into commercial operations in the summer of 2011.
NRG executed a letter of intent with BrightSource Energy, Inc. on October 27, 2010 to construct, finance and operate the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (Ivanpah) with NRG planning to become lead equity investor. Ivanpah will use solar thermal technology in three adjacent but separate facilities in California totaling 392 MW and is expected to be operational by mid-2013. Ivanpah has received a $1.375 billion conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy for a loan guarantee, has obtained all necessary permit and approvals, and has signed multiple 20- to 25-year power purchase agreements with Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.
2010 Share Repurchase Plan Update
The Company repurchased $130 million shares through an accelerated share repurchase agreement with the purchase of 6,249,000 shares at a volume weighted average cost of $20.80 per share. These shares, combined with $50 million repurchased in the second quarter, complete the 2010 share repurchase plan$180 million, or 8.5 million shares, repurchased at an average cost of $21.26.

Tax-Exempt Financing for Indian River Environmental Capital Expenditures
On October 12, 2010, NRG executed a $190 million tax-exempt bond financing through its wholly owned subsidiary, Indian River Power LLC. The bonds were issued by the Delaware Economic Development Authority and will be used to finance a portion of additional emission control equipment at our Indian River facility. The bonds were issued at a rate of 5.375% with a maturity of October 1, 2045, and are supported by a NRG guarantee. The proceeds received on October 12, 2010 were $66 million, with the remaining balance received over time as construction costs are paid.
Outlook for 2010
As a result of continued strong results in the third quarter, we are revising our 2010 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2,500 to $2,550 million. Free cash flow before growth investments is expected to be $1,198 to $1,248 million, an increase of $57 to $107 million over the range of prior guidance. This increase is driven by a reduction of environmental capital expenditures, net as a result of the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to help fund the environmental controls at our Indian River facility. Growth investments for the year are expected to increase as a result of investing in solar projects and procuring long lead time equipment for the El Segundo repowering project.

NRG's initial 2011 adjusted EBITDA guidance is a range of $1,900 to $2,100 million with Reliant Energy contributing $480 to $570 million, Wholesale $1,350 to $1,450 million and Green Mountain $70 to $80 million.

EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.
EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG's business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for gains or losses on the sales of equity method investments; currency loss; Exelon defense costs, and Reliant retail acquisition and integration costs; and factors which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, preferred stock dividends, repowering capital expenditures net of project funding, and NINA Capital Calls and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. Free cash flow before growth investments is used to show NRG's ability to fund certain growth initiatives in addition to debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on free cash flow as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.
