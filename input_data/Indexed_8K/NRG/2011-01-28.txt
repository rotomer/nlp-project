Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 26, 2010, NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG") completed the sale of $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior notes due 2018 (the "Senior Notes") pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement dated January 11, 2011 (the "Purchase Agreement") among NRG, the guarantors named therein, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as the initial purchaser (the "Initial Purchaser").  The Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated February 2, 2006, among NRG and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture, dated January 26, 2011 (the "Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture") among NRG, the guarantors named therein and the Trustee, establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the Senior Notes.  The Forty - -Second Supplemental Indenture and the form of Senior Notes, which is attached as an exhibit to the Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture, provide, among other things, that the Senior Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of NRG.  Interest is payable on the Senior Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2011 until their maturity date of January 15, 2018.
 
The terms of the Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture, among other things, limit the ability of NRG and certain of its subsidiaries to: make restricted payments; restrict dividends or other payments of subsidiaries; incur additional debt; engage in transactions with affiliates; create liens on assets; engage in sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries.
 
The Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture provides for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the indentures; defaults in failure to pay certain other indebtedness; the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.  Generally, if an event of default occurs and is not cured within the time periods specified, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately.
 
The Senior Notes were sold to the Initial Purchaser for resale to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S.  Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement dated January 26, 2011 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") among NRG, the guarantors named therein, and the Initial Purchaser, NRG has agreed to offer to exchange substantially identical senior notes that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the Senior Notes, or, in certain circumstances, to register resales of the Senior Notes.
 
The Senior Notes were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or any state securities laws. Therefore, Senior Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.  This Form 8-K and the Exhibits hereto do not constitute an offer to sell any securities or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities.

Indemnity and Contribution
 
(b)   The Initial Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its principal executive officer or officers, its principal financial officer, its controller or principal accounting officer, and each person if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Initial Purchaser, but only with reference to information relating to the Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company in writing by the Initial Purchaser expressly for use in the any preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Written Information that the Company has used or referred to in connection with the Act or the Final Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto.

(c)   In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel chosen by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this section 7 the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the reasonably incurred fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

Such firm shall be designated in writing by t he Initial Purchaser in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
(d)   To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or Section 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connectio n with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchaser in connection therewith, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchaser and the parties' re lative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e)   The Company and the Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Initial Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwri tten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f)    The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchaser, any person controlling the Initial Purchaser or any affiliate of the Initial Purchaser or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
8.     .  The Initial Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Initial Purchaser to the Company, if  after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the Initial Purchaser's judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package or the Final Memorandum.
Termination
 
9.     .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.  If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchaser because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchaser for all out of pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchaser in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Initial Purchaser
 
10.   .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, purchasers of the Securities (and each employee, representative or other agent of a purchaser) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax structure of any transaction contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the purchasers of the Securities relating to such U.S. tax treatment and U.S tax structure, other than any information for which
Waiver of Tax Confidentiality
nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.
 
11.   .  (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Initial Purchaser with respect to the preparation of any preliminary memorandum, the Disclosure Package, the Final Memorandum, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
 
(b)   The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Initial Purchaser has acted at arms length, is not an agent of, and owes no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Initial Purchaser owes the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Initial Purchaser may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Initial Purchaser arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
 
12.   .  This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

(3)   any Domestic Subsidiary that does not Guarantee any other Indebtedness of the Company subsequently Guarantees other Indebtedness of the Company,

Section 4.18            
Designation of Restricted, Unrestricted and Excluded Project Subsidiaries.
 
The Company may designate, by a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default.  If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the provisions of Section 4.07 hereof or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company.  That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidi ary.  A Responsible Officer of the Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
 
The Company may designate, by a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Excluded Project Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default.  If a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Project Subsidiary is designated as an Excluded Project Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Excluded Project Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the provisions of Section 4.07 hereof or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company.  That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Excluded Project Subsidiary.  A Responsible Officer of the Company may redesignate any Excluded Project Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Project Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
 
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers' Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.07 hereof.  If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary should fail to meet the preceding requirements as, respectively, an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary for the purposes of this Supplement Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Project Subsidiary of the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09 hereof, the Company will be in default of such covenant.  The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09(a) hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

Compensation and Indemnity.
 
(a)   The Company and Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Supplemental Indenture and services hereunder.  The Trustee's compensation will not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.

Section 8.01            
Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

Section 8.02            
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
 
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company and each of the Guarantors shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes (including the Subsidiary Guarantees) on the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, "").  For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes (including the Subsidiary Guarantees), which will thereafter be
Legal Defeasance
deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of the Indenture referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and this Supplemental Indenture and, to the extent applicable, the Base Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
(1)   the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium, if any, and on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 8.04 hereof;

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees, the Company and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of the Indenture and such Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees shall be unaffected thereby.  In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions s et forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(3) and 6.01(4) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.

provided, however
Section 9.01            
Without Consent of Holders of Notes.
 
Notwithstanding Article IX of the Base Indenture and Section 9.02 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Supplemental Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes without the consent of any Holder of Notes:
 
(1)   to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
 
(2)   to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;
 
(3)   to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;
 
(4)   to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under this Supplemental Indenture of any such Holder;
 
(5)   to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Supplemental Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(6)   to conform the text of this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes to any provision of the "Description of the Notes" section of the Company's Offering Memorandum, relating to the initial offering of the Notes, to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes;
 
(7)   to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under this Supplemental Indenture of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof;
 
(8)   to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Supplemental Indenture as of the date hereof; or
 
(9)   to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to the Notes.
 
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 of the Base Indenture the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Supplemental Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture or otherwise.
 
Section 9.02            
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
 
(a)   Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Forty-Second Supplemental Indenture (including, without limitation, Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.14 hereof), the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal aggregate amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Section 6.04 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or interest on the Notes, except a payment default
resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Supplemental Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal aggregate amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes).
Section 2.9 of the Base Indenture shall determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.
 
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.2 of the Base Indenture and Section 9.06 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental indenture.
 
It is not necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver.  Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver.
 
Subject to Section 6.04 hereof and Section 8.2 of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees.  However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
 
(1)     reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
 
(2)     reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described in Section 3.07 hereof);
 
(3)     reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
 
(4)     waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
 
(5)     make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes;
(6)     make any change in the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium on the Notes;
 
(7)     waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described in Section 3.07 hereof; or
 
(8)     make any change in Section 9.02 hereof or Section 9.2 of the Base Indenture, as to the Notes, or in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
 
(b)   Other than as expressly provided in Section 9.02 above, the Base Indenture may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified as and to the extent provided in the Base Indenture.
 
Section 9.03            
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
 
Every amendment or supplement to this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
 
Section 9.04            
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
 
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note.  However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.  An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
 
Section 9.05            
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
 
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated.  The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
Section 9.06            
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
 
The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.  The Company may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors of the Company approves it.  In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.1 of the Base Indenture) will be fully protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by the Indenture.
Section 10.01           Guarantee
.
 
(a)   Subject to this Article 10, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
 
(1)   the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
 
(2)   in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
 
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.  Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
 
(b)   The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.  Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obl igations contained in the Notes and the Indenture.
 
(c)   If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
(d)   Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee.  The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.
Section 10.02           Limitation
on Guarantor Liability.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
Section 10.03          
Execution and Delivery of Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Supplemental Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by one of its Officers.
 
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 10.01 will remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
If an Officer whose signature is on this Supplemental Indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee will be valid nevertheless.
 
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, will constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
 
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any Domestic Subsidiary after the Issue Date, if required by Section 4.17 hereof, the Company shall cause such Domestic Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of Section 4.17 hereof and this Article 10, to the extent applicable.
 
Section 10.04           Guarantors
May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.05 hereof, no Guarantor may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Company or another Guarantor, unless:
 
(1)   immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
 
(2)   either:
 
(a)   subject to Section 10.05 hereof, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement and its Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to supplemental agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;
(b)   the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, including without limitation, Section 4.10 hereof; or
 
(c)   immediately after giving effect to that transaction, such Person qualifies as an Excluded Subsidiary.
 
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Supplemental Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor.  Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee.  All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit un der this Supplemental Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued on the Issue Date.
 
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Supplemental Indenture or in any of the Notes will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
 
Section 10.05           Releases

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)   Each of the Issuers jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement, the Initial Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer, and their respective affiliates and each person who controls any such Holder, Initial Purchaser, Exchanging Dealer or affiliate within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims,
 
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse eac h such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Issuers will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein.  This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Issuers may otherwise have.
provided
however
 
Each of the Issuers also jointly and severally agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their respective affiliates, and each person who controls such underwriter or affiliate on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchaser and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof.
 
(b)   Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including the Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls any Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have.
 
(c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense
 
to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the initiation of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided, however
 
(d)   In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shal l the Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security, or in the case of a New Security, applicable to the Security that was exchangeable into such New Security, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerat ions.  Benefits received by the Issuers shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum.  Benefits received by the Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions as
Losses
provided
however
 
set forth on the cover page of the Final Memorandum, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities or New Securities, as applicable, registered under the Act.  Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.   The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls any Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of any Issuer who shall have signed the Regi stration Statement and each director of any Issuer shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuers, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
(e)   The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Issuers or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
 
7.             .
Underwritten Registrations
 
(a)   If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders.
 
(b)   No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
 
8.             .  If any of the following events (each, a "") shall occur, then the Issuers shall pay liquidated damages (the "") to the Holders of Securities in respect of the Securities as follows:
Registration Defaults
Registration Default
Special Interest
 
(a)   if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such filing in this Agreement;
 
(b)   if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date specified to cause such effectiveness under this Agreement;
 
(c)   if the Issuers fail to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer within 30 Business Days of the date specified for such effectiveness with respect to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement; or
 
(d)   if the Shelf Registration Statement or the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of Registrable Securities during the periods specified in this Agreement,
 
then, in each case, as of the date any such event occurs, Special Interest shall accrue on the Registrable Securities at a rate of .25% per annum of the principal amount of Registrable Securities outstanding for the first 90 days from and including such date; thereafter, the Special Interest will increase by an additional .25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum amount of 1.0% per annum of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding.  All accrued Special Interest will be paid by the Issuer on the next scheduled interest payment date to DTC or its nominee by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check and to holders of certificated notes by wire transfer to the accounts specified by them or by mailing checks to their registered addresses if no such accounts have been specified.& #160; A Registration Default shall have been cured for purposes hereof (1) upon the filing of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (a) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (b) above), (3) upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (in the case of paragraph (c) above), or (4) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of paragraph (d) above).  Immediately upon the cure of all Registration Defaults, the accrual of Special Interest will cease.
 
9.             .  No Issuer has, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it, on or after the date hereof, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
 
10.           .  The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Issuers have obtained the written consent of the Majority Holders; that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of the Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Issuers shall obtain the written consent of the Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective; , , that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and , , that the provisions of this

Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
NEWS
RELEASE
PRINCETON, NJ; January 26, 2011
NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG), today announced the successful early tender results of its previously announced cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding 7.250% senior notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes").  The tender offer includes a concurrent consent solicitation respecting indenture amendments that would significantly modify and remove certain restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 2014 Notes.  The table below sets forth the results of the tender offer and consent solicitation for the 2014 Notes, according to information provided by the depositary, as of the early tender and consent deadline of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 25, 2011.
 
 
Based on such tenders and separate consents delivered, the proposed amendments have been approved.  2014 Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the tender offer and consent solicitation will not have the benefit of certain provisions presently in the indenture governing the 2014 Notes, possibly increasing the investment risks associated with the notes and making them less attractive as an investment.
 
The offer to purchase expires at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on February 8, 2011, unless extended by NRG or earlier terminated (as it may be amended, the "expiration time").  Holders who do not wish to retain the 2014 Notes that will not have the benefit of the existing restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 2014 Notes should tender their notes prior to the expiration time.
 
The early tender and consent deadline, which was also the withdrawal and revocation deadline, has passed.  As a result, validly tendered notes and validly delivered consents may no longer be withdrawn or revoked and holders who validly tender additional notes prior to the expiration time will receive $1,000.63 per $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes, the applicable tender offer consideration.  Holders who deliver additional separate consents prior to the expiration time will receive no additional consideration.
 
 
The proposed amendments will become effective only if we accept for purchase and pay for all 2014 Notes that are validly tendered for purchase in the tender offer at or prior to the expiration time, and pay the consent fee to all holders eligible to receive it in connection with the consent solicitation.  NRG intends to redeem any 2014 Notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the tender offer as promptly as practicable after the expiration date in accordance with the terms of the indenture, as such indenture is amended pursuant to the proposed amendments.
