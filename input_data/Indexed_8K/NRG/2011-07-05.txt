Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing (in lieu of interest which would otherwise become due to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.06) or (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error).

Change in Legality
 
(i)            such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
 
(ii)           such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans
 
that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.  Any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan under (i) above shall be subject to Section 2.16.
(b)
          
For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

Indemnity
.

In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include, in the case of a Lender, an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Eurodollar Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period.

Participations
.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower (or, if applicable, another party pursuant to its obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date due as provided in Section 2.02(f).  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section 2.23(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

Reimbursement

Obligations Absolute
.  The Borrower's obligations to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in Section 2.23(e) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:

any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;
 
(ii)
          
any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document;

(iv)
         
any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Bank, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrower hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.  However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit (A) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of
 
Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (B) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.

The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the applicable Revolving Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Revolving Lender notice thereof.

Interim Interest
.

At the time such removal or resignation shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii).  The acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the resignation or removal of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or removal, but, after receipt by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower of notice of resignation from an Issuing Bank or after the receipt by an Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of notice of removal from the Borrower, as applicable, such Issuing Bank
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or increase the amount of Letters of Credit then outstanding.

Cash Collateralization
.  If any Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII shall occur and be continuing, or the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated and/or the Commitments have been terminated, the Borrower shall, on the Business Day it receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Majority Revolving Lenders thereof and of the amount to be deposited, deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure, an amount in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date.  Such deposit shall be held, upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower with respect to Letters of Credit under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in Cash Equivalents, which investments shall be made by the Administrative Agent in accordance with its internal policies applied to transactions of the size and nature provided for in the Loan Documents, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans, and/or termination of the Commitments, moneys in such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Majority Revolving Lenders), be applied to satisfy the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article VII, or acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and/or termination of the Commitments, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all such Events of Default have been cured or waived.

Additional Issuing Banks
.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of the Agreement.  Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this Section 2.23(k) shall be deemed to be an "Issuing Bank" (in addition to being a Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and, with respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Lender.

(a)
          
if any Swingline Exposure or Revolving L/C Exposure exists at the time such Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then so long as such Swingline Exposure or Revolving L/C Exposure exists, all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and Revolving L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall automatically, for so long as such Swingline Exposure and Revolving L/C Exposure is outstanding, be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders' Revolving Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and Revolving L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders' Revolving Commitments; that neither such reallocation nor any payment by a non-Defaulting Revolving Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to no longer be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
 
(b)

(c)
          
in furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower (which authorization is irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to give, in its discretion, through the Administrative Agent, a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 2.03 in such amounts and in such times as may be required to (i) reimburse an outstanding L/C Disbursement, (ii) repay an outstanding Swingline Loan and/or (iii) cash collateralize the obligations of the Borrower in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of the obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan;
(d)
          
so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender has a good faith and reasonable belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations generally under other agreements in which it commits to extend credit, then (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew, increase or extend any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders
and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with clauses (a) and (b) above, and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (a) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein) and (ii) the Swingline Lender may, upon prior written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, resign as Swingline Lender, effective at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be less than 30 days after the date of such notice); that such resignation by the Swingline Lender will have no effect on its rights in respect of any outstanding Swingline Loans or on the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender under this Agreement with respect to any such outstanding Swingline Loan; and
provided
 
(e)
          
any amount paid by the Borrower or otherwise received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account until (subject to the last paragraph of this Section 2.26) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder and will be applied by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement; , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender ( as to the respective amounts owing to each of them) under this Agreement; , to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Lenders hereunder other than Defaulting Lenders, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them; , to the payment of fees then due and payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them; , to pay principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due and payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder ratably in accordance with the amounts thereof then due and payable to them; , to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders; and, , after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then
the Administrative Agent shall so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in Section 2.26(e)), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par such portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Exposure, Revolving L/C Exposure and Swingline Exposure of the Revolving Lenders to be held in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentage in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will be a non-Defaulting Lender (and such Revolving Exposure, Revolving L/C Exposure and Swingline Exposure of each Revolving Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to
reflect the foregoing); that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and , , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.

For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.01, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in Sections 6.01(b)(i) through 6.01(b)(xxi), or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the Borrower shall be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 6.01.  Indebtedness under this Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will initially be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by Section 6.01(b)(i).  The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 6.01; , in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in the Fixed Charges of the Borrower as accrued.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be (i) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount; (ii) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (iii) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of (x) the Fair Market Value of such asset at the date of determination and (y) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; that any changes in any of the above shall not give rise to a default under this Section 6.01.

Designation of Restricted, Unrestricted and Excluded Project Subsidiaries
.  (a)  The Borrower may designate, by a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Subsidiary constituting or owning Core Collateral and other than the Funded L/C SPV) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default or Event of Default.  If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the provisions of Section 6.06 or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Borrower.  That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.  A Responsible Officer of the Borrower may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default or Event of Default.
 
(b)
                                
The Borrower may designate, by a certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Excluded Project Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default or Event of Default.  If a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Project Subsidiary is designated as an Excluded Project Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Excluded Project Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the provisions of Section 6.06 or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Borrower.  That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Excluded Project Subsidiary.  A Responsible Officer of the Borrower may redesignate any Excluded Project Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary that is not an Excluded Project Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default or Event of Default.
 
(c)
                                 
Any designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Administrative Agent by delivering to the Administrative Agent a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers' Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 6.06.  If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary should fail to meet the preceding requirements as, respectively, an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary for the purposes of this Agreement and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary or an Excluded Project Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 6.01, the Borrower will be in default of such covenant.  The Board of Directors of the Borrower may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Project Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (i) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 6.01(a), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference period and (ii) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents are hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders to execute any and all documents (including releases and documents pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement and the other Security Documents) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably (a) acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral Trustee (as defined in each of the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement) has been appointed as the Secured Parties' agent in respect of the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement and the other Security Documents, in each case as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents and (b) expressly authorizes and directs the Collateral Trustee (as defined in each of
Agents
 
the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement) to execute such documents or instruments as may be required or contemplated by the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement, the Collateral Trust Agreement and the other Security Documents, in each case, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents.  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby agrees to be bound by the priority of the security interests and allocation of the benefits of the Collateral and proceeds thereof set forth in the Security Documents.  In addition, each of the Lenders acknowledges the Credit Agreement Parallel Debt (as defined in each of the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement) that has been created in the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement in favor of the Collateral Trustee (as defined in each of the Existing Collateral Trust Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement).
 
Each institution serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the Required Lenders determine that the Person serving as Administrative Agent is (without taking into account any provision in the definition of "Defaulting Lender" requiring notice from the Administrative Agent or any other party) a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders (determined after giving effect to Section 9.08) may, by notice to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a replacement Administrative Agent hereunder.  Such removal will, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, be effective on the earlier of (a) the date a replacement Administrative Agent is appointed and (b) the date 30 days after the giving of such notice by the Required Lenders (regardless of whether a replacement Administrative Agent has been appointed).
 
No Agent or Lender shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) none of any Agent, the Syndication Agent, any Documentation Agent, any Arranger or any Lender shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and, in performing its functions and duties hereunder, each Agent shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders, the Majority Revolving Lenders, the Majority Term Lenders or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08, as applicable, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose it to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Bankruptcy Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Bankruptcy Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as any Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it under or in connection with any Loan Document except to the extent caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
provided
judgment.  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
 
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. 
Any resignation pursuant to this paragraph by a Person acting as the Administrative Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its affiliates of any obligation to advance, make or extend Swingline Loans where such advance, making or extension is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. 
Upon any such resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject to the Borrower's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and, if applicable, the Swingline Lender, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, including its duties and obligations in its capacity as a Swingline Lender, and such successor, in its capacity as the Swingline Lender, shall
enter into an Assignment and Acceptance and acquire from the retiring Agent, in its capacity as a Swingline Lender, each outstanding Swingline Loan of such retiring Agent for a purchase price equal to par plus accrued interest
.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of
such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent.
 
Each of the Syndication Agent, each Documentation Agent and each Arranger, in each case, in its capacity as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents, the Arrangers, or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax.  If
any payment has been made to any Lender by the Administrative Agent without the applicable withholding Tax being withheld from such payment and the Administrative Agent has paid over the applicable withholding Tax to the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority, or
the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
PRINCETON, NJ; July 5, 2011
NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG: NYSE) has concluded the refinancing of $3.9 billion of its first lien facilities. The first lien structure now includes a $2.3 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2016 and $1.6 billion Term Loan B facility maturing in 2018.
 
NRG's new revolving credit facility will be used to provide for NRG's letter of credit (LC) requirements and also serves as a source of additional cash liquidity. The new Term Loan B facility refinances two existing term loan tranches with a single facility maturing in 2018.
 
"With this refinancing, NRG has significantly extended its maturity profile, with all recourse debt now maturing after 2016," said Christian Schade, NRG's Chief Financial Officer. "Through this process we have also better aligned a more simplified covenant structure across our first lien and more recently issued senior note indentures. Our expectation is for these structures to allow for more flexibility to provide greater return of capital to all stakeholders."
 
The highlights of the refinancing include:
 
                 
The new $2.3 billion revolving credit facility due 2016 replaces $1 billion revolver due 2015 and $1.3 billion Term LC facility.
                 
The new $1.6 billion Term Loan B due 2018 replaces a $1 billion Term Loan B due 2013 and a $600 million due 2015.
                 
Simplified first lien covenant structure includes removal of investment basket restrictions and cash flow sweep mechanism permitting a more efficient allocation of capital.
 
Also, as part of the refinancing, NRG recently completed the previously announced tender and redemption of its 7.375% senior notes due in 2016. The refinancing of those senior notes is part of an ongoing strategy to achieve greater covenant relief to be concluded once outstanding senior notes due in 2017 are redeemed.
