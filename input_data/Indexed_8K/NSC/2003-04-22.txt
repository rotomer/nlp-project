Martin Title: Corporate Secretary Date: April 23, 2003 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number System Description 99 On April 23, 2003, the Registrant issued a press release, attached hereto as an Exhibit 99, announcing first-quarter 2003 results.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 23, 2003 NORFOLK SOUTHERN REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER 2003 RESULTS For the first quarter of 2003 vs. the same period of 2002: * Railway operating revenues set a first quarter record, increasing 4 percent to $1.56 billion. * General merchandise revenues climbed 6 percent on strength of automotive and agricultural shipments. * Intermodal revenues rose 7 percent bolstered by increased international container business. * Earnings per share from continuing operations, before accounting changes, were $0.22 per diluted share. NEW YORK, NY -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported first quarter income from continuing operations, before required accounting changes, of $85 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $86 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier. First-quarter net income was $209 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, and included a $114 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, gain largely due to a required change in accounting for the cost of removing railroad crossties, and a $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, gain from discontinued operations resulting from the 1998 sale of a former motor carrier subsidiary. "We are pleased to report a solid quarter with the highest railway operating revenues of any first quarter in Norfolk Southern's history, which was achieved during a period of continuing economic slowness," said David R. Goode, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are intensely focused on diverting freight traffic from the highways to the rails, reducing debt and costs, and strategically positioning Norfolk Southern to capture the opportunities for business growth as the economy rebounds." Railroad operating revenues during the first-quarter were $1.56 billion, 4 percent higher than first-quarter 2002, while carloads rose 3 percent, compared to the same period in 2002. General merchandise revenues of $918 million also set a first-quarter record, climbing 6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. All general merchandise commodity groups exceeded first quarter 2002 results. Automotive revenues of $242 million surpassed first quarter 2002 results by 6 percent, while carloads increased 2 percent over the similar period last year. Agriculturalrevenues increased $12 million, or 8 percent, and were the highest for any quarter. Intermodal revenues during the first quarter increased 7 percent to $289 million, compared to the same period of 2002, primarily as a result of strong international business. Container volume increased by more than 31,000 units, or 8 percent, while container revenues climbed 12 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. First-quarter coal revenues declined one percent to $354 million, compared to the same period a year earlier, largely as a result of decreased demand for industrial and metallurgical coal. Railway operating expenses were $1.33 billion for the quarter, a 5 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2002. The increase was largely due to higher diesel fuel prices and severe winter weather conditions in Norfolk Southern's operating territory. For the quarter, the railway operating ratio, the percentage of revenues required to operate the railroad, was 85.2 percent compared to 84.2 percent a year earlier. Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates 21,500 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers. NS operates the East's most extensive intermodal network and is the nation's largest rail carrier of automotive parts and finished vehicles. # # # Media Contact: Bob Fort, Norfolk, 757-629-2710 Investor Contact: Leanne McGruder, Norfolk, 757-629-2861 Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) ($ millions except per share) Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------ 2003 2002 ---- ---- Railway operating revenues: Coal $ 354 $ 359 General merchandise 918 869 Intermodal 289 270 ------- ------- TOTAL RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES 1,561 1,498 ------- ------- Railway operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 526 523 Materials, services and rents 360 339 Conrail rents and services 107 113 Depreciation 127 127 Diesel fuel 104 81 Casualties and other claims 51 35 Other 55 43 ------- ------- TOTAL RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES 1,330 1,261 ------- ------- Income from railway operations 231 237 Other income -

--------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - First-quarter 2003 results include an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share, related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. This change in accounting lowered depreciation expense and increased compensation and benefits expenses and other expenses for the first quarter of 2003. The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003,and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. This entity's assets and liabilities consist of the locomotives and debt related to their purchase. This change in accounting resulted in higher depreciation and interest expense for the quarter (to reflect the locomotives as owned assets) and lower lease expense; however, the net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. 3. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - A bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement, and therefore not included in "Accounts receivable - net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $0 million at March 31, 2003, and $30 million at Dec. 31, 2002. 4. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments is borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash provided by financing activities" and totaled $80 million in the first quarter of 2003 and $66 million in the first quarter of 2002.
