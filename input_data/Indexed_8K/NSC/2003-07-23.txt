FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 23, 2003 Norfolk Southern Reports Second-Quarter, First-Half Results For the second quarter of 2003 vs. the same period of 2002: - Net income rose 15 percent to $137 million. - Coal revenues climbed 11 percent on increased utility coal shipments. - Railway operating revenues set an all-time record of $1.63 billion, up 3 percent. - Income from railway operations declined 7 percent to $298 million. - Earnings per diluted share improved 13 percent to $0.35. - The operating ratio increased to 81.8 percent. NEW YORK, NY -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported second-quarter net income of $137 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, an increase of 15 percent, compared with net income of $119 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2002. "We produced better results despite continued economic slowness in the quarter and considerable downward pressure on general merchandise traffic," said David R. Goode, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The quality of our transportation continues to improve due to the strength of our operating plan and our ability to operate a high-service railroad in a tough economy." For the first six months, net income from continuing operations, before required accounting changes,was $222 million, or $0.57 per diluted share compared with net income of $205 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, during the same period of 2002. Net income for the first six months was $346 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, and included a $114 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, gain largely due to a required change in accounting for the cost of removing railroad crossties, and a $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, gain from discontinued operations resulting from the 1998 sale of a former motor carrier subsidiary. Second-quarter railway operating revenues of $1.63 billion were the highest of any quarter in Norfolk Southern's history and improved 3 percent compared with $1.59 billion in the second quarter of 2002. Railway operating revenues for the first half of 2003 also set a six-month record rising 3 percent to $3.19 billion compared with $3.09 billion for the same period a year earlier. Coal revenues in the second quarter climbed 11 percent to $389 million compared with second quarter 2002. The growth was driven by an increase in utility shipments as power companies replenished stockpiles. For the first half, coal revenues improved 5 percent to $743 million compared to the same period a year earlier as the result of stronger electricity production due to seasonable weather conditions in Norfolk Southern's service region. Intermodal revenues set records rising 2 percent to $300 million in the second quarter and 4 percent to $589 million for the first six months compared with the same periods of 2002. The growth was the result of strong international business and the successful conversion of new truck-competitive, transcontinental interline services. Second-quarter general merchandise revenues of $944 million were down slightly compared to second quarter 2002, particularly in the automotive, metals and construction and chemical commodity sectors. For the first six months, general merchandise revenues increased 2 percent to $1.86 billion compared with the year-earlier period. Agricultural revenues, strengthened by fertilizer and grain shipments, posted the largest gain, growing by 12 percent in the quarter and 9 percent for the first six months, compared to the same periods a year ago. In addition, paper and forest products revenues grew by 6 percent for both the second quarter and the first six months compared with the same periods of 2002. Railway operating expenses increased 5 percent for both the second quarter and the first six months of 2003 compared with the same periods last year. These increases primarily were due to increased compensation and benefits, higher diesel fuel costs and increased casualty and other claims costs. For the quarter, the railway operating ratio, the percentage of revenues required to operate the railroad, was 81.8 percent compared with 79.8 percent in the same period of 2002. For the first six months, the operating ratio was 83.4 percent, compared with 81.9 during the same period of 2002. Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates 21,500 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers. NS operates the East's most extensive intermodal network and is the nation's largest rail carrier of automotive parts and finished vehicles. ### Media Contact: Bob Fort, Norfolk, 757-629-2710 Investor Contact: Leanne McGruder, Norfolk, 757-629-2861 Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) ($ millions except per share) Three Months Ended June 30, ------------------ 2003 2002 ---- ---- Railway operating revenues: Coal $ 389 $ 350 General merchandise 944 948 Intermodal 300 295 ------- ------- TOTAL RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES 1,633 1,593 ------- ------- Railway operating expenses: Compensation and benefits 535 497 Materials, services and rents 377 364 Conrail rents and services 102 103 Depreciation 129 129 Diesel fuel 93 84 Casualties and other claims 47 37 Other 52 57 ------- ------- TOTAL RAILWAY OPERATING EXPENSES 1,335 1,271 ------- ------- Income from railway operations 298 322 Other income -

--------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - First-quarter 2003 results included an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share, related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. This change in accounting lowered 2003 depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate for crossties no longer reflects costs to remove) and increased compensation and benefits expenses (for the costs to remove retired assets). The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. This entity's assets and liabilities consist of the locomotives and debt related to their purchase. This change in accounting increased depreciation and interest expense in 2003 (to reflect the locomotives as owned assets) and lowered lease expense. The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. 3. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - A bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement, and therefore not included in "Accounts receivable - net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $0 at June 30, 2003, and $30 million at Dec. 31, 2002. 4. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments is borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $105 million in the first half of 2003 and $98 million in the first half of 2002.
