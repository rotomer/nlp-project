FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE OCTOBER 29, 2003 NORFOLK SOUTHERN REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER 2003 RESULTS For the third quarter of 2003 vs. the same period of 2002: * Net income rose 9 percent to $137 million. * Intermodal revenues set an all-time record of $315 million. * The railway operating ratio was 80.5 percent. * Earnings per diluted share increased to $0.35. NEW YORK, N.Y. -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported third-quarter net income of $137 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with net income of $126 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2002. "Despite a challenging environment, we managed to improve our net income and earnings per share and at the same time post the best operating performance metrics in our history, positioning ourselves for the future by improving service consistency, asset utilization and efficiency," said David R. Goode, chairman, president and chief executive officer. For the first nine months, income from continuing operations, before required accounting changes, was $359 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared with net income of $331 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year. Net income during the first nine months was $483 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, and included a $114 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, gain largely due to a required change in accounting for the cost of removing railroad crossties, and a $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, gain from discontinued operations resulting from the 1998 sale of a former motor carrier subsidiary. Third-quarter railway operating revenues of $1.60 billion were even with third quarter 2002. Year-to-date railway operating revenues of $4.79 billion were up $103 million, or two percent, compared to the same period a year earlier and established a new nine-month record. Intermodal revenues in 2003 set a third-quarter record at $315 million and also a record for the first nine months, increasing three percent to $904 million compared to the same period a year earlier. The revenue growth reflects increases in converting traffic from the highway to the railroad. Coal revenues improved slightly to $372 million in the quarter and increased three percent to $1.12 billion for the first nine months compared to the same period a year earlier, primarily due to increases in utility and export coal shipments. Third-quarter general merchandise revenues declined one percent to $911 million compared to the same period of 2002. Automotive revenues decreased 11 percent, primarily due to slowed manufacturing and model changeovers, while agricultural, paper and forest products and chemicals reported increased revenues. For the first nine months, general merchandise revenues rose one percent to $2.77 billion compared with the year-earlier nine-month period. Railway operating expenses for the quarter remained unchanged at $1.29 billion compared to third quarter 2002 but were up three percent to $3.95 billion for the first nine months compared to the same period last year largely due to lower pension income and increases in employee wages and medical benefits, as well as higher diesel fuel prices. For the quarter, the railway operating ratio remained unchanged at 80.5 percent compared with the same period of 2002. For the first nine months, the operating ratio rose from 81.4 percent to 82.5 percent. Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates 21,500 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers.

---------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - First-quarter 2003 results included an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share, related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. This change in accounting lowered 2003 depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate for crossties no longer reflects costs to remove) and increased compensation and benefits expenses (for the costs to remove retired assets). The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. This entity's assets and liabilities consist of the locomotives and debt related to their purchase. This change in accounting increased depreciation and interest expense in 2003 (to reflect the locomotives as owned assets) and lowered lease expense. The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. 3. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - A bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement, and therefore not included in "Accounts receivable - net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $0 at Sept. 30, 2003, and $30 million at Dec. 31, 2002. 4. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments is borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $174 million in the first nine months of 2003 and $162 million in the first nine months of 2002.
