NORFOLK SOUTHERN SAYS IMPACT OF STB RULING ON EARNINGS CANNOT  BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME
NORFOLK, VA -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) has reviewed the Surface Transportation Board's ruling in that upheld the Company's rates on certain coal movements.  However in the ruling, the Surface Transportation Board invited Duke Energy to initiate a proceeding to determine whether the phase-in constraints of the Constrained Market Pricing Guidelines should apply.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the impact of the decision on its earnings at this time.    
Duke Energy Corp. v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company
Norfolk Southern will continue to monitor future developments in the case and evaluate their financial impact.  At this time, Norfolk Southern is continuing to bill and collect amounts based on the challenged tariff rates consistent with its past practice.  Due to the passage of time, however, the ultimate outcome could have a significant effect on the results of operations in the particular quarter or year resolved.
