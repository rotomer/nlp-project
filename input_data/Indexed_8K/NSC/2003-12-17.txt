NORFOLK SOUTHERN TO RECORD CHARGE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSETS
NORFOLK, VA - - Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) announced today that it will record a pre-tax charge of approximately $80 million to its fourth-quarter earnings to recognize the impaired value of certain telecommunications assets. This charge will reduce fourth-quarter net income by approximately $50 million or 13 cents per share.
"This charge recognizes the reduced value of telecommunications assets based on prevailing market conditions in the telecommunications industry as reflected by a recent valuation study," said David Goode, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Norfolk Southern, through its T-Cubed subsidiary, remains committed to its participation in the telecommunications industry, which allows us to leverage our assets to participate in the future development of telecommunications infrastructure."
Norfolk Southern owns Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, known as T-Cubed. T-Cubed's assets include 1,600 miles of fiber-optic infrastructure on Norfolk Southern's eastern rail corridors, and it has completed a number of transactions to provide infrastructure to telecommunications service providers.
