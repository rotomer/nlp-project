ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Item 9.            Regulation FD Disclosure and Item 12.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
                        On January 28, 2004, the Registrant issued a Press Release, attached hereto as an Exhibit 99.  The press release, which reports fourth quarter and 2003 results, includes a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by SEC Regulation G, which is reconciled within the release.  Specifically, the release refers to fourth quarter net income excluding an after-tax charge for a voluntary separation program and an after-tax charge to recognize the impaired value of certain telecommunication assets.  This measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Management believes that net income excluding these two charges may be more indicative of operating results when compared to prior periods and to other companies, and it intends to use this non-GAAP financial measure for comparison purposes at its analysts' meeting scheduled today and in future comparisons to this period.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 28, 2004 NORFOLK SOUTHERN REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND 2003 RESULTS For the fourth quarter of 2003: - Railway operating revenues increased six percent to a record $1.68 billion. - Net income was $52 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. - Net income included two charges: 1) $66 million, or $0.17 per share for the cost of the voluntary separation program; and 2) $53 million or $0.13 per share for the write down of certain telecommunications assets. The two charges reduced net income by $119 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of these items, fourth-quarter net income would have been $171 million, or $0.43 per share. For the year 2003: - Railway operating revenues increased three percent to a record $6.5 billion. - Net income was $535 million, or $1.37 per diluted share. NEW YORK, N.Y. - Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported fourth-quarter net income of $52 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, impacted by two significant charges - a $66 million or $0.17 per share after-tax charge for a voluntary separation program and a $53 million or $0.13 per share after-tax charge to recognize the impaired value of certain telecommunications assets. Excluding the effects of these items, fourth-quarter net income would have been $171 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with net income of $129 million or $0.33 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. "We are pleased with fourth-quarter results, which were substantially better than a year ago, demonstrating success at growing our revenue base and improving productivity," said David R. Goode, chairman, president and chief executive officer. Net income for 2003 was $535 million, or $1.37 per share, and included a $114 million, or $0.29 per share, gain largely due to a required change in accounting for the cost of removing railroad crossties, a $10 million, or $0.03 per share, gain from discontinued operations resulting from the 1998 sale of a former motor carrier subsidiary, and the two fourth quarter after-tax charges. Excluding the effect of all four of these items, net income for the year would have been $530 million or $1.35 per share. Railway operating revenues were the highest of any quarter and year in Norfolk Southern's history. Fourth-quarter revenues were $1.68 billion, up six percent compared with the same period a year earlier. For the year, revenues rose to $6.5 billion, three percent higher compared with 2002 results. Fourth-quarter general merchandise revenues improved five percent to $956 million compared to the same period of 2002 and set a quarterly record. All of the market groups reported gains, led by metals and construction and agriculture. For the year, general merchandise revenues were $3.7 billion, up two percent compared with 2002, and established an annual record. Intermodal revenues posted records for both the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, revenues climbed to $335 million, up nine percent compared to the same period a year earlier. For the year, intermodal revenues were $1.2 billion, up five percent compared to 2002. Coal revenues increased seven percent in the fourth quarter to $385 million, benefiting primarily from favorable developments in the coal rate reasonableness proceedings in which two utilities challenged tariff rates in place since early 2002. For the year, coal revenues rose four percent compared to 2002 to $1.5 billion. Railway operating expenses in the quarter were $1.5 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to fourth quarter 2002, primarily as a result of the $107 million charge for the voluntary separation program. For the year, railroad operating expenses were $5.4 billion, an increase of six percent compared to the same period a year earlier, again reflecting the charge for the fourth quarter voluntary separation program. For the quarter, the railway operating ratio increased to 86.6 percent compared with 81.8 percent in the same period of 2002. For the year, the operating ratio increased to 83.5 percent, compared with 81.5 percent a year earlier. Without the cost of the voluntary separation program, the fourth-quarter ratio would have been 80.3 percent and the ratio for the year would have been 81.9 percent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. VOLUNTARY SEPARATION - Fourth-quarter 2003 results included $107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program, which reduced net income by $66 million, or 17 cents per share. Through the program, 553 nonagreement employees were separated from service, of which 314 retired under NS' retirement plan. The costs include $66 million for separation payments and other benefits of the program and $41 million of costs related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 2. ASSET IMPAIRMENT - Fourth-quarter 2003 results included an $84 million charge to recognize the impaired value of certain telecommunications assets, which reduced net income by $53 million, or 13 cents per share. As a result of a deterioration in the long-term prospects for these assets, an updated appraisal obtained in the fourth quarter indicated a significant decline in their value. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - First-quarter 2003 results included an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share, related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 4. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. This change in accounting lowered 2003 depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate for crossties no longer reflects costs to remove) and increased compensation and benefits expenses (for the costs to remove retired assets). The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. This entity's assets and liabilities at Jan. 1, 2003, included $169 million of locomotives and $157 million of debt related to their purchase, as well as a $6 million minority interest liability. This change in accounting increased depreciation and interest expense in 2003 (to reflect the locomotives as owned assets) and lowered lease expense. The net effect on total railway operating expenses and net income was not material. 5. SALES OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - A bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary of NS sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable sold under this arrangement, and therefore not included in "Accounts receivable - net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $0 at Dec. 31, 2003, and $30 million at Dec. 31, 2002. 6. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments is borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The net borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $203 million in 2003 and $212 million in 2002.
