                    NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (herein called the "Corporation", which term includes any successor corporation under the Base Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to ___________________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of ________________ Dollars ($________) on September 17, 2014 and to pay interest thereon from September 17, 2004 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on March 17 and September 17 of each year, commencing March 17, 2005, at a rate of 5.257% per annum until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and on any overdue principal and premium, if any, at a rate of 5.257% per annum and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at a rate of 5.257% per annum compounded semi-annually.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (as defined below) shall be calculated as provided in the Base Indenture.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Note is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on such date and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable from the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be (each date on which interest is actually payable, an "Interest Payment Date").  The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Base Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Security, as defined in said Base Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment, which shall be the close of business on the March 1 and September 1 next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such regular record date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Security) is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Note may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Base Indenture.  The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Note shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made, at the option of the Corporation and upon prior notice to the Trustee, by check mailed to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account designated by a Holder in writing not less than 10 days prior to the date of payment.
                    The indebtedness evidenced by this Note is, to the extent provided in the Base Indenture, equal in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Corporation, and this Note is issued subject to the provisions of the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture with respect thereto.  Each Holder of this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, and authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to be bound by such provisions.  Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the provisions contained herein and in the Base Indenture the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture by each Holder of unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Corporation, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder or creditor upon said provisions.

By the terms of the Base Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture.
