Item 2.02        Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Item 7.01        Regulation FD Disclosure
                       On October 20, 2004, the Registrant issued a Press Release, attached hereto as an Exhibit 99.  The press release, which reports third quarter results, includes a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by SEC Regulation G, which is reconciled within the release.  Specifically, the release excludes a non-cash gain relating to the Conrail corporate reorganization from third quarter net income. This measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Management believes that net income excluding this item may be more indicative of operating results for comparison to prior periods and to other companies, and it intends to use this non-GAAP financial measure for comparison purposes at its analysts' meeting scheduled today and in future comparisons to the third quarter of 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 20, 2004 NORFOLK SOUTHERN REPORTS RECORD REVENUES, INCOME FROM RAILWAY OPERATIONS For the third quarter 2004: - Railway operating revenues increased 16 percent and set an all-time record of $1.9 billion. - Income from railway operations improved 51 percent to a record $469 million. - Net income was $288 million, $0.72 per diluted share. - Operating ratio improved 5.8 percentage points to 74.7 percent. NORFOLK, VA. - For the third-quarter of 2004, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) reported record revenues of $1.9 billion, up 16 percent compared with the same period last year, and record third-quarter income from railway operations of $469 million, up 51 percent compared with the third-quarter in 2003. Third-quarter reported net income was $288 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, which included a non-cash gain of $53 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, from the Conrail corporate reorganization. Excluding the gain, net income was $235 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 72 percent, compared with $137 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the same period last year. The railway operating ratio for the third quarter improved 5.8 percentage points to 74.7 percent compared with 80.5 percent in the same period of 2003. "By any measure, this was an extremely strong quarter for our company," said David R. Goode, chairman and chief executive officer. "We demonstrated uniform strength in the face of a robust peak traffic season, and our people and network performed well." For the first nine months, reported net income was $659 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, which included the $53 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, gain on the Conrail reorganization. Excluding the gain, net income was $606 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, an increase of 25 percent, compared with $483 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for the same period of last year. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 included a $114 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, gain due to a required industry-wide accounting change to account for the cost of removing railroad crossties, and a gain of $10 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, from discontinued motor carrier operations. Railway operating revenues for the first nine months of 2004 increased 12 percent to a record $5.4 billion compared with $4.8 billion for the same period a year earlier. The railway operating ratio for the first nine months improved 5.6 percentage points to 76.9 percent compared with 82.5 percent in the same period of 2003. Third-quarter general merchandise revenues reached $1.0 billion, an increase of 10 percent over the same quarter last year. For the first nine months, general merchandise revenues improved 8 percent to a record $3.0 billion compared with the year-earlier period. All merchandise markets reported revenue gains compared with the same periods a year earlier. Coal revenues increased 20 percent to $447 million in the third quarter and improved 14 percent to $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2004 compared with the same periods last year. This growth principally was driven by increases in export and utility coal revenues. Intermodal revenues grew 28 percent to a record $404 million in the third quarter and improved 21 percent to a record $1.1 billion for the first nine months compared to the same periods of 2003. Significantly increased traffic volumes and higher average revenues helped drive the growth. Third-quarter railway operating expenses were up $101 million, or 8 percent, compared with third quarter last year. For the first nine months, railway operating expenses rose $171 million, or 4 percent, over the same period in 2003. Both increases were primarily related to the higher business volumes. Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates 21,500 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers.

----------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. CONRAIL CORPORATE REORGANIZATION - On August 27, 2004, NS, CSX and Conrail completed a corporate reorganization of Conrail that resulted in the direct ownership and control by Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR) of routes and assets that had previously been operated by NSR under operating and lease agreements with a Conrail subsidiary. As a part of the reorganization, NSR issued new unsecured debt obligations, which were exchanged for unsecured debt obligations of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC), a Conrail subsidiary. In addition, NSR entered into new lease and sublease arrangements with CRC to support CRC's secured debt and lease obligations, and the long-term note due to Conrail was eliminated. The reorganization did not affect the Shared Asset Areas, which continue to be owned and operated by CRC, and are reflected in NS' remaining Investment in Conrail as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This distribution was accounted for at fair value, resulting in a net gain of $53 million, which is included in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The gain increased net income by $53 million, or 13 cents per diluted share. 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2003 - First-quarter 2003 results included an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share (basic and diluted), related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN 2003 - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. The cumulative effect of these changes amounted to $114 million, or 29 cents per share (basic and diluted). 4. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail in accordance with the operating and lease agreements in place before the Conrail corporate reorganization (see note 1) reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments was borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The net borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $118 million in the first nine months of 2004 and $174 million in the first nine months of 2003.
