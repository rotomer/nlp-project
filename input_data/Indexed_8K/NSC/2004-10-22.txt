NORFOLK SOUTHERN RESPONDS TO STB VOTE ON RATE CASES
 
NORFOLK, VA -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) said it is pleased that the Surface Transportation Board (STB) voted today to uphold the Company's rates on certain coal movements in the two pending rate cases brought by Duke Energy Corp. and Carolina Power & Light Company. In the ruling, the STB invited Duke Energy and Carolina Power & Light to initiate proceedings to determine whether the phase-in constraints of the Constrained Market Pricing Guidelines should apply. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the impact of the decisions at this time. Norfolk Southern will continue to monitor developments in the two cases. 
The Surface Transportation Board's discussion of the two cases was webcast from the Board's Web site on Oct. 20, 2004. Archived recordings of past meetings are available at  www.stb.dot.gov.
