ITEM: Results of Operations and Financial Condition
ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Specifically, the release excludes costs related to a voluntary separation program and an asset impairment charge from fourth quarter 2003 net income for the purposes of comparing it to fourth quarter 2004 net income.  The release also excludes the third-quarter noncash gain from the Conrail corporate reorganization from 2004 net income for the purposes of comparing it to 2003 net income.  For comparison to corresponding 2004 periods, the release excludes costs related to the voluntary separation program from 2003 fourth quarter and year-end income from railway operations and railway operating expenses, which is used to calculate the operating ratios for the same periods.  These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the measures reported in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Management is of the opinion that net income, income from railway operations and railway operating expenses, excluding the items discussed above, may be more indicative of operating results for comparison to future periods and to other companies and it intends to use these non-GAAP financial measures for comparison purposes at its analysts' meeting scheduled today and in future comparisons to the relevant periods.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 26, 2005 NORFOLK SOUTHERN REPORTS RECORD INCOME FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND 2004 For fourth quarter 2004: * Railway operating revenues increased 16 percent to a record $1.9 billion. * Income from railway operations was a fourth-quarter record $462 million. * Net income was a fourth-quarter record $264 million or $0.65 per diluted share. For 2004: * Railway operating revenues increased 13 percent to a record $7.3 billion. * Income from railway operations was a record $1.7 billion. * Net income was a record $923 million or $2.31 per diluted share. NORFOLK, VA - Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported record fourth-quarter net income of $264 million or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $52 million or $0.13 per diluted share for fourth-quarter 2003. Fourth-quarter 2003 was affected by costs related to a voluntary separation program and an asset impairment charge that together reduced the quarter's net income by $119 million or $0.30 per share. Excluding the effects of those items, fourth-quarter 2003 net income would have been $171 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Net income for 2004 was a record $923 million or $2.31 per diluted share, including a third-quarter noncash gain of $53 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the Conrail corporate reorganization. Excluding the noncash gain, 2004 net income would have been $870 million or $2.18 per diluted share, compared with net income of $535 million or $1.37 per diluted share for 2003. "In practically every way, 2004 was a record year for Norfolk Southern," said David R. Goode, chairman and chief executive officer. "We topped $7 billion in revenue for the first time in our history, and all of our major business sectors set revenue records. The full-year operating ratio of 76.7 percent was substantially better than the prior year. Norfolk Southern people responded admirably to the challenge of high demands for service. Our investments in people, systems and infrastructure to prepare for business opportunities paid off in 2004," Goode said. Railway operating revenues and income from railway operations each set fourth-quarter and full-year records. Railway operating revenues were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 16 percent over fourth-quarter 2003, and $7.3 billion for 2004, an increase of 13 percent compared with 2003 results. Coal, general merchandise and intermodal traffic all set revenue records for the quarter and year. Intermodal set volume records as well for the quarter and year and reported the biggest revenue increases compared with 2003, 32 percent to $441 million for the fourth quarter, and 24 percent to $1.5 billion for 2004. General merchandise revenues totaled $1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 10 percent over fourth quarter 2003, and $4 billion for 2004, a 9 percent increase compared with 2003. All merchandise commodities except automotive posted record revenue for the year, and agriculture and metals and construction set carload records for 2004. Total general merchandise carloads set a fourth-quarter record. Coal revenue increased 19 percent in the fourth quarter over fourth-quarter 2003 to $459 million. For 2004, coal revenue increased 15 percent compared with 2003 to $1.7 billion. Income from railway operations was $462 million for the quarter and $1.7 billion for 2004, up 40 percent for the quarter and 45 percent for the year compared with results for 2003, excluding the separation charge. Income from railway operations for 2003 was $224 million for the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. Excluding the $107 million charge for the separation program, income from railway operations for 2003 would have been $331 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the year. The fourth-quarter and full-year operating ratios were the best since 1998. The fourth-quarter ratio of 76.3 percent was an improvement of 4 percentage points compared with the fourth-quarter 2003 operating ratio, excluding the separation charge. For 2004, the operating ratio was 76.7, 5.2 percentage points better than 2003, excluding the voluntary separation charge. The operating ratios in 2003 were 86.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 83.5 percent for the year. Excluding the $107 million separation charge, which added 6.3 percentage points to the fourth-quarter ratio and 1.6 percentage points to the year, the 2003 operating ratios would have been 80.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 81.9 percent for the year.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: 1. CONRAIL CORPORATE REORGANIZATION - On August 27, 2004, NS, CSX and Conrail completed a corporate reorganization of Conrail that resulted in the direct ownership and control by Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR) of routes and assets that had previously been operated by NSR under operating and lease agreements with a Conrail subsidiary. As a part of the reorganization, NSR issued new unsecured debt obligations, which were exchanged for unsecured debt obligations of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC), a Conrail subsidiary. In addition, NSR entered into new lease and sublease arrangements with CRC to support CRC's secured debt and lease obligations, and the long-term note due to Conrail was eliminated. The reorganization did not affect the Shared Assets Areas, which continue to be owned and operated by CRC, and are reflected in NS' remaining Investment in Conrail as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This distribution was accounted for at fair value, resulting in a net gain of $53 million, which is included in Other income - net in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year. The gain increased net income by $53 million, or 13 cents per share (basic and diluted). 2. VOLUNTARY SEPARATION PROGRAM IN 2003 - Fourth-quarter 2003 results included $107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program, which reduced net income by $66 million, or 17 cents per share (basic and diluted). 3. ASSET IMPAIRMENT IN 2003 - Fourth-quarter 2003 results included an $84 million non-cash reduction in the carrying value of certain telecommunications assets to recognize their impaired value. This charge reduced net income by $53 million, or 13 cents per share (basic and diluted). 4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN 2003 - First-quarter 2003 results included an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per share (basic and diluted), related to the 1998 sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary, North American Van Lines, Inc. This non-cash gain resulted from the resolution of tax issues related to the transaction. 5. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN 2003 - NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of depreciation. NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" (FIN No. 46), effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to 2003. Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS. The cumulative effect of the changes amounted to $114 million, or 29 cents per share (basic and diluted). 6. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail in accordance with the operating and lease agreements in place before the Conrail corporate reorganization (see note 1) reduce NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments was borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The net borrowings are included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $118 million in 2004 and $203 million in 2003.
