Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated 4 World Financial Center New York, New York 10080 Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time Norfolk Southern Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Corporation"), proposes to enter into a Pricing Agreement (the "Pricing Agreement") substantially in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities"). The Designated Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters are herein sometimes referred to as "Underwriters' Securities". The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the senior indenture dated as of January 15, 1991 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture") between Norfolk Southern Corporation and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, formerly known as First Trust of New York National Association, as successor trustee. 1. Operation of Agreement. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Corporation to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Corporation to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and applicable prospectus) the terms of such Designated Securities. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. Representations and Warranties of Corporation.

In addition, such counsel shall state that, although he is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have led him to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date and the Time of Delivery, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Corporation prior to the Time of Delivery, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that such counsel expresses no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules, other financial data and the Forms T-1 filed as an exhibit to the latest registration statement; In rendering the opinion required under this Section 6(c), counsel to the Corporation need not express any opinion concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America, provided that such counsel states that he is aware of no difference between the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the laws of the State of New York which would cause him to believe that his opinion would be inapplicable if it were furnished in connection with the laws of the State of New York. In addition, in rendering the opinion required under this Section 6(c), such counsel may rely as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems it proper, on certificates of responsible officials of the Corporation and public officials. (d) On the date of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the independent accountants of the Corporation who have certified the financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, there shall not have been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Underwriters' Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; (f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Corporation's debt securities or preferred stock, if any, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the 1933 Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced on or after such date that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Corporation's debt securities or preferred stock, if any; (g) The Corporation shall have complied with the provisions of Section 4(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus; (h) The Corporation shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Corporation satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Corporation herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Corporation of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 7. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification of Underwriters. The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Corporation; and (iii) against any and all expenses whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the "Lead Underwriter"), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation by any Underwriter through the Lead Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (b) Indemnification of Corporation, Directors and Officers. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 7(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Corporation by such Underwriter through the Lead Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the event of any such claim, action or proceeding, if the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, however, (i) if the indemnifying party fails to assume such defense in a timely manner or (ii) if there exists or may exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then such indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party. In respect of any claim, action or proceeding the defense of which shall have been assumed by the indemnifying party, in accordance with the foregoing, each indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to retain its own counsel at its own expense. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Designated Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Pricing Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Corporation and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Designated Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Corporation or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Corporation and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7(d), each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Corporation, each officer of the Corporation who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to the principal amount of Designated Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement and not joint. 8. Termination of Agreement. (a) Termination; General. The Representatives may terminate a Pricing Agreement, by notice to the Corporation, at any time at or prior to the Time of Delivery (i) if there has been, on or after the date of such Pricing Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Corporation and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Designated Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Designated Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Corporation has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities. (b) Liabilities. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to this Section 8 (other than as pursuant to clause (a)(i) thereof), the Corporation shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 5 and 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason Underwriters' Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Corporation as provided herein, the Corporation will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities. 9. Default by One or More Underwriters. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Underwriters' Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, then the Corporation shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Corporation that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, or the Corporation notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, the Representatives or the Corporation shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Underwriters' Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Corporation agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Corporation as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Underwriters' Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Corporation shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Underwriters' Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Corporation as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Corporation shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Corporation, except for the expenses to be borne by the Corporation and the Underwriters as provided in Section 5 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Corporation and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Corporation, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Corporation, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. Parties Entitled to Rely; Notices. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Corporation shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Corporation set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Vice President and Treasurer; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' questionnaire, or telex constituting such questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Corporation by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 12. Parties. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Corporation and, to the extent provided in Sections 7 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Corporation and each person who controls the Corporation or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 13. Time of the Essence. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
15. Counterparts. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

(b) If the Notes are only partially redeemed pursuant to this Section 401, such Notes will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Security Registrar; provided, that if at the time of redemption, the Notes are registered as a Global Note, the Depositary shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Notes beneficially held by each Holder of Notes to be redeemed.

By the terms of the Base Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture. This Security is the series designated on the face hereof (the "Notes") and is limited in aggregate principal amount as specified in said Ninth Supplemental Indenture.

The Base Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Security of any series affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Security of such series, to waive any past Default under the Base Indenture, and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Base Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Exhibit 5.1 [Norfolk Southern Corporation Letterhead] March 15, 2005 Norfolk Southern Corporation Three Commercial Place Norfolk, VA 23510-2191 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior General Counsel of Norfolk Southern Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Corporation"), and, as such, I have acted as counsel to the Corporation in connection with the issuance and sale of the Corporation's 6% Senior Notes due 2105, in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (collectively, the "Securities" or the "Designated Securities") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement of the Corporation, dated March 7, 2005 (the "Base Underwriting Agreement"), and the Pricing Agreement, dated March 7, 2005 (the "Pricing Agreement" and, together with the Base Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative to the underwriter identified on Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement (the "Underwriter"), which Pricing Agreement incorporates in its entirety all the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement. The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated March 11, 2005 (the "Ninth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Corporation and First Trust of New York, National Association (the name of which has been changed to U.S. Trust Bank National Association), as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), which supplemented the Indenture, dated as of January 15, 1991 (the "Base Indenture" and together with the Ninth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and the Trustee, as previously supplemented. This opinion is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have, or an attorney working for me has, examined and relied upon originals or copies of the following: (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-119398), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act, of up to $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of (A) debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares and/or common stock of the Corporation, and/or (B) in conjunction with the Corporation's trust subsidiary, Norfolk Southern Capital Trust I, trust preferred securities and related guarantees of the Corporation, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on September 30, 2004, under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"); (ii) the Prospectus Supplement, dated March 7, 2005 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), together with the Base Prospectus, dated October 28, 2004 (together, the "Prospectus"); (iii) the Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, on Form T-1 of the Trustee; (iv) the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus through March 7, 2005; (v) an executed copy of the Indenture; (vi) the Securities and specimen certificates thereof; (vii) the Underwriting Agreement; (viii) an executed copy of the Pricing Agreement; (ix) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as currently in effect; (x) the Bylaws of the Corporation, as currently in effect; and (xi) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Corporation relating to the issuance and sale of the Securities and related matters. I have, or an attorney working for me has, also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such records of the Corporation and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Corporation and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein. In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted as certified, photostatic or facsimile copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making my examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by parties other than the Corporation, I have assumed that such parties had, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such other parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which I did not independently establish or verify, I have relied upon statements and representations of the respective officers and other representatives of the Corporation and certificates of public officials. I am a member of the Bar in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I do not purport to express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction other than the laws of the United States of America to the extent referred to specifically herein. However, I am aware of no difference between the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the laws of the State of New York which cause me to believe that the opinions expressed herein would be inapplicable if they were furnished in connection with the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as the opinions set forth below relate to the Indenture and the Securities as valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Corporation, I have relied solely upon an opinion letter of even date herewith from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, New York, New York, with respect to all matters of New York law related thereto. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Corporation, and it is a valid and binding agreement of the Corporation, enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with its terms, except (a) to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (b) I express no opinion as to Section 512 of the Base Indenture. 2. The Securities have been duly authorized, and when executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Corporation entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with their terms, except (a) to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (b) I express no opinion as to Section 512 of the Base Indenture. I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the General Rules and Regulations thereunder. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and I disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law. Very truly yours, /s/ Joseph C. Dimino, Esq.
