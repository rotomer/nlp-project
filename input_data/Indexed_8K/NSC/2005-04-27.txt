NORFOLK
SOUTHERN REPORTS RECORD REVENUES;
NET INCOME INCREASES 23 PERCENT
 
For first quarter 2005 vs. first quarter 2004:
Railway operating revenues improved 16 percent to a record $1.96 billion.
Income from railway operations rose 16 percent to $403 million and set a first-quarter record.
Net income climbed 23 percent to $194 million, or $0.47 per share.
NORFOLK, VA. - For the first quarter of 2005, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) reported net income of $194 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, up 23 percent compared with $158 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for first-quarter 2004.
First-quarter results included approximately $35 million for expenses (pretax) related to the Jan. 6 train derailment in Graniteville, S.C.
"Our solid first-quarter results reflect robust volumes and revenues and along with our improving operating ratio demonstrate the focus of Norfolk Southern people on safety and service," said David R. Goode, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to show strong momentum on volume and revenue growth."
First-quarter railway operating revenues of $1.96 billion were the highest of any quarter in Norfolk Southern's history and improved 16 percent compared with $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2004, while traffic volume was up approximately 106,000 units, or 6 percent.
General merchandise revenues for the first quarter reached a record $1.1 billion, an increase of 12 percent over the same period last year. All marketing groups, except automotive, reported strong revenue gains during the period. Metals and construction revenues led the growth with a 22 percent increase, followed by paper, up 19 percent, and chemicals, up 14 percent.
Intermodal revenues set a first-quarter record of $408 million, up 24 percent, compared with first-quarter 2004. This was the fifth consecutive quarter during which intermodal showed double-digit revenue growth.
Coal revenues increased 17 percent to $467 million in the first quarter compared with the same quarter last year. The export and utility coal markets benefited from increased traffic volumes. Export traffic climbed 19 percent in the first quarter compared with the same period of 2004.
First-quarter railway operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up 16 percent over the same period in 2004. This primarily was due to costs associated with increased traffic volume, higher diesel fuel prices and expenses related to the Graniteville derailment.
 
For the quarter, the railroad operating ratio improved to 79.4 (even including expenses for Graniteville, which added 1.7 points) compared with 79.6 a year earlier.
Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway subsidiary operates approximately 21,300 route miles in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada, serving every major container port in the eastern United States and providing superior connections to western rail carriers.

GRANITEVILLE DERAILMENT - In the first quarter of 2005, NS recorded a liability related to the Jan. 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC. The liability, which includes a current and long-term portion, represents NS' best estimate based on current facts and circumstances. The estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic losses, personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as third-party response costs. NS' commercial insurance policies cover expenses related to this derailment above NS' self-insured retention, including its own response costs and legal fees. Accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a current and long-term receivable for estimated recoveries from its insurance carriers. First-quarter results include approximately $35 million of expenses related to this incident, which represents NS' retention under its insurance policies and other uninsured costs, and which reduced net income by approximately $21 million, or 5 cents per share (basic and diluted). NS expects $6 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. While it is reasonable to expect that the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded, such a change would be offset by a corresponding change in the recovery receivable. As a result, NS does not believe that it is reasonably likely that its total loss (the difference between the liability and future recoveries) will be materially different than the loss recorded in the first quarter of 2005. NS expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential claims and settlements above its self-insurance retention. 2. CONRAIL CORPORATE REORGANIZATION - On August 27, 2004, NS, CSX and Conrail completed a corporate reorganization of Conrail that resulted in the direct ownership and control by Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR) of routes and assets that had previously been operated by NSR under operating and lease agreements with a Conrail subsidiary. As a part of the reorganization, NSR issued new unsecured debt obligations, which were exchanged for unsecured debt obligations of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC), a Conrail subsidiary. In addition, NSR entered into new lease and sublease arrangements with CRC to support CRC's secured debt and lease obligations, and the long-term note due to Conrail was eliminated. The reorganization did not affect the Shared Assets Areas, which continue to be owned and operated by CRC. After the reorganization, "Conrail rents and services" reflects only the expenses associated with the Shared Assets Areas, and other expenses (primarily the depreciation related to the routes and assets) are reflected in their respective line items. 3. PAYMENTS TO CONRAIL - Payments made to Conrail in accordance with the operating and lease agreements in place before the Conrail corporate reorganization (see note 2 on page 4) reduced NS' "Net cash provided by operating activities." A significant portion of these payments was borrowed back from a Conrail subsidiary. The net borrowings were included in NS' "Net cash used for financing activities" and totaled $69 million in the first quarter of 2004.
