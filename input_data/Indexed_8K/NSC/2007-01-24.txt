Regulation FD Disclosure
 On January 24, 2007, the Registrant issued a Press Release, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.  The press release, which reports fourth quarter and 2006 results, includes a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by SEC Regulation G, in the last sentence of the second paragraph, which is reconciled verbally within the release.  Specifically, the release excludes the effects of Ohio tax legislation from net income and diluted earnings per share for 2005 for the purposes of comparing it to net income and diluted earnings per share for 2006.  This measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income and diluted earnings per share reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Management believes that net income and diluted earnings per share excluding this item may be more indicative of operating results for comparison to prior periods and to other companies and it intends to use this non-GAAP financial measure for comparison purposes at its analysts' meeting scheduled today and in future comparisons to the second quarter of 2005.

 -

NORFOLK, VA - Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) today reported record fourth-quarter 2006 net income of $385 million, an increase of 6 percent compared with $362 million for fourth-quarter 2005.  Earnings per diluted share were a record $0.95, up 9 percent compared with the $0.87 per diluted share earned in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Net income for 2006 was a record $1.5 billion, or $3.57 per diluted share, an increase of 16 percent compared with net income of $1.3 billion, or $3.11 per diluted share, for 2005.  Results for 2005 included a benefit of $96 million from the effects of Ohio tax legislation, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.23.  Excluding this item, net income for 2006 would have been 25 percent higher than the $1.2 billion, or $2.88 per diluted share, earned in 2005.
 
"Our financial performance continues to showcase the strength and dedication of our people and this company.  We are handling business demands unimaginable only a few years ago, and doing it safely and efficiently, often in the face of considerable challenges.  And we continue to set historically good results that benefit our customers and investors," said Chief Executive Officer Wick Moorman.
 
 "We're clearly facing a softer economy, at least in terms of some of our important markets and the overall surface transportation marketplace, but our traffic volumes are still at levels close to our all-time highs, evidence that the railroad renaissance is still alive and well."
 
Railway operating revenues set a fourth-quarter record, reaching $2.3 billion, a 3 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.  For 2006, railway operating revenues of $9.4 billion were the highest of any year in Norfolk Southern's history, improving 10 percent compared with 2005 results.
 
         General merchandise revenues rose 2 percent to $1.2 billion, setting a fourth-quarter record, and climbed 11 percent to a record $5.1 billion for the year compared with the same periods of 2005.  For both periods, all commodity groups, except automotive, reported revenue growth.  The quarterly increase reflected higher average revenues, which offset lower volume.  For the year, the increase resulted from higher average revenues, including increased fuel surcharges.
 
         Coal revenues set records for both the fourth quarter and the year, rising 13 percent to $592 million for the quarter and growing 10 percent to $2.3 billion for the year, compared with the same periods of 2005.  The revenue increases during both periods primarily were driven by higher average revenues, including fuel surcharges, and increased traffic volume due to demand for utility coal.
 
Intermodal revenues for the fourth quarter were $493 million, a 5 percent decrease compared to the same quarter of 2005, reflecting a 3 percent decline in traffic volume.  For the year, intermodal revenues reached a record $2.0 billion, up 8 percent compared to 2005, principally the result of higher fuel surcharges and increased traffic volume.
 
Railway operating expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 3 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2005, and $6.9 billion for 2006, an increase of 7 percent over 2005.  The increases were primarily the result of higher compensation and benefits, increased maintenance activities and, for the year, higher diesel fuel prices and volume-related expenses.
 
Income from railway operations set records for the fourth quarter and the year, increasing 3 percent to $614 million for the quarter and climbing 21 percent to $2.6 billion for the year, compared with the same periods of 2005.
 
The fourth-quarter operating ratio improved to 73.5 percent, compared with 73.7 percent for the same period of 2005.  For the year, the operating ratio improved 2.4 percentage points to 72.8 percent.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.   REQUIRED ACCOUNTING CHANGE - SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS -
Effective January 1, 2006, NS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment" [SFAS 123(R)].  This statement applies to awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after the effective date as well as awards that are unvested at the effective date and includes, among other things, the requirement to expense the fair value of stock options.  As a result of the implementation of SFAS 123(R), compensation and benefits expense for the year included $23 million for the accelerated recognition of awards granted to retirement eligible employees and $13 million for stock options granted to non-retirement eligible employees.
2.   SETTLEMENTS OF COAL RATE CASES -
In the second quarter of 2005, NS entered into settlement agreements with two utility customers that resolved their rail transportation rate cases before the Surface Transportation Board (STB).  As a result of the settlements, NS recognized additional revenue related to the period in dispute, which net of associated expenses and income taxes increased second-quarter net income by $24 million, or 6 cents per diluted share.
3.   REDUCTION OF DEFERRED TAXES -
In the second quarter of 2005, Ohio enacted tax legislation that phases out its Corporate Franchise Tax, which was generally based on federal taxable income, and phases in a new gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax, which is based on current year sales and rentals.  The elimination of the Corporate Franchise Tax resulted in a reduction of NS' deferred income tax liability in the second quarter, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which increased net income by $96 million, or 23 cents per diluted share.
4.   REQUIRED ACCOUNTING CHANGE - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS -
As of Dec. 31, 2006, NS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" (SFAS 158).  This statement requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.  As a result of adopting this standard, NS reduced its pension asset by $217 million and increased its pension and postretirement liabilities by $294 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding reduction to stockholders' equity of $314 million (net of tax) reflected as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The adoption of SFAS 158 had no impact on years prior to 2006 and had no effect on the calculation of expenses for pensions and postretirement benefits.
5.   GRANITEVILLE DERAILMENT -
   In the first quarter of 2005, NS recorded a liability related to the Jan. 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC.  The liability, which includes a current and long-term portion, represents NS' best estimate based on current facts and circumstances.  The estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic losses, personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as third-party response costs.  NS' commercial insurance policies are expected to cover expenses related to this derailment above NS' self-insured retention, including its own response costs and legal fees.  Accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a current and long-term receivable for estimated recoveries from its insurance carriers.
Results for 2005 include approximately $41 million of expenses related to this incident, which represents NS' retention under its insurance policies and other uninsured costs, and which reduced net income by approximately $24 million, or 6 cents per diluted share.
While it is reasonable to expect that the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded, such a change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance receivable.  As a result, NS does not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss (the difference between the liability and future recoveries) will be materially different than the loss recorded in 2005.  NS expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential claims and settlements above its self-insurance retention.
6.   STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM -
In November 2005, NS' Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of NS common stock through the end of 2015.  In 2006, NS purchased and retired 21.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $964 million under this program.
7.   DEBT EXCHANGE -
In the second quarter of 2005, NS issued $717 million of new unsecured notes ($350 million at 5.64% due 2029 and $367 million at 5.59% due 2025) and paid $218 million of premium in exchange for $717 million of its previously issued unsecured notes ($350 million at 7.8% due 2027, $200 million at 7.25% due 2031, and $167 million at 9.0% due 2021).  The $218 million cash premium payment is reflected as a reduction of debt in the Statement of Cash Flows and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt.
