FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BALANCED TRAFFIC MIX DRIVES SUCCESS, MOORMAN TELLS STOCKHOLDERS AT ANNUAL MEETING
NORFOLK, VA - A balanced mix of traffic has enabled Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:
NSC) to post solid financial and operating performance  in spite of softness in the housing and
automotive markets, said Chief Executive Officer Wick Moorman during the company's 26
th
annual stockholders meeting, held today in Norfolk, Va.
 
         "Our results speak volumes for something that we talk about all the time - the strength of
our balanced portfolio of business," Moorman said. "We're really seeing two different economies
out there in that a large component of our business is very healthy. Our agricultural business and
anything having to do with commodities are very strong, along with coal, steel, metals, and some
other business. At the same time, we are seeing the ongoing effects of slowdowns in housing-
related and automotive-related transportation business."
 
           Moorman said that factors supporting long-term growth in rail freight demand, including
higher fuel prices, increased highway congestion, and truck driver shortages, "all remain in place,
and we're confident that volume growth will resume as the economy rebounds. We continue
planning for a future that we have every reason to believe is bright for our company and our
industry."
 
            In official business, stockholders re-elected four directors: Gerald L. Baliles, director of the
Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia; Gene R. Carter, executive director and
chief executive officer of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development; Karen N.
Horn, a partner with Brock Capital Group, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland, and former chair and chief executive officer of Bank One, Cleveland, N.A.; and retired
Navy Adm. J. Paul Reason, a member of the Naval Studies Board of the National Academy of
Sciences, and former commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Stockholders also ratified the
appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors.
 
            Norfolk Southern Corporation is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its
