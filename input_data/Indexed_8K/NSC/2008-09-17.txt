Item 7.01.
Regulation FD Disclosure.
 In a joint press release issued yesterday, Norfolk Southern Railway Company and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) outlined terms of their recent agreement.  The cost of the lump-sum payments will be included in the Registrant's third-quarter 2008 results.  In addition, the Registrant expects certain other adjustments to largely offset this impact.
Any statements contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K which are not related to historical facts are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ.  See the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, as supplemented by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for discussions of certain of these risks and uncertainties.
