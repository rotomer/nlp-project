Item 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 2.03     Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant
On January 12, 2009, the Registrant entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with CitiGroup Global Markets Inc., J. P. Morgan Securities Inc., and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"), under which the Registrant agreed to sell $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Registrant's 5.750% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes").  The Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties and indemnification and contribution provisions whereby the Registrant, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities.
The Registrant estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $494 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and estimated offering expenses. The Registrant intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.
The Notes will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 5.75% per annum and will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Registrant's option, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price payable in cash equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a specified rate, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. 
The Notes will be issued pursuant to, and governed by, an indenture to be entered into between the Registrant and U.S. Bank Trust National Association ("U.S. Bank"),  as trustee.  The Registrant also will enter into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which the Registrant will agree to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 180 days after the closing date of the offering, and use commercially reasonable efforts to have declared effective within 270 days from the closing date, an exchange offer registration statement pursuant to which the Registrant will issue in exchange for tendered Notes registered securities containing terms identical to the Notes in all material respects.
U.S. Bank and its affiliates, as well as certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, commercial banking and investment banking services for the Registrant, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses and none of which are material individually or in the aggregate with respect to any individual party. 
The Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, and the description of the Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.

Covenants of the Company
                        (i)        .  The Company agrees that it will not and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit any offer to buy, sell or make any offer or sale of, or otherwise negotiate in respect of, securities of the Company of any class if, as a result of the doctrine of "integration" referred to in Rule 502 under the 1933 Act, such offer or sale would render invalid (for the purpose of (i) the sale of the offered Securities by the Company to the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the resale of the offered Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers or (iii) the resale of the offered Securities by such Subsequent Purchasers to others) the exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof or by Rule 144A or by Regulation S thereunder or otherwise.
Integration
                        (ii)        .  The Company agrees that, in order to render the offered Securities eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, while any of the offered Securities remain outstanding, it will make available, upon request, to any holder of offered Securities or prospective purchasers of Securities the information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4), unless the Company furnishes information to the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.
Rule 144A Information
                        (iii)        .

Qualified Institutional Buyer
                (d)        .  Each Initial Purchaser understands that the offered Securities have not been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act.  Each Initial Purchaser severally represents and agrees, that, except as permitted by Section 6(a) above, it has offered and sold Securities and will offer and sell Securities (i) as part of their distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until forty days after the later of the date upon which the offering of the Securities commences and Closing Time, only in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S, Rule 144A or another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act.

Resale Pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S or Rule 144A

                SECTION 7.        . 
Indemnification
                (a)        .  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its Affiliates, its selling agents and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows:
Indemnification of Initial Purchasers
                        (i)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package, or any Supplemental Offering Materials, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
                        (ii)        against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 7(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
                        (iii)        against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
                        provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any such untrue statement or omission or any such alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Initial Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use in any Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package or in any Supplemental Offering Materials.
                (b).  Each Initial Purchaser severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in any Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package or any Supplemental Offering Materials in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives  expressly for use therein.
        Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers
                (c)        .  Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  In the event of any such claim, action or proceeding, if the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel; provided, however, (i) if the indemnifying party fails to assume such defense in a timely manner or (ii) if there exists or may exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party for the same counsel to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then such indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party.  In respect of any claim, action or proceeding the defense of which shall have been assumed by the indemnifying party, in accordance with the foregoing, each indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to retain its own counsel at its own expense.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification
                (d).  If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
        Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
                SECTION 8.        .  If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
                        The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Initial Purchasers, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities.
                        The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
                        The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
                        Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased and sold by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
                        No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
                        For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Initial Purchaser's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
                SECTION 9.        .  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Initial Purchaser, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
                SECTION 10.       
Termination of Agreement.
                (a)        .  The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the date as of which information is given in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Disclosure Package or the Final Offering Memorandum (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement), any Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ System has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York or Virginia authorities.
Termination; General
                (b)        .  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 7, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities
                SECTION 11.        .  If one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail at Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or any other initial purchasers, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Initial Purchasers
                        (i)        if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or
                        (ii)        if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser.
                        No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of its default.
                        In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements.

                        (xii)        The documents incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum as amended or supplemented, when they were filed with the Commission appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the financial statements, related schedules and other financial data, and such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum as amended or supplemented.
                        In addition, such counsel shall state that, although he is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering Memorandum, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have led him to believe that the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto at the time the Offering Memorandum was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented Offering Memorandum was issued or at the Closing Time, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or that the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that such counsel expresses no opinion or belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules, other financial data.
                        In rendering the opinion required under this Annex I, counsel to the Company need not express any opinion concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America, provided that such counsel states that he is aware of no difference between the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the laws of the State of New York which would cause him to believe that his opinion would be inapplicable if it were furnished in connection with the laws of the State of New York.  In addition, in rendering the opinion required under this Annex I, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems it proper, on certificates of responsible officials of the Company and public officials.
