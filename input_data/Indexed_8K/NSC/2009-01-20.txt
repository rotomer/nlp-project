Item 2.03     Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant
On January 15, 2009, the Registrant entered into an Indenture (the "Indenture") with U.S. Bank Trust National Association ("U.S. Bank"), as trustee, pursuant to which the Registrant issued $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Registrant's 5.750% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes").  The Notes were sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated January 12, 2008 (the "Purchase Agreement"), filed by the Registrant on a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 13, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Indenture provides that the Notes will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 5.75% per annum and that the Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Registrant's option, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price payable in cash equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a specified rate, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.  The Indenture contains customary events of default with respect to the Notes, including failure to make required payments, failure to comply with certain agreements or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency.  The Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and the description of the Indenture contained herein is qualified by reference thereto. 
On January 15, 2009, in connection with the sale of the Notes, the Registrant entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes under the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers").  Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 180 days after the closing date of the offering, and use commercially reasonable efforts to have declared effective within 270 days from the closing date, an exchange offer registration statement pursuant to which the Registrant will issue in exchange for tendered Notes registered securities containing terms identical to the Notes in all material respects.  The Registration Rights Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
U.S. Bank and its affiliates, as well as certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, commercial banking and investment banking services for the Registrant, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses and none of which are material individually or in the aggregate with respect to any individual party.

                        INDENTURE dated as of January 15, 2009, between NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, a national banking association duly organized and existing under the laws of the United States, as trustee (the "Trustee").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         SECTION 2.04.  .  (a)  The Company shall maintain an office or agency in the City of New York where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency in the City of New York where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent").  The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange.  The Company may have one or more coregistrars and one or more additional paying agents.  The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.                                                                                                 SECTION 2.05.  .  Prior to each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due.  The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment.  If the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.  The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent.  Upon complying with this Section 2.05, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.                                                                                                 SECTION 2.07.  .  (a)  If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that such Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee.  Such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any coregistrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced.  The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.                                                                                                 SECTION 2.08.  .  (a)  Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding.  A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.                                                                                                 SECTION 2.09.  .  Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities.  Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.  Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.                                                                                                 SECTION 2.11.  .  If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner.  The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date.  The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.                                                                                                   SECTION 3.02.  .  If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances.  The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption.  The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $2,000.  Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in amounts of $2,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000.  Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.  The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities to be redeemed.                                   (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;                                                                                                   SECTION 3.04.  .  Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice.  Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of redemption).  Failure to give notice of any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.                                                                                                 SECTION 3.06.  .  Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.                                                                                                   SECTION 4.03.  .  (a)  If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.                                                                                                     SECTION 4.04.  .  Subject to Article V, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and that of each Subsidiary and the rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise or to retain any Subsidiary if the Company shall determine that the preservation or retention thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as a whole and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.                                                                                                 SECTION 4.07.  .  For so long as any Securities issued pursuant to this Indenture are Outstanding, the Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, charge or security interest of any kind, other than a Purchase Money Lien, upon any stock or indebtedness, whether owned on the date any Securities are first issued or thereafter acquired, of any Principal Subsidiary, to secure any Obligation (other than the Securities) of the Company, any Subsidiary or any other person, without in any such case making effective provision whereby all of the outstanding Securities shall be directly secured equally and ratably with such Obligation.  This Section shall not (i) apply to any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, charge or security interest on any stock or indebtedness of a corporation existing at the time such corporation becomes a Subsidiary, (ii) restrict any other property of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (iii) restrict the sale by the Company or any Subsidiary of any stock or indebtedness of any Subsidiary.                                                                                                 SECTION 4.09.  .  The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 4.01 and 4.08 of this Indenture with respect to the Securities if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.                                          (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities being purchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Securities pursuant to the Repurchase Offer have been complied with.                                                 (2)        default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at its Maturity; or                                                                                                                 SECTION 6.03.  .  (a)  If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.                                                                                                 SECTION 6.04.  .  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on a Security or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder of the Securities.  When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.                                                                                                     SECTION 6.07.  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.                                                                                                 SECTION 6.09.  .  The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.                                                                                                 SECTION 6.11.  .  In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.  This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities.                                                                                                         SECTION 7.02.  .  The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person.  The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.  The Trustee may, however, in its discretion make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney.                                                                                                 SECTION 7.03.  .  The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.  Any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar may do the same with like rights.  However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11                                                                                                 SECTION 7.05.  .  If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 30 days after it is known to a Responsible Officer or written notice of it is received by the Trustee.  Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders.                                                                                                 SECTION 7.07.  .  (a)  The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee.  The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.  The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services.  Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts.  The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss, liability, damages, claim or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance and administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder.  The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder unless the Company has been prejudiced thereby.  The Company shall defend the claim, and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.  The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.  The Company need not pay for any settlement made by the Trustee without the Company's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  All indemnifications and releases from liability granted hereunder to the Trustee shall extend to its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.                                                                                                   SECTION 7.09.  .  (a)  If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation or banking association without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

                        (c)        The Company will cause each Paying Agent for the Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

                        (e)        Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.

                        (b)        At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if

                (iii)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Appendix A (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Security may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Depository or a nominee of such successor Depository.
                (iv)  In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities pursuant to Section 2.4 prior to the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Securities, such Securities may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse of the Initial Securities intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company.

                        (B)  in the case of any Transfer Restricted Security that is represented by a Global Security, the Registrar shall permit the Holder thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a Security that does not bear the legends set forth above and rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted Security,
in either case, if the Holder certifies in writing to the Registrar that its request for such exchange was made in reliance on Rule 144 (such certification to be in the form set forth on the reverse of the Initial Security).
                        (iii)  After a transfer of any Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, during the period of the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities, all requirements pertaining to restricted securities legends on such Initial Security or such Private Exchange Security will cease to apply, and an Initial Security or Private Exchange Security, as the case may be, in global form without restricted security legends will be available to the transferee of the beneficial interests of such Initial Securities or Private Exchange Securities.

At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive Securities, redeemed, repurchased or canceled, the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security shall be reduced, and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global Security) with respect to such Global Security, by the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.

Interest
                        (a)  NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above.  The Company will pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2009.  Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from January 15, 2009.  Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate per annum borne by the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Securities to the extent lawful.
                        (b)  .

Capitalized terms used in this paragraph (b) but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Agreement.  In the event that (i) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date which is 180 days following the date of the original issuance of the Securities, (ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective within 270 days after the original issuance of the Securities, (iii) if the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective, the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to 300 days after the date of the original issuance of Securities, (iv) if the Company is required to file the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the Registration Agreement, the Company does not so file the Shelf Registration Statement on or prior to the 45th day after the Company's obligation to file such Shelf Registration Statement arises, (v) if the Company is required to file the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the Registration Agreement, the Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to 90 days after the filing obligation arises, or (vi) any Suspension Periods exceed, in the aggregate, 45 days during any 365-day period (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (v), a "Registration Default"), the Company shall be obligated to pay Additional Interest from and including the date on which the first such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate of 0.25% per annum on the applicable principal amount of Securities held by such Holder for the first 90day period immediately following the occurrence of a Registration Default, and such rate will increase by an additional 0.25% with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, that the maximum additional rate may in no event exceed 0.50% per annum.

Indenture
U.S.C.
                        The Securities are unsubordinated, unsecured obligations of the Company.  This Security is one of the Original Securities referred to in the Indenture issued in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000.  The Securities include the Original Securities, an unlimited aggregate principal amount of additional Initial Securities that may be issued under the Indenture, and any Exchange Securities issued in exchange for Initial Securities.  The Original Securities, such additional Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities are treated as a single class of securities under the Indenture.  The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, among other things, create or incur Liens or Funded Debt. The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the property of the Company.
5. 
Optional Redemption
                        The Securities will be redeemable as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Securities and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, plus in each case accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.

8.  
Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders upon Change of Control
                        If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Securities at a repurchase price (the "Repurchase Price") in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Securities repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities repurchased to, but not including, the Repurchase Date. A "Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Securities, each of which is defined in the Indenture. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to a Change of Control, but after the public announcement of a Change of Control, the Company will mail, or cause to be mailed, a notice to each Holder of the Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer the "Repurchase Offer" and such date the "Repurchase Date"), which Repurchase Date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Repurchase Offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the Repurchase Date.
                        The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflict.
                        On the Repurchase Date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
                        (1)        accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Repurchase Offer;
                        (2)        deposit with the Trustee or with such paying agent as the Trustee may designate (the "Paying Agent") an amount equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price for all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and
                        (3)        deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities being repurchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Securities pursuant to the Repurchase offer have been complied with.
                        The Trustee will promptly mail, or cause the Paying Agent promptly to mail, to each Holder of Securities, or portions of Securities, properly tendered the Repurchase Price for such Securities, or portions of Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities surrendered, as applicable; provided that each new Security will be in a principal amount of an integral multiple of $1,000.
                        The Company will not be required to make a Repurchase Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. 
                        The Company may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.
9.  
Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
                        The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000.

Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture.  The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Securities to be redeemed or 15 days before an Interest Payment Date.
10.  
Persons Deemed Owners
                        The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
11.  
Unclaimed Money
                        If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person.  After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
12.  
Discharge
                        Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
13.  
Amendment, Waiver
                        The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Security; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of principal of an OID Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security (or premium, if any, thereon) or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date); or (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture or to any waiver of compliance with certain provisions or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; or (iii) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to supplemental indentures that require consent of Holders, the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived, without the consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Security affected thereby, provided, however, that the consent of the Holders shall not be required with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" in Sections 9.02 and 4.09 of the Indenture or with respect to the deletion of this proviso from the Indenture, in accordance with Sections 7.08 and 9.01(b) of the Indenture.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities, to waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Securities, and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Security or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected.  Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange therefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
14.  
Defaults and Remedies
                        If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Securities to be immediately due and payable.  Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default and shall result in the Securities being immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any further act of the Trustee or any Holder.
                        Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it.  Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
15.  
Trustee Dealings with the Company
                        Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA,  the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16.  
No Recourse Against Others
                        A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
17.  
Successors
                        Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, when a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
18.  
Authentication
                        This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
19.

20.  
Governing Law

21.  
CUSIP Numbers
                        Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders.  No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
                        The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge to the Holder a copy of the Indenture which has in it the text of this Security.

Notice of Redemption
                        Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at his or her registered address.  Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000.

8.  
Repurchase of Securities at the Option of Holders upon Change of Control
                        If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Securities at a repurchase price (the "Repurchase Price") in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Securities repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities repurchased to, but not including, the Repurchase Date. A "Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Securities, each of which is defined in the Indenture. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to a Change of Control, but after the public announcement of a Change of Control, the Company will mail, or cause to be mailed, a notice to each Holder of the Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer the "Repurchase Offer" and such date the "Repurchase Date"), which Repurchase Date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Repurchase Offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the Repurchase Date.
                        The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflict.
                        On the Repurchase Date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
                        (1)        accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Repurchase Offer;
                        (2)        deposit with the Trustee or with such paying agent as the Trustee may designate (the "Paying Agent") an amount equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price for all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and
                        (3)        deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities being repurchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Securities pursuant to the Repurchase offer have been complied with.
                        The Trustee will promptly mail, or cause the Paying Agent promptly to mail, to each Holder of Securities, or portions of Securities, properly tendered the Repurchase Price for such Securities, or portions of Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities surrendered, as applicable; provided that each new Security will be in a principal amount of an integral multiple of $1,000.
                        The Company will not be required to make a Repurchase Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. 
                        The Company may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.
9.  
Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
                        The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000.  A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture.  Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture.  The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days prior to the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed or 15 days before an Interest Payment Date.
10.  
Persons Deemed Owners
                        The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
11.  
Unclaimed Money
                        If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person.  After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
12.  
Discharge
                        Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
13.  
Amendment, Waiver
                        The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Security; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of principal of an OID Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security (or premium, if any, thereon) or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date); or (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture or to any waiver of compliance with certain provisions or certain defaults thereunder and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; or (iii) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to supplemental indentures that require consent of Holders, the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of certain covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived, without the consent of the Holders of each Outstanding Security affected thereby, provided, however, that the consent of the Holders shall not be required with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" in Sections 9.02 and 4.09 of the Indenture or with respect to the deletion of this proviso from the Indenture, in accordance with Sections 7.08 and 9.01(b) of the Indenture.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities, to waive any past Default under the Indenture with respect to the Securities, and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Security or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected.  Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange therefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
14.  
Defaults and Remedies
                        If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Securities to be immediately due and payable.  Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default and shall result in the Securities being immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any further act of the Trustee or any Holder.
                        Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it.  Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
15.  
Trustee Dealings with the Company
                        Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA,  the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16.  
No Recourse Against Others
                        A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
17.  
Successors
                        Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, when a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
 
18.  
Authentication
                        This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
19.  
Abbreviations
                        Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
20.  
Governing Law
                        THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.
21.  
CUSIP Numbers
                        Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders.  No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
                        The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge to the Holder a copy of the Indenture which has in it the text of this Security.

Name:_________________________
Address:_______________________
Taxpayer ID Number:_____________
                        The undersigned represents and warrants to you that:
                        1.  We are an institutional "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), purchasing for our own account or for the account of such an institutional "accredited investor" at least $250,000 principal amount of the Securities, and we are acquiring the Securities not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution in violation of the Securities Act.  We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the Securities, and we invest in or purchase securities similar to the Securities in the normal course of our business.  We, and any accounts for which we are acting, are each able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment.
                        2.  We understand that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and, unless so registered, may not be sold except as permitted in the following sentence.  We agree on our own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which we are purchasing Securities to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Securities prior to the date that is six months after the later of the date of original issue and the last date on which the Company or any affiliate of the Company was the owner of such Securities (or any predecessor thereto) (the "Resale Restriction Termination Date") only (a) to the Company, (b) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) in a transaction complying with the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"), to a person we reasonably believe is a qualified institutional buyer under Rule 144A (a "QIB") that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of a QIB and to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, (e) to an institutional "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of such an institutional "accredited investor," in each case in a minimum principal amount of Securities of $100,000, or (f) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of our property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within our or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws.  The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.  If any resale or other transfer of the Securities is proposed to be made pursuant to clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date, the transferor shall deliver a letter from the transferee substantially in the form of this letter to the Company and the Trustee, which shall provide, among other things, that the transferee is an institutional "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act and that it is acquiring such Securities for investment purposes and not for distribution in violation of the Securities Act.  Each purchaser acknowledges that the Company and the Trustee reserve the right prior to the offer, sale or other transfer prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Securities pursuant to clause (d), (e) or (f) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications or other information satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee.

                      (u)       cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with FINRA and, in the case of a Shelf Registration, in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter and its counsel (including any "qualified independent underwriter" that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of FINRA).
                      In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may (as a condition to such Holder's participation in the Shelf Registration) require each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Transfer Restricted Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.
                      In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of (i) the happening of any event or the discovery of any facts, each of the kind described in Section 3(e)(v) or 3(e)(vi) hereof, or (ii) the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company that the continued effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement and use of the Prospectus would require disclosure of confidential information related to a material acquisition or divestiture of assets or a material corporate transaction, event or development, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(k) hereof, and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at its expense) all copies in such Holder's possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice; that the Company shall not allow the Shelf Registration Statement to fail or cease to be effective or allow the Prospectus to be unusable pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph for more than 45 days during any year of effectiveness contemplated by Section 2 hereof.  It is understood and agreed that the provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the Company's obligations under Section 2.5 of this Agreement.
provided
                      In the event that the Company fails to effect the Exchange Offer or file any Shelf Registration Statement and maintain the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement as provided herein, the Company shall not file any Registration Statement with respect to any securities (within the meaning of Section 2(1) of the 1933 Act) of the Company other than Transfer Restricted Securities.

No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

Indemnification; Contribution
                   (a) With respect to the Securities, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers, each Holder, each Participating Broker-Dealer, each Person who participates as an underwriter (any such Person being an "") and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder or Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act with respect to the Securities as follows:
Underwriter
                        (i)  against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Notes or Transfer Restricted Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
                       
                        (ii)  against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission;  provided that (subject to Section 4(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
 
                        (iii)  against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by any indemnified party), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Holder or Underwriter expressly for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
                      (b)       Each Holder severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Purchasers, each Underwriter and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Purchasers, any Underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 4(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such Holder furnished to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); , that no such Holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement.
provided
,
however
                      (c)       Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
                      (d)       If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
                       (e)        If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Purchasers of the Securities on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
            The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Holders or the Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
            The Company, the Holders and the Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
            Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Purchaser or Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser or Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission with respect to the Securities from the sale of the Securities.
            No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
            For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls a Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Purchaser or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A to the Purchase Agreement and not joint.
                      5.         .
Miscellaneous
                      5.1       .  For so long as the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15 of the 1934 Act, the Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the 1933 Act and Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder.  If the Company ceases to be so required to file such reports, the Company covenants that it will upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (a) make publicly available such information as is necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, (b) deliver such information to a prospective purchaser as is necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act and it will take such further action as any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may reasonably request, and (c) take such further action that is reasonable in the circumstances, in each case, to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell its Transfer Restricted Securities without registration under the 1933 Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, (ii) Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (iii) any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted by the SEC.  Upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.
Rule 144 and Rule 144A
                      5.2       .  The Company has not entered into and the Company will not after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.  The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not and will not for the term of this Agreement in any way conflict with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's other issued and outstanding securities under any such agreements.
No Inconsistent Agreements
                      5.3       .  The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or departure.
Amendments and Waivers
                      5.4       .  All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, registered first-class mail, telex, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4, which address initially is the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Purchasers; and (b) if to the Company, initially at the Company's address set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and thereafter at such other address of which notice is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4.
Notices
                      All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given:  at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; two business days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next business day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.
                     
                     Copies of all such notices, demands, or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the person giving the same to the Trustee under the Indenture, at the address specified in such Indenture.
                      5.5       .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture.  If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions on resale set forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Purchase Agreement, and such person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.
Successor and Assigns
provided
                      5.6       .  The Purchasers (even if the Purchasers are not Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities) shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect their rights or the rights of Holders hereunder.  Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights hereunder.
Third Party Beneficiaries
                      5.7.      .  Without limiting the remedies available to the Purchasers and the Holders, the Company acknowledges that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Sections 2.1 through 2.4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it would not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Sections 2.1 through 2.4 hereof.
Specific Enforcement
            5.8.      .  The Company will not, and will cause their "affiliates"" (as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1) under the 1933 Act) not to, resell any Securities which are "restricted securities" (as such term is defined under Rule 144(a)(3) under the 1933 Act) that have been reacquired by any of them and shall immediately upon any purchase of any such Securities submit such Securities to the Trustee for cancellation.
Restriction on Resales
                      5.9       .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
