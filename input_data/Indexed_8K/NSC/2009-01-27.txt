            "Norfolk Southern delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter, despite economic conditions that reduced freight volumes," said CEO Wick Moorman.  "While it is unclear how long the downturn will last, long-term trends point to freight railroads as the preferred way to move goods and relieve highway congestion.  We will continue to make investments in our company and, in 2009, plan to invest $1.4 billion in capital improvements to maintain the safety and quality of our franchise, improve operational efficiency and service, and support the business growth we expect in future years."
