The inspectors of election shall determine the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies and the results of ballots.
           SECTION 8.  .

If it is determined that any such transmission is valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon which they relied.  Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
