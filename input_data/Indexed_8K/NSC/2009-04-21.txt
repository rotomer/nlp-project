Railway operating revenues were $1.9 billion.
 -        
Income from railway operations was $383 million.
 -

NORFOLK, VA. - For the first quarter of 2009, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) reported net income of $177 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with $291 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2008.
            "Current economic conditions were clearly reflected in Norfolk Southern's first-quarter results," said Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman.  "We are responding by aggressively controlling costs, while enhancing our service and continuing to invest in projects that will drive future growth.  This approach will position us to participate in the economy's eventual recovery as we tightly manage the company in the face of an ongoing reduction in railway traffic volumes."
            First-quarter railway operating revenues were $1.9 billion, down 22 percent, compared with the first-quarter of 2008, primarily as the result of a 20 percent reduction in traffic volume and lower fuel-related revenues.
            General merchandise revenues were $975 million, 28 percent lower compared with the same period last year.  Coal revenues declined 9 percent to $602 million compared with first-quarter 2008 results.  Intermodal revenues decreased 25 percent to $366 million compared with the first quarter of last year.
Railway operating expenses for the quarter were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 19 percent over the same period of 2008.
           
            The railway operating ratio was 80.3 percent, compared with 76.9 percent during first-quarter 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
 
1.   EARNINGS PER SHARE   
In the first quarter of 2009, NS adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) EITF No. 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities, which requires the treatment of unvested stock options receiving dividend equivalents as participating securities in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.  NS has retrospectively applied the provisions of this FSP.  Accordingly, for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for both 2009 and 2008 reflects a $2 million reduction from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.  In addition, for the first quarter 2009, diluted earnings per share was calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million reduction from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
 
2.   Stock Repurchase Program   
In March 2007, NS' Board of Directors amended the stock repurchase program that was authorized in November 2005 so as to increase the number of shares of NS common stock that may be repurchased from 50 million to 75 million.  In addition, the term of the program was shortened from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2010.  During the first three months of 2009, NS did not repurchase any shares of common stock.  Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 64.7 million shares at a total cost of $3.3 billion.
