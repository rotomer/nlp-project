                Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section, Section 2.02 and the authentication order of the Company with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that shall (a) represent and be denominated in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (b) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (c) be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction, and (d) bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of any successor Depositary."
                                                                   
SECTION 2.03. 
Execution and Authentication
.  (a)  An Officer (and for purposes of this Section 2.03, the term Officer shall include any Vice President of the Company authorized by the Board of Directors) shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature.
                        (b)        If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
                        (c)        At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order of the Company shall authenticate and deliver such Securities.  Other than in the case of the Original Securities, such written order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of such Securities shall be in the form of an Officers' Certificate.
                        (d)        A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security.  The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
                        (e)        The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities.  Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so.  Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.  An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.04. 
Registrar and Paying Agent
.  (a)  The Company shall maintain an office or agency in the City of New York where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency in the City of New York where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent").  The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange.  The Company may have one or more coregistrars and one or more additional paying agents.  The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
                        (b)        The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA.  Such agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any such agent.  If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07.  The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, coregistrar or transfer agent.
                        (c)        The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as initial Registrar and initial Paying Agent in connection with the Securities.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.05. 
Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust
.  Prior to each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due.  The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment.  If the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.  The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent.  Upon complying with this Section 2.05, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.06. 
Holder Lists
.  The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders.  If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.07. 
Transfer and Exchange
.  Where a Security (other than a Global Security except as set forth herein) is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested. Where Securities (other than a Global Security except as set forth herein) of any series are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations of the same series with identical terms as the Securities exchanged, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. To permit transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.10 or 3.06 not involving any transfer. The Company shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of Securities of any series for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of the same series to be redeemed or before an interest payment.
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
                None of the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any co-registrar shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
                If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.01, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 2.01 shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
                The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
                If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for the Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver:
                                (a) to each party specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such party in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such party's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
                                (b) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
                Upon the exchange of the Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the parties in whose names such Securities are so registered.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.08. 
Replacement Securities
. 
                        (a)  If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that such Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee.  Such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any coregistrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced.  The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
                        (b)        Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.09. 
Outstanding Securities
. 
                        (a)  Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.09 as not outstanding.  A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
                        (b)        If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
                        (c)        If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.10. 
Temporary Securities
.  Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities.  Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities.  Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.11. 
Cancellation
.  The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation.  The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.  The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and will dispose of all cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company.  The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.12. 
Defaulted Interest
.  If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay the defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner.  The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date.  The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Holder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
                                                                   
SECTION 2.13. 
CUSIP Numbers
.  The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; , , that neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any defect in the "CUSIP" number that appears on any Security, check, advice of payment or redemption notice, and any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP number(s).
provided
however
                                                                                   
ARTICLE III
                                                                                     
Redemption
                                                                   
SECTION 3.01. 
Applicability of this Article
.  Securities of any series that are redeemable prior to their maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms (except as otherwise specified in this Indenture for Securities of any series) and in accordance with this Article III.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.02. 
Notices to Trustee
.  If the Company wants to redeem any Securities, it shall notify the Trustee of the redemption date and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Securities. If the redemption is of less than all the outstanding Securities of a series, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee a written statement signed by an Officer of the Company stating that with respect to that series there exists no Event of Default and no circumstance which, after notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default. The Company shall give the notice provided for in this Section 3.02 at least 45 days before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period.  Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate from the Company to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.03. 
Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed
.  If fewer than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities of such series to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee considers fair and appropriate and in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances.  The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption.  The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $2,000.  Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in amounts of $2,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000.  Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.  The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities  of such series to be redeemed.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.04. 
Notice of Redemption
.  (a)  At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address.

                                (1) the redemption date;
                                (2) the redemption price;
                                (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
                                (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;
                                (5) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and principal amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
                                (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date, and the only remaining right of the Holders is to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender to the Paying Agent; and
                                (7) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
                        (b)        At the Company's written request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense.  In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section 3.03 at least 45 days before the redemption date.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.05. 
Effect of Notice of Redemption
.  Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice.  Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of redemption).  Failure to give notice of any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.06. 
Deposit of Redemption Price

Prior to or by 10:00 a.m., New York City time on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest, if any (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of redemption), on all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption that have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation.
                                                                   
SECTION 3.07. 
Securities Redeemed in Part
.  Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Security equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.
                                                                                 
ARTICLE IV
                                                                                   
Covenants

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture.
                                                                   
SECTION 4.02. 
Maintenance of Office or Agency

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
                        (b)        The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for the Securities for such purposes.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; , , that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.

                                (3) the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding and has not received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, within 60 days after such notice, request and offer.
                        (b)        The foregoing limitations on the pursuit of remedies by a Holder shall not apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or interest on such Security on or after the applicable due date specified in such Security. A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).

                        (c)        A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.

                                (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; or

The Trustee may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities of any series without notice to or consent of any Securityholder of such series if the waiver does not materially adversely affect the rights of any Holder of any Securities of that series.
                                                                   
SECTION 9.02. 
Amendments and Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders
.  The Company may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities with respect to any series without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series affected and the Trustee shall execute any such amendment or supplement at the direction of the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series affected may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities of such series without notice to any Securityholder. However, without the consent of each Securityholder of such series affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.04, may not:
                                (1) reduce the amount of Securities of such series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; or
                                (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security of such series; or

                                (5) make any Security of such series payable in money other than that stated in such Security.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement or amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

SECTION 9.04. 
Revocation and Effect of Consents
.  A consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of the Security. The Trustee must receive the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.
                After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder unless it makes a change described in clauses (2), (3), (4) or (5) of Section 9.2. In that case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
                                                                   
SECTION 9.05. 
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
.  If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determine, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.
                                                                   
SECTION 9.06. 
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
.  The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment, supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment, supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment, supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Company shall not sign an amendment or supplement unless authorized by an appropriate Board Resolution.

Repurchase of Notes at the Option of Holders upon Change of Control
                                If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Notes, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Notes at a repurchase price (the "Repurchase Price") in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the Repurchase Date. A "Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Notes, each of which is defined in the Indenture. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to a Change of Control, but after the public announcement of a Change of Control, the Company will mail, or cause to be mailed, a notice to each Holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer the "Repurchase Offer" and such date the "Repurchase Date"), which Repurchase Date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Repurchase Offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the Repurchase Date.
                                The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
                                On the Repurchase Date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
                                (1)        accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Repurchase Offer;
                                (2)        deposit with the Trustee or with such paying agent as the Trustee may designate (the "") an amount equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price for all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
Paying Agent
                                (3)        deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted, together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being repurchased by the Company pursuant to the Repurchase Offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Notes pursuant to the Repurchase offer have been complied with.
                                The Trustee will promptly mail, or cause the Paying Agent promptly to mail, to each Holder of Notes, or portions of Notes, properly tendered the Repurchase Price for such Notes, or portions of Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered, as applicable; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of an integral multiple of $1,000.
                                The Company will not be required to make a Repurchase Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. 
                                The Company may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture.  Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture.

11.  
Unclaimed Money
                                If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its written request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person.  After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
12.  
Discharge
                                Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time may terminate its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
13.  
Amendment, Waiver
                                The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes affected, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Note; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) reduce the amount of Notes of such series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; or (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Notes of such series; or (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the fixed maturity of any Notes of such series; (iv) reduce the portion of the principal amount of an OID Note of such series payable upon acceleration of its maturity; or (v) make any Note of such series payable in money other than that stated in such Note.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes of such series affected, provided that such waiver shall not affect the above provisions (i) - (v).
14.  
Defaults and Remedies
                                If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Notes to be immediately due and payable.  Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default and shall result in the Notes being immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of such Events of Default without any further act of the Trustee or any Holder.
                                Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it.  Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind any declaration of acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
15.  
Trustee Dealings with the Company
                                Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA,  the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
16.  
No Recourse Against Others
                                A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  By accepting a Note, each Noteholder waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
17.  
Successors
                                Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, when a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Notes and the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
18.  
Authentication
                                This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.

No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

            (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Underwriter or such director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto)or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such director, officer, employee, agent and controlling person for any and all expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; , that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have. The term "Underwriter Information" shall mean written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus and/or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).  The Company hereby acknowledges that Underwriter Information shall consist only of the statements set forth in the third sentence of paragraph seven and the eighth, ninth and tenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Underwriters. 
provided, however
(b)  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with Underwriter Information; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Underwriter may otherwise have.
Indemnification of the Company, its Directors and Officers. 
             (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party, unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed promptly to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or any affiliate of the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that either (x) there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party or (y) a conflict may exist between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party or such affiliate of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to a single firm of local counsel) for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by BAS and that all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).  Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. 
 (d)  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  
Settlements. 
Section 9.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution. 
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A.  For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee  and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
Section 10.  If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such Notes set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters. 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10.  Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
Section 11.  Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the NYSE, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any material adverse change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Termination of this Agreement. 
Section 12.  .  The Company acknowledges and agrees that:  (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Notes and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm'slength commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
No Fiduciary Duty
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in conjunction with any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto.
            Section 13.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, of its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter, or any person controlling the Underwriter, the Company, the officers or employees of the Company, or any person controlling the Company, as the case may be or (B) acceptance of the Notes and payment for them hereunder and (ii) will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes sold hereunder and any termination of this Agreement.

(i)   The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its property requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(ii)  The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. 
(iii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, when they were filed with the Commission appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements, related schedules and other financial data, and such counsel need not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented. 
(iv) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
(v)  Each of the Transaction Documents, when executed, will have been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
(vi) The issuance and sale of the Notes have been duly authorized by the Company, and, when executed, issued and delivered by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, except (a) to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (b) that such counsel need express no opinion as to Section 6.12 of the Indenture.
(vii) The Indenture, when executed and delivered by the Company and the Trustee (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee), will be a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except (a) to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (b) that such counsel need express no opinion as to Section 6.12 of the Indenture.
                        (viii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge: (a) there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which would be required to be described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus which are not so described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (b) no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
(ix) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated by, each of the Transaction Documents do not and will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company or NSR pursuant to the terms of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or NSR is a party or by which the Company or NSR is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or NSR is subject, other than those conflicts, breaches or defaults that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or violate any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or NSR or any of their properties, other than those violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, except that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to state securities or Blue Sky laws or the laws of any foreign jurisdiction or with respect to the rights to indemnity and contribution under the Underwriting Agreement.
(x) No authorization, approval, consent or order of, and no filing, qualification or registration with, any court or governmental authority is required on the part of the Company for the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of each Transaction Document, including without limitation the issuance and sale of the Notes, other than registration or qualification under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
(xi) The statements set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities," insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
(xii) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, that automatically became effective not more than three years prior to the Execution Time; the Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration form.
(xiii) The Registration Statement, including without limitation the Rule 430B Information, the Prospectus, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of their respective effective or issue dates (including without limitation each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the Securities Act), other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1"), as to which such counsel need express no opinion, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.
                        Nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, including the information required under Rule 430B of the Securities Act (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data  included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Form T-1, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of its original effective date and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriter pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the Securities Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Disclosure Package (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of the Initial Sale Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, to which such counsel need make no statement), as of the date of the Prospectus, as of the date of any such amended or supplemented prospectus or as of the date hereof, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In rendering the opinion required under this Exhibit A, counsel to the Company need not express any opinion concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America, provided that such counsel states that he is aware of no difference between the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the laws of the State of New York which would cause him to believe that his opinion would be inapplicable if it were furnished in connection with the laws of the State of New York.  In addition, in rendering the opinion required under this Exhibit A, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems it proper, on certificates of responsible officials of the Company and public officials.
