 -        
Income from railway operations was $468 million.
 -

NORFOLK, VA. - For the second quarter of 2009, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) reported net income of $247 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared with $453 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2008.
            "Second-quarter results obviously reflect the impact of the recession," said Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman.  "However, the measures we are taking to control expenses while maintaining our industry-leading service levels have enabled us to post solid second-quarter results, while at the same time we continue to invest in projects that position us for the eventual economic recovery."
            Second-quarter railway operating revenues were $1.9 billion, down 33 percent, compared with the second quarter of 2008, primarily the result of a 26 percent reduction in traffic volume and lower fuel-related revenues.
            General merchandise revenues were $978 million, 33 percent lower compared with the same period last year.  Coal revenues declined 34 percent to $511 million compared with second-quarter 2008 results. Intermodal revenues decreased 31 percent to $368 million compared with the second quarter of last year.
Railway operating expenses for the quarter were $1.4 billion, a decrease of 29 percent over the same period of 2008.
           
The railway operating ratio was 74.8 percent, compared with 71.1 percent during second-quarter 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.    Materials and Other
Second quarter 2009 includes a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute.
 
2.    Stock Repurchase Program   
In March 2007, NS' Board of Directors amended the stock repurchase program that was authorized in November 2005 so as to increase the number of shares of NS common stock that may be repurchased from 50 million to 75 million.  In addition, the term of the program was shortened from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2010.  During the first six months of 2009, NS did not repurchase any shares of common stock.  Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 64.7 million shares at a total cost of $3.3 billion.
 
3.    Earnings Per Share   
In the first quarter of 2009, NS adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) EITF No. 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities," which requires the treatment of unvested stock options receiving dividend equivalents as participating securities in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.  NS has retrospectively applied the provisions of this FSP.  Accordingly, for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the second quarter 2009 and 2008 reflects a $2 million reduction and for the first six months of 2009 and 2008 a $4 million reduction from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.  In addition, for the second quarter and first six months of 2009, diluted earnings per share was calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million and $4 million reduction, respectively, from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
