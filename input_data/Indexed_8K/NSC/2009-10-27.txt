NORFOLK, VA. - For the third quarter of 2009, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) reported net income of $303 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared with $520 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008.
 
            "While our third-quarter results reflect the continuing weak economy, they also show Norfolk Southern's resilience and the strength of our franchise," said Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman.  "By controlling costs and maintaining service levels, we are managing through this economic downturn and will emerge an even stronger company."
 
            Third-quarter railway operating revenues were $2.1 billion, down 29 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2008, primarily the result of a 20 percent reduction in traffic volume and lower fuel-related revenues.
 
            General merchandise revenues were $1.1 billion, 24 percent lower compared with the same period last year.  Coal revenues declined 35 percent to $571 million compared with third-quarter 2008 results.  Intermodal revenues decreased 31 percent to $389 million compared with the third quarter of last year.
           
Railway operating expenses for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 25 percent over the same period of 2008.
           
 
The railway operating ratio was 72.8 percent, compared with 69.1 percent during third-quarter 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.   COAL REVENUES
Third quarter 2008 includes $22 million related to a coal customer's 2008 contracted volume shortfall and a nonrecurring effect related to the implementation of NS' new export coal billing system.
 
2.   LABOR AGREEMENT
Third quarter 2008 includes $28 million for lump-sum payments (including payroll taxes) due under a new labor agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET).
 
3.   MATERIALS AND OTHER
Second quarter 2009 includes a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute.
 
4.   EARNINGS PER SHARE
In the first quarter of 2009, NS adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) EITF No. 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities" (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10), which requires the treatment of unvested stock options receiving dividend equivalents as participating securities in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.  NS has retrospectively applied the provisions of this FSP.  Accordingly, for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the third quarter 2009 and 2008 reflects a $2 million and $3 million reduction, respectively, and for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 a $6 million and $7 million reduction, respectively, from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.  In addition, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, diluted earnings per share was calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million and $6 million reduction, respectively, from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
 
5.   STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2007, NS' Board of Directors amended the stock repurchase program that was authorized in November 2005 so as to increase the number of shares of NS common stock that may be repurchased from 50 million to 75 million.  In addition, the term of the program was shortened from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2010.  During the first nine months of 2009, NS did not repurchase any shares of common stock.  Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 64.7 million shares at a total cost of $3.3 billion.
