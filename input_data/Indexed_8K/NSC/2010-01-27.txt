"Our fourth-quarter results demonstrate a continuation of the momentum we have generated since the second quarter of 2009," said CEO Wick Moorman.

"We expect to built upon the sequential volume gains we saw in the third and fourth quarters driven by anticipated improvement in economic conditions combined with project growth. We plan to invest about $1.4 billion, slightly higher than our 2009 capital spending, in our rail network in 2010, including leveraging technology to improve operational efficiency and service, and support the business growth we expect in future years."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
 
1.   Coal Revenues   
2008 includes $22 million related to a coal customer's 2008 contracted volume shortfall and a nonrecurring effect related to the implementation of NS' new export coal billing system.
 
2.   Labor Agreement
2008 includes $31 million for lump-sum payments (including payroll taxes) due under a new labor agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET).
 
3.   Materials and Other
2009 includes a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute.
 
4.   Earnings Per Share   
In the first quarter of 2009, NS adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) EITF No. 03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities" (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10), which requires the treatment of unvested stock options receiving dividend equivalents as participating securities in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.  NS has retrospectively applied the provisions of this FSP.  Accordingly, for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the fourth quarter 2009 and 2008 reflects a $2 million reduction, and for the years 2009 and 2008 an $8 million and $9 million reduction, respectively, from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.  In addition, for the fourth quarter and year 2009, diluted earnings per share was calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million and $8 million reduction, respectively, from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
 
5.   Stock Repurchase Program   
In March 2007, NS' Board of Directors amended the stock repurchase program that was authorized in November 2005 so as to increase the number of shares of NS common stock that may be repurchased from 50 million to 75 million.  In addition, the term of the program was shortened from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2010.  During 2009, NS did not repurchase any shares of common stock.  Since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 64.7 million shares at a total cost of $3.3 billion.
