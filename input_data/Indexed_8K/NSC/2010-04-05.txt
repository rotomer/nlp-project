Item 8.01.     Other Events.
As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) signed into law on March 23, 2010, including modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signed into law on March 30, 2010, Norfolk Southern intends to take a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D subsidy.  Under the new legislation, to the extent the Corporation's future health care drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program, the reimbursed expenses will no longer be tax deductible after 2012.  Since the deferred tax effects for retiree health care liabilities are reflected in the Corporation's financial statements, the entire impact of this tax change relating to the future retiree drug costs must be recorded in tax expense in the period in which the legislation is enacted.  As a result, the Corporation's income tax expense is expected to be approximately $27 million higher in the first quarter.
