2.    EARNINGS PER SHARE
As required under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10, "Earnings Per Share," for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the second quarters of 2010 and 2009 reflects a $2 million reduction and for the first six months of 2010 and 2009 a $4 million reduction from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.   In addition, for the second quarters and first six months of 2010 and 2009, diluted earnings per share were calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million and $4 million reduction, respectively, from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
