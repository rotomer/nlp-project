NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.   MATERIALS AND OTHER
Second quarter 2009 includes a $21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute.
 
2.   DEFERRED TAXES
During the fourth quarter of 2010, NS recognized a $34 million non-recurring benefit resulting from a change in estimate for deferred taxes.  During the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Provisions of these Acts eliminate, after 2012, the tax deduction available for reimbursed prescription drug expenses under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.  As required by ASC 740, "Income Taxes," NS recorded a $27 million charge to deferred tax expense.
 
3.   EARNINGS PER SHARE   
As required under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260-10, "Earnings Per Share," for basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 reflects a $2 million reduction and for the years 2010 and 2009 an $8 million reduction from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.  In addition, for the fourth quarters and years 2010 and 2009, diluted earnings per share were calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to the treasury stock method) and income available to common stockholders reflects a $2 million and $8 million reduction, respectively, from net income for dividend equivalent payments.
 
4.   STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  
On July 27, 2010, NS' Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation common stock (Common Stock) through December 31, 2014.  During 2010, NS purchased and retired 14.7 million shares of Common Stock at a cost of $863 million.  Since inception of the share repurchase program, NS has repurchased and retired 79.4 million shares at a total cost of $4.1 billion.
