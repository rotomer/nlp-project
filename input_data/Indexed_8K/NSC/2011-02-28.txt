Election of New Director
            On February 28, 2011, Norfolk Southern issued a Press Release, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, announcing that on February 28, 2011, the Board of Directors elected Erskine Bowles to be a director of the Corporation, effective immediately.  The Board of Directors also appointed Mr. Bowles to the Finance and Compensation Committees. 
            Mr. Bowles, 65, of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, has been a Senior Advisor to Carousel Capital since 2001 and is Co-Chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.  He is currently a director of Morgan Stanley and Cousins Properties, Inc.  Mr. Bowles was President of the University of North Carolina system from 2006 to 2010, and previously served as White House Chief of Staff under President Clinton.  Mr. Bowles was formerly a director of General Motors, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Merck & Co., Inc., and VF Corporation.
There was no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Bowles and any other person pursuant to which he was elected as a director of Norfolk Southern.
During 2010, the Corporation interchanged traffic with the L&C Railway ("L&C"), which is a shortline railroad.  Mr. Bowles' wife and her immediate family owned substantially all of L&C directly and indirectly through a series of family trusts.  The Corporation paid L&C $3.8 million in interchange fees and related fuel surcharges through November 2010.  Mr. Bowles' wife and her immediate family sold the L&C operating assets in November 2010, prior to Mr. Bowles' election as a Norfolk Southern director.  This transaction was considered and approved in accordance with Norfolk Southern's policy regarding related person transactions.
No material plan, contract or arrangement (whether or not written) to which Mr. Bowles is a party or a participant was entered into or materially amended in connection with his joining the Board of Directors, and, other than as discussed below, Mr. Bowles did not receive any grant or award or any modification thereto, under any such plan, contract or arrangement in connection with such event. 
Under the terms of the Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan, Mr. Bowles received a grant of 3,000 restricted shares upon his election to the Board.  These shares will be registered in Mr. Bowles' name, and he will have all rights of ownership (including the right to vote the shares and receive dividends); however, these shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise encumbered during a restriction period which began on the date of grant and ends on the earlier of Mr. Bowles' death or six months after he becomes disabled or retires.  In the event Mr. Bowles does not retire in accordance with the terms of the plan, these shares will be forfeited.  In addition, Mr. Bowles will receive compensation consistent with that provided to all non-employee directors, as described in the Narrative to Non-Employee Director Compensation Table contained on pages 35-37 of Norfolk Southern Corporation's Proxy Statement dated March 22, 2010.
Item 5.03.  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Bylaw Amendment
             On February 28, 2011, the Board of Directors amended the Bylaws of Norfolk Southern Corporation, effective immediately, to increase the number of directors from 12 to 13 until the date of the 2011 Annual Meeting, at which time the number of directors shall be reduced to eleven.  The amended Bylaws are attached hereto as Exhibit 3(ii).

                           SECTION 1.  .  The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation shall be held on such date in March, April, May or June as the board of directors may designate.  If the date of the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding day not a legal holiday.
Annual Meeting
                           SECTION 2.  .  Special meetings of the stockholders shall be held whenever called by the chief executive officer or by a majority of the directors.
Special Meetings
                           SECTION 3.  .  All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the time and place stated in the notice of meeting.
Time and Place
                           SECTION 4.  .  The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the stockholders.  If less than a quorum is present at an annual or special meeting, then a majority in interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy may from time to time adjourn the meeting to a fixed time and place, no further notice of any adjourned meeting being required.  Each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share entitled to vote then outstanding in his name on the books of the corporation.
Quorum
                           SECTION 5.  .  The board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for a determination of stockholders for any purpose, such date to be not more than seventy days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of stockholders.
Record Date
                           SECTION 6.  .  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation, under any provision of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, the articles of incorporation or these bylaws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given.  Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary of the corporation or any assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.  Notice given pursuant to this Section shall be deemed given:  (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting when such notice is directed to the record address of the stockholder or to such other address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, upon the later of such posting or the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when consented to by the stockholder.
Electronic Transmission of Notice
provided, however,
                           SECTION 7.  .  The chief executive officer, or any officer or director he may designate, shall preside over all meetings of the stockholders as chairman.  The chairman shall be authorized to declare whether any business is properly brought before a meeting, and, if he or she shall declare that it is not so brought, such business shall not be transacted.  The chairman of the meeting, at his or her discretion, may adjourn the meeting from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, and may determine the date, time and place that a meeting so adjourned is to reconvene.  The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the maintenance of order and safety, limitation on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.  The secretary of the corporation, or an assistant secretary, shall act as secretary of all the meetings, if present.  If the secretary or an assistant secretary is not present, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary.
Conduct of Meetings
                           The board of directors, prior to the annual meeting of the stockholders each year, shall appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at such annual meeting and at all other meetings of stockholders held during the ensuing year.  In the event of the failure of the board to make such appointment or if any inspector of election shall for any reason fail to attend and to act at such meeting, an inspector or inspectors of election, as the case may be, may be appointed by the chairman of the meeting.  The inspectors of election shall determine the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies and the results of ballots.
                           SECTION 8.  .  A stockholder or a stockholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, internet transmission, telephone transmission or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the inspectors of election can determine that the transmission was authorized by the stockholder or the stockholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact.  If it is determined that any such transmission is valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon which they relied.  Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
Electronic Authorization
                           SECTION 9.  .  No business may be transacted at an annual or special meeting of stockholders other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder (i) who is a stockholder on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 9 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who gives to the corporation notice in writing of the proposal, provided that such written notice is received at the principal executive office of the corporation, addressed to the secretary of the corporation, (A) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) nor more than one hundred sixty (160) calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and, (B) in the case of a special meeting, not later than the tenth calendar day next following the date on which notice of the holding of the special meeting is mailed to stockholders or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs.  Clause (c) of this Section 9, Article I, shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to submit business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and included in the corporation's notice of meeting) before an annual or special meeting.  The written notice given to the corporation shall include (i) the specific language on which stockholders will be asked to vote, (ii) the name and address of such stockholder, (iii) (A) the class or series and number of shares of the capital stock of the corporation which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and/or of record by such stockholder and any Stockholder Affiliate (as defined below) and (B) any derivative positions with respect to the corporation's securities held or beneficially held by the proposing stockholder and any Stockholder Affiliate and whether and to the extent to which the proposing stockholder or Stockholder Affiliate is, or within the preceding twelve months was, a party to or participant in any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of such stockholder or any Stockholder Affiliate with respect to the corporation's securities, (iv) a representation as to the existence and nature of any agreement or understanding between the proposing stockholder and any Stockholder Affiliate (including the identity(ies) of any Stockholder Affiliate) in connection with bringing the proposal, and (v) a representation as to any material interest of the proposing stockholder and any Stockholder Affiliate in the subject matter of the proposal.  The requirements of this Section 9 are in addition to any other applicable requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, if the stockholder (or a designated representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.

In determining whether to accept the offered resignation, the Board of Directors shall consider any recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, the factors considered by that committee and any additional information and factors that the Board of Directors believes to be relevant.  Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Governance and Nominating Committee recommendation or Board of Directors' action regarding whether to accept the offered resignation.

                           All transfers of stock of the corporation held in certificated form shall be made upon its books by surrender of the certificate for the shares transferred accompanied by an assignment in writing by the holder and may be accomplished either by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney in fact.  All transfers of stock of the corporation held in uncertificated form shall be made upon proper instructions from the holder thereof.
                           In case of the loss, mutilation or destruction of a certificate of stock, a duplicate certificate or uncertificated shares in the place of the previously issued certificate may be issued upon such terms not in conflict with law as the board of directors may prescribe.
                           The board of directors may also appoint one or more transfer agents and registrars and may require stock certificates to be countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar or may require stock certificates to be both countersigned by a transfer agent and registered by a registrar. If certificates of capital stock of the corporation are signed by a transfer agent or by a registrar (other than the corporation itself or one of its employees), the signature thereon of the officers of the corporation and the seal of the corporation thereon may be facsimiles, engraved or printed.  In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.
                           The seal of the corporation shall be a flatfaced circular die, of which there may be any number of counterparts, with the word "SEAL" and the name of the corporation and the state and year of incorporation engraved thereon.
                           The fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on the first day of January and end on the thirtyfirst day of December in each year.
                           Unless otherwise ordered by the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or his designee, shall have full power and authority in behalf of the corporation to attend and to act and to vote at any meetings of stockholders of any corporation in which the corporation may hold stock, and at any such meeting shall possess and may exercise any and all the rights and powers incident to the ownership of such stock, which, as the owner thereof, the corporation might have possessed and exercised if present, and may sign proxies on behalf of the corporation with respect to any such meeting or sign consents on behalf of the corporation with respect to corporate actions permitted without a meeting of stockholders.  The board of directors, by resolution, from time to time, may confer like powers upon any other person or persons.
                           These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.
                           Article 14.1 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act ("Control Share Acquisitions") shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of stock of the corporation.
