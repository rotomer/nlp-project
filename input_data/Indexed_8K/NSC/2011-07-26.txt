NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
      During the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by NS, related to the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC.  As a result, NS recorded a $43 million expense for the receivables associated
with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million expense for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.
 
      During the second quarter of 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of NS' 2008 tax return and review of certain claims for refund for prior years that resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $40 million.  Also during the second quarter, three states enacted tax law changes that decreased deferred income tax expense by $19 million.
      During the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Provisions of the Acts eliminated, after 2012, the tax deduction available for reimbursed prescription drug expenses under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.  Accordingly, NS recorded a $27 million charge to deferred tax expense in the first quarter of 2010.
 
      For basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders for the first and second quarters of 2011 and 2010 reflects $2 million each in reductions from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units. 
      For diluted earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions of $2 million for the first quarter of 2011, less than $1 million for the second quarter of 2011, $2 million for both the first and second quarters of 2010, $2 million for the first six months of 2011, and $4 million for the first six months of 2010 for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options.
 
      NS repurchased and retired 11.6 million shares of Common Stock in the first six months of 2011, at a cost of $792 million and 2.0 million shares at a cost of $114 million for the same period of 2010.  The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.  Since 2005, NS has repurchased and retired 91.0 million shares at a total cost of $4.9 billion.
