NORFOLK, VA. -- Norfolk Southern Corporation today reported record fourth-quarter net income of $480 million, 19 percent higher compared with $402 million for the same quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.42, up 30 percent compared with the $1.09 per diluted share earned in the same period a year earlier.
For 2011, net income increased to an all-time record $1.9 billion, 28 percent higher compared with $1.5 billion for 2010.  Diluted earnings per share for the year increased 36 percent, or $1.45, to a record $5.45, compared with 2010.
            "Norfolk Southern achieved all-time records for revenues, operating income, net income, and earnings per share during 2011, and set fourth-quarter records for revenues, net income, and earnings per share," said Norfolk Southern CEO Wick Moorman. "In 2012 we will remain committed to enhancing our service product, maintaining the safety and quality of our rail network, improving operational efficiency, and supporting growth."
            "Our strong capital program of $2.4 billion will include substantial investments along our Crescent Corridor, a public-private partnership to create a high-capacity, truck-competitive intermodal freight rail route between the Gulf Coast and Northeast," Moorman said. "As part of this program of projects, we plan to open intermodal terminals in Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee later in the year. Facilities such as these relieve congested freight lines and highways, and are proven centers for creating jobs and economic development."
            Railway operating revenues increased to $2.8 billion, a fourth-quarter record, up 17 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. For 2011, railway operating revenues set an all-time record $11.2 billion, 17 percent higher compared with 2010. The improvements were the result of increases in revenue per unit of 11 percent for the quarter and 12 percent for the year and higher volumes that were up 6 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the year.

General merchandise revenues rose to $1.4 billion, up 13 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2010. For 2011, general merchandise revenues increased to $5.6 billion, 12 percent higher compared with 2010. Traffic volume increased 1 percent in the quarter and was even for the year compared with the same periods of 2010.
Coal revenues in the fourth quarter were $850 million, up 24 percent compared with the same period last year. For 2011, coal revenues were $3.5 billion, 27 percent higher compared with 2010. Traffic volume increased 3 percent in the quarter and 4 percent for the year compared with the same periods of 2010.
Intermodal revenues were $554 million, up 18 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2010. For the year, intermodal revenues were $2.1 billion, up 19 percent compared with 2010. Traffic volume increased by 11 percent in the quarter and 10 percent for 2011 compared with the same periods of 2010.
            Railway operating expenses were $2 billion for the fourth quarter, 14 percent higher compared with the same period a year earlier. For 2011, railway operating expenses were $8 billion, up 16 percent compared with 2010. The increases were primarily driven by fuel expenses, which rose by $95 million in the fourth quarter and $510 million for the year, and higher costs associated with increased traffic volumes.
            Income from railway operations increased 25 percent for the quarter to $800 million and improved 20 percent to a record $3.2 billion for the year, compared with the same periods of 2010.
            Fourth-quarter 2011 results included $11 million in deferred income tax benefits attributable to state tax law changes.  The year included $68 million of favorable, non-recurring income tax benefits.
            The fourth-quarter railway operating ratio improved by 2 percent to 71.4 percent compared with the same period last year.  For 2011, the railway operating ratio improved by 1 percent to 71.2 percent compared with 2010.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.      MATERIALS AND OTHER   
During the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by NS, related to the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC.  As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.
 
2.      INCOME TAXES
   During the second quarter of 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of NS' 2008 tax return and review of certain claims for refund for prior years that resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $40 million.  Also during the second quarter, three states enacted tax law changes that decreased deferred income tax expense by $19 million.
   During the fourth quarter of 2010, NS recognized a $34 million non-recurring benefit resulting from a change in estimate for deferred taxes.  During the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law.  Provisions of the Acts eliminated, after 2012, the tax deduction available for reimbursed prescription drug expenses under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy program.  Accordingly, NS recorded a $27 million charge to deferred tax expense in the first quarter of 2010.
 
3.      EARNINGS PER SHARE
   For basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the fourth quarter, $3 million in 2011 and $2 million in 2010; and for the year, $9 million in 2011 and $8 million in 2010.
   For diluted earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted units as follows:  for the fourth quarter, less than $1 million in 2011 and $2 million in 2010; and for the year $2 million for 2011 and $8 million for 2010.
 
4.      STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM   
   During 2011, NS repurchased and retired 30.2 million shares of Common Stock at a cost of $2.1 billion and 14.7 million shares at a cost of $863 million for the same period of 2010.  The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.  Since 2005, NS has repurchased and retired 109.6 million shares at a total cost of $6.2 billion.
