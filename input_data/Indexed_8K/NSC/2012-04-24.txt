Norfolk Southern reports first-quarter 2012 results
 
 
For 2012 vs. 2011, Norfolk Southern achieved the following first-quarter records:
 
 
Railway operating revenues increased 6 percent to $2.8 billion.
Income from railway operations improved 24 percent to $745 million.
Net income increased 26 percent to $410 million.
Diluted earnings per share rose 37 percent to $1.23.
NORFOLK, VA. -- For the first quarter of 2012, Norfolk Southern Corporation reported net income of $410 million ($1.23 per diluted share), 26 percent higher than $325 million ($0.90 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2011. First-quarter 2011 results included a $58 million non-cash charge that reduced net income by $36 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.
"I am pleased to report another record-breaking quarter for Norfolk Southern during which we achieved first-quarter highs in revenues, operating income, net income, and earnings per share," said CEO Wick Moorman. "The benefits of our steady focus on service and operating efficiency are reflected in our results, and we continue to position our franchise for sustained growth through strategic investments in infrastructure."
Compared with the first quarter of 2011, in the first quarter of 2012: railway operating revenues improved 6 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily as the result of a 5 percent increase in revenue per unit; general merchandise revenues improved 13 percent to $1.5 billion; coal revenues declined 6 percent to $766 million; and intermodal revenues improved 9 percent to $527 million.
Railway operating expenses for the quarter were $2 billion, up 1 percent compared with first-quarter 2011. The increase was largely due to higher fuel prices, compensation costs, and materials expenses, offset in part by the absence of last year's non-cash charge.

NOTES:
1.   MATERIALS AND OTHER
During the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million) of the claim.  As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery was no longer probable. 
2.   EARNINGS PER SHARE  
For basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the first quarter, $3 million in 2012 and $2 million in 2011.  For diluted earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the first quarter, $2 million in 2012 and 2011.
3.   STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM   
NS repurchased and retired 5.7 million shares of Common Stock in the first quarter of 2012 at a cost of $400 million and 5.3 million shares at a cost of $343 million for the same period of 2011.  The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.  Since the beginning of 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 115.3 million shares at a total cost of $6.6 billion.
