Norfolk Southern reports second-quarter
earnings
 
 
For 2012 vs. 2011, Norfolk Southern achieved the following second-quarter records:
Railway operating revenues were $2.9 billion.
Income from operations improved 7 percent to $934 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased 3 percent to $1.60.
Railway operating ratio improved 2 percentage points to 67.5 percent.
 
NORFOLK, VA. -- For the second quarter of 2012, Norfolk Southern reported net income of $524 million, 6 percent lower than $557 million for the second quarter 2011. Diluted earnings per share were an all-time record $1.60, up 3 percent compared with $1.56 per diluted share in the same period last year. Second-quarter 2011 net income included favorable, non-recurring income tax-related benefits totaling $63 million or $0.18 per diluted share.
"In the second quarter, Norfolk Southern continued to deliver outstanding results. Our income from operations, diluted earnings per share and improved operating ratio all set records, despite the slow economic recovery and softness in our coal franchise," said CEO Wick Moorman. "Our railroad continues to operate extremely well, and that enables us to control costs and operate efficiently while providing high levels of service for our customers."
Railway operating revenues of $2.9 billion were essentially flat in the second quarter compared to 2011. General merchandise revenues improved 9 percent to $1.6 billion. Coal revenues declined 15 percent to $755 million. Intermodal revenues improved 4 percent to $563 million.
Railway operating expenses for the second quarter fell 3 percent to $1.9 billion, compared with 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
1.         MATERIALS AND OTHER 
             During the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million) of the claim.  As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery was no longer probable.
 
2.         INCOME TAXES
     During the second quarter of 2011, the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination of NS' 2008 tax return and review of certain claims for refund for prior years that resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $40 million.  Also during the second quarter of 2011, three states enacted tax law changes that decreased deferred income tax expense by $19 million.
 
3.         EARNINGS PER SHARE
     For basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the second quarter, $2 million in 2012 and 2011; and for the first six months, $4 million for 2012 and 2011.       
     For diluted earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the second quarter, less than $1 million in 2012 and 2011; and for the first six months, $2 million for 2012 and 2011.
 
4.         STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     NS repurchased and retired 12.3 million shares of Common Stock in the first six months of 2012, at a cost of $850 million, and 11.6 million shares at a cost of $792 million for the same period of 2011.  The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.  Since the beginning of 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 121.9 million shares at a total cost of $7.1 billion.
