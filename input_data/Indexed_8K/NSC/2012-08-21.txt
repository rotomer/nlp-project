Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant
 
On August 20, 2012, the Registrant issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.903% Notes due 2023 (the New Notes) in exchange for specified series of the Registrants outstanding debt securities, in connection with the expiration of the early exchange date for its previously announced exchange offers.
 
The New Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 20, 2012 (the Indenture), between the Registrant and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as trustee (the Trustee). The New Notes will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 2.903% per annum and will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the Registrants option.  If the New Notes are redeemed prior to the date that is three months prior to the maturity date for the New Notes, the redemption price for the New Notes to be redeemed will equal the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the New Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a specified rate, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the redemption date.  If the New Notes are redeemed on or after the date that is three months prior to the maturity date for the New Notes, the redemption price for the New Notes to be redeemed will equal 100% of the principal amount of such New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  The Indenture is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and the description of the Indenture contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
 
On August 20, 2012, in connection with the issuance of the New Notes, the Registrant entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with the dealer managers (the Dealer Managers).  Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 180 days after the final settlement date of the exchange offers, and use commercially reasonable efforts to have declared effective within 270 days from such final settlement date, an exchange offer registration statement pursuant to which the Registrant will issue, in exchange for tendered New Notes, registered securities containing terms identical to the New Notes in all material respects.  The Registration Rights Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
 
The Trustee and its affiliates, as well the Dealer Managers and their respective affiliates, have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, commercial banking and investment banking services for the Registrant, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses and none of which are material individually or in the aggregate with respect to any individual party.

This report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers Certificate from the Company stating that such redemption will comply with the provisions of this Indenture and of the Securities.

17
 
Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities.  The Trustee shall make the selection from Outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  For purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to redemption of the Securities shall relate, in the case of any of the Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount thereof which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
SECTION 3.03.  
Notice of Redemption

(5)
 
that, unless the Company defaults in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the Holders is to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities redeemed; and
(6)

Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
 
SECTION 3.05.  
Deposit of Redemption Price
.  By 10:00 a.m., New York City time on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 2.05) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date), on all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption on that date which have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation.
 
If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless the Company defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment, and the Holders shall have no further rights with respect to such Securities except for the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Securities. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal, premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, accrued interest thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate provided in the Securities.
SECTION 3.06.  
Securities Redeemed in Part

Unless otherwise designated by the Company by written notice to the Trustee, such office or agency shall be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
 
(b)        The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Place of Payment for such purposes.

(b)        Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
(c)        The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

SECTION 9.02.  
With Consent of Holders

The aggregate amount of losses,
 
 
18
 
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls a Dealer Manager, Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Dealer Manager, Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or Underwriter and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
