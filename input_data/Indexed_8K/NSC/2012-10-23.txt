ailway operating revenues totaled $2.7 billion, down 7 percent compared with third-quarter 2011, primarily
as the result of volume declines in coal and merchandise and lower revenues from fuel surcharges. Third-quarter 2012 fuel surcharge revenues were impacted by a $21 million unfavorable lag effect, while third-quarter 2011 fuel surcharge revenues included a favorable lag effect of $52 million.
General merchandise revenues were $1.4 billion, 1 percent lower than third-quarter 2011 results. Coal revenues fell 22 percent, to $701 million, compared with the same period last year. Intermodal revenues were $567 million, 3 percent higher compared with the third quarter of 2011.
            Railway operating expenses for the third quarter increased 1 percent to $2.0 billion, compared with 2011.
            Income from railway operations was $731 million, 22 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
            The third-quarter railway operating ratio increased to 72.9 percent compared with 67.5 percent during the third quarter of 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
 
1.
                 
MATERIALS AND OTHER 
During the first quarter of 2011, NS received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and was denied recovery of the contested portion ($43 million) of the claim.  As a result, NS recorded a $43 million charge during the first quarter of 2011 for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery was no longer probable. 
 
2.
                
INCOME TAXES
During the second quarter of 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of NS' 2008 tax return and review of certain claims for refund for prior years that resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $40 million.  Also during the second quarter of 2011, three states enacted tax law changes that decreased deferred income tax expense by $19 million. 
 
3.
                 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
For basic earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the third quarter, $3 million in 2012 and $2 million in 2011; and for the first nine months, $7 million in 2012 and $6 million in 2011.       
For diluted earnings per share, income available to common stockholders reflects reductions for the effect of dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and restricted stock units as follows:  for the third quarter, $1 million in 2012 and less than $1 million in 2011; and for the first nine months, $3 million in 2012 and $2 million in 2011.
 
4.
                 
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
NS repurchased and retired 16.5 million shares of Common Stock in the first nine months of 2012, at a cost of $1.2 billion, and 23.8 million shares at a cost of $1.6 billion for the same period of 2011.  On August 1, 2012, NS Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of Common Stock through December 31, 2017.  The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term share repurchases are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.  Since the beginning of 2006, NS has repurchased and retired 126.1 million shares at a total cost of $7.4 billion.
