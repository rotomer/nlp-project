Quarterly Highlights In the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, Network Appliance continued to enhance its enterprise solutions, broaden its customer portfolio, expand its partnerships with other industry leaders, and gain market acceptance for its unified storage, iSCSI, NearStore(TM) and NetCache(R) solutions. The company reinforced its commitment to interoperable management solutions by releasing the Manage ONTAP(TM) API Suite and Software Developers' Kit, which provides developers open access to Network Appliance(TM) application programming interfaces, enabling partners to more tightly integrate and synergize their management applications for optimal performance in NetApp(R) environments. During the first quarter, customers from a variety of industries worldwide selected Network Appliance to store, manage and consolidate their business- and mission-critical data. Network Appliance enterprise storage and service wins include Ball State University; Continental Airlines; Siemens Business Services; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP; Ticketmaster; and Visa Debit Processing Services. NearStore customer wins included EDS; Ford Motor Europe; and Jefferson Pilot Financial. Network Appliance also expanded its channel strategy by signing distribution agreements with the North American Computer Products group of Arrow Electronics and Avnet Hall-Mark. The agreements enable new Network Appliance distributors to provide value-added resellers the tools, training, marketing, sales, and technical services to build and expand their storage businesses and open up greater market penetration opportunities for Network Appliance. Network Appliance extended its strategic alliances with Oracle Corporation and Fujitsu Siemens Computers to offer low-cost, scalable, integrated server and storage platform solutions optimized for Oracle9i Database with Oracle9i Real Application Clusters (RAC) for Linux(R). Network Appliance, Oracle, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers also opened Europe's first Enterprise Technology Center dedicated to assisting users with implementing enterprise solutions. More than 500 customers have downloaded NetApp iSCSI protocols to test in their enterprise environments, and Network Appliance continues to take a leadership position in iSCSI. In addition, IBM announced support of Network Appliance's iSCSI solutions in IBM DB2 Universal Database environments, helping customers leverage the benefits of a simple and more affordable storage area network infrastructure. In other partner-related news, Network Appliance extended its partnership with McDATA Corporation to deliver optimized networked storage solutions for companies of all sizes. NetApp also expanded its leadership efforts in Linux technology by partnering with Red Hat and SuSE Linux to develop enterprise storage solutions on Linux technology.
