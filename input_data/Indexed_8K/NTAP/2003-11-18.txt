"I am very pleased with our results and our continued growth, which exceeded 25% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter," said Dan Warmenhoven, Chief Executive Officer at Network Appliance. "Our entry-level FAS systems achieved significant market momentum, and we continue to lead in enterprise iSCSI storage systems. We have expanded SnapLock(TM) for general enterprise as well as regulatory compliance needs. Most importantly, our growth reflects our strong customer commitment, growing services expertise, and sales emphasis on enterprise accounts." Quarterly Highlights In the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, Network Appliance continued to reinforce its position as a storage leader by expanding its iSCSI, unified storage, and NearStore(R) solutions, extending its partnerships with other technology leaders, and winning customers across all target industries. The company reaffirmed its commitment to iSCSI technology by becoming the first to support Windows(R), Novell(R), NetWare(R), and Linux(R) native iSCSI initiators on Intel(R) technology-based platforms, enabling customers to share and network more of their data currently in direct-attached configurations using their existing network infrastructures. In addition, Network Appliance announced its program to qualify iSCSI adapter vendors as NetApp(R) supported solutions in conjunction with NetApp iSCSI storage systems, allowing vendors to develop affordable, certified, and interoperable storage consolidation solutions. During the second quarter, customers worldwide also chose Network Appliance to store, manage, protect, and consolidate a wide range of data. Unified storage, iSCSI, SAN, and NAS wins included 1-800 CONTACTS, Antwerp Municipal Port Authority, Bacardi, Bronson Healthcare, DHL International, Egmont IT, National Instruments, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, TF1, U.S. Department of State, and Xerox Corporation. NearStore customer wins included Constellation Energy Group, Discovery Communications, Inc., L'Equipe, Magellan Health, and The College Board. The company also expanded its data protection and regulatory compliance initiatives by extending the SnapLock solutions for regulated data and data permanence storage. Network Appliance introduced SnapLock Compliance, which meets the storage safeguards required by SEC Rule 17a-3 and 17a-4. Network Appliance also released SnapLock Enterprise, which provides customers with the assurance that important data and business records remain accurate, safe, accessible, and unmodified. In addition, Network Appliance teamed up with Decru DataFort(TM) and MDY Advanced Technologies to achieve U.S. Department of Defense 5015.2-STD certification for electronic records management applications, enabling defense users to meet stringent data protection and shredding regulations regarding national security. During the quarter, Network Appliance reinforced its commitment to partners by launching the NetApp Partner Program to support the companies who continue to play an integral role in developing and expanding Network Appliance's enterprise solutions and services. The program enables partners to more tightly integrate and synergize their products and services for optimal performance in NetApp environments by providing the tools, training, collateral, education programs, and online partner and support portals to assist them in addressing the end user needs. The company also extended its strategic partnership with Fujitsu Siemens Computers to deliver integrated server and storage solutions for Oracle database technology to European customers. In addition, Network Appliance signed an agreement with VERITAS Software Corporation expanding their strategic partnership to cooperatively develop and deliver integrated solutions for customers through joint sales and marketing and cooperative technical support.

Pro forma results exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock compensation, restructuring charges, net gain or loss on investments, gain on sale of intangible assets, and the related effects on income taxes, as well as the benefit of a non-recurring foreign tax ruling. Acquisition Highlights On November 4, 2003, Network Appliance signed a merger agreement with Spinnaker Networks, Inc., a privately held company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for approximately $300 million in an all-stock transaction. The software technology acquisition reaffirms the Network Appliance business model and accelerates the company's vision for a storage grid future, enabling customers to leverage more value from their storage and data infrastructures.
