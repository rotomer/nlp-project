Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2005; Q1 Revenue Up 38% Year over Year; Eleventh Consecutive Quarter of Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2004--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $358.4 million, an increase of 38% compared to revenues of $260.5 million for the same period a year ago and a 6% increase compared to $337.0 million in the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 73% to $46.9 million, or $0.13 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $27.1 million, or $0.08 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma(2) net income for the first fiscal quarter increased 73% to $49.9 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $28.7 million, or $0.08 per share for the same period a year ago. "NetApp demonstrated exceptional execution, a strong balance sheet, and continued cash generation during the quarter. We continue to drive our solutions deeper into our customers' data centers and mission-critical areas to solve significant issues around business continuity, regulatory compliance, and high data availability," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Our focus is on expanding our market share and our results demonstrate that the market is continuing to move toward us." Quarterly Highlights Throughout the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position by deploying new tier-one storage solutions, expanding partnerships, and enhancing its storage grid architecture. Customers deploying NetApp during the quarter for a variety of database, collaborative, and other data center and mission-critical applications included Audi AG, Canon, Catholic Healthcare West, China Everbright Bank, Ciena, City of Concord, ConocoPhillips, Fujitsu LTD, Gap Inc., GE Healthcare, Hearst Corporation, ING BHF Bank, Pixar, Progress Energy, Qualcomm, Sprint, Telstra, and University of Georgia. All levels of enterprise customers have chosen to deploy NetApp for a variety of reasons -- reduced complexity, a low total cost of ownership (TCO), and advanced management capabilities made possible through Data ONTAP(TM) and a range of additional storage software packages that unleash the value of enterprise data. On the partners front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with McData, Ontrack Data Recovery, Oracle, Secure Computing, Symantec, Trend Micro, and VERITAS to address a variety of data concerns, including e-mail recovery, unified storage, and security issues facing enterprise customers. For storage grid architectures, the company continued to set the pace for the rest of the industry in iSCSI and IP SAN (storage area network), with more than 700 real-world production deployments to date, and reinforced its leadership in other storage application areas such as data protection/recovery, disk-based nearline storage, and database storage. In database storage in particular, NetApp demonstrated its prowess with large Oracle(R) deployments at Universal Tax Systems and the South China Morning Post and received a prestigious SAP Pinnacle Award for innovation around storage for SAP environments. Finally, Network Appliance also debuted its new midrange unified storage models, the FAS920 and FAS920c. Designed to provide affordable enterprise-class performance, reliability and advanced data management features for midrange applications, the FAS920 can power applications in Fibre Channel and iSCSI SANs and network-attached storage (NAS) simultaneously. In corporate news, Network Appliance recently announced that it is the recipient of a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) from the governor of North Carolina to assist in any expansion of newly acquired NetApp offices in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. NetApp also added two new members to its board of directors: Mark Leslie and George Shaheen.

Network Appliance Usage of Pro Forma Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
