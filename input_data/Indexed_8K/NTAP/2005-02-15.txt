Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2005; Generates a Record $148.5 Million in Cash from Operations SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 15, 2005--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the third fiscal quarter were $412.7 million, an increase of 39% compared to revenues of $297.3 million for the same period a year ago and a 10% increase compared to $375.2 million in the prior quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 50% to $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $40.2 million, or $0.11 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma(2) net income for the third fiscal quarter increased 57% to $62.8 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $40.1 million, or $0.11 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.1 billion, compared to revenues of $833.3 million for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 38% year over year. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 40% to $162.3 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $115.6 million, or $0.32 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma net income for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $171.1 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $102.4 million, or $0.28 per share for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. "This quarter's strong, well-rounded results demonstrate that our investments in sales, services and innovation are paying off, both in product and services revenue growth," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Customers' increasing need for data protection, including compliance, disk-to-disk backup, and business continuity solutions, is one of the key drivers of our growth this quarter. In addition, we expect our leadership in emerging technologies such as iSCSI, virtualization, and the storage grid to increasingly contribute to our growth over the long term." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that revenue for the fourth quarter will grow sequentially by 6% to 9%. This projection reflects year over year growth rates of 30% to 33%. -- The company expects fourth quarter pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.16 to $0.17 per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share are projected at $0.16 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish 35% to 36% higher than fiscal year 2004. -- Network Appliance estimates full year pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.60 to $0.62 per share. GAAP earnings per share are projected for fiscal year 2005 at $0.57 to $0.59 per share. Quarterly Highlights Throughout the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position by introducing the latest version of its powerful enterprise storage software, expanding partnerships, and continuing to demonstrate leadership in the iSCSI market. Customers deploying NetApp(R) solutions during the quarter for a variety of database, security, and other data center and mission-critical applications included AIRBUS France, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, The Dow Chemical Company, GlaxoSmithKline, IKON Digital Express, Mayo Clinic, Mentor Graphics Corporation, NASA, Philips Semiconductors, RadioShack Corporation, Synopsys, Inc., and Time Warner Cable. Network Appliance achieved a critical milestone in expanding and delivering its storage grid vision by shipping the latest version of its powerful enterprise storage software, Data ONTAP(TM) 7G, during the third quarter. Customers using Data ONTAP 7G and its advanced virtualization capabilities can double their storage utilization, dramatically increase I/O performance for enterprise-class applications, and significantly reduce storage management costs for multi-application environments. The two primary new features of Data ONTAP 7G that offer users compelling benefits are FlexVol(TM) and FlexClone(TM) software. FlexVol creates dynamically virtualized, flexible data containers that eliminate performance and utilization tradeoffs and renders obsolete the notion of storage volumes being statically tied to specific physical or logical disks. In short, FlexVol is the feature of Data ONTAP 7G that provides dynamic virtualization. FlexClone enables the near-instantaneous creation of multiple, independently writable images of FlexVol data sets, with zero storage overhead. Competitive approaches for cloning data take up the same amount of storage space as the full original data set. FlexClone represents a breakthrough innovation for database applications and modeling. Additionally, the NetApp enterprise gFiler(TM) storage systems will now provide Fibre Channel data access and fully leverage the new enterprise storage virtualization capabilities in Data ONTAP 7G for multi-vendor storage environments. The NetApp gFiler solution has extended its storage systems support to include the HP(R) StorageWorks XP Disk Array family and the IBM(R) TotalStorage DS4000 series (formerly named "FAStT"), complementing existing support for Hitachi Data Systems(R), Hitachi Limited(R), Sun(TM) StorEdge(R) 9900 Disk Array family, and IBM Enterprise Storage Server disk array systems. During the quarter, NetApp also introduced the next addition to its data management software portfolio with SnapValidator(TM). SnapValidator can now be applied across the full line of NetApp storage systems, across any protocol, supporting the Oracle(R) Databases, adding to a robust, highly reliable, and available data environment. In the iSCSI arena, NetApp continued to drive iSCSI adoption. According to IDC, NetApp maintained a strong lead in the iSCSI SAN storage market for the third quarter of calendar year 2004 (3Q04). In its core NAS market, NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in NAS hardware for 3Q04 in both revenue and terabytes shipped. Also according to IDC, the company posted a 36.3% revenue market share, with a 13.8% increase in revenue year over year (vs. the third quarter of calendar 2003). On the partner front, the company achieved Gold Certified status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in Advanced Infrastructure Solutions recognizing NetApp expertise and total impact in the technology marketplace. NetApp also unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Alacritus Software, Atempo, CommVault Systems, Inc., NetEx, QLogic Corporation, Red Hat Inc., Secure Computing Corporation, Sophos, and Syncsort, Inc. to address a variety of data concerns, including Internet access and security, virtual backup, data management, virus protection, data protection and recovery, iSCSI software for Linux environments and other business-critical initiatives facing enterprise customers. In corporate news, NetApp executives, products and the overall company were honored for a variety of achievements. Chief Executive Officer Dan Warmenhoven was honored with the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year(R) 2004 Award in the technology category for his outstanding vision, leadership, and achievement as CEO of Network Appliance. Cited for its "unrivaled" unified storage architecture and its "unmatched" flexibility, scalability, and continuity in the storage industry, the Network Appliance FAS270c was named "Best NAS Solution of the Year" in InfoWorld's 2005 Technology of the Year honors. NetApp was also honored by FORTUNE magazine as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the third consecutive year. This year, NetApp ranked at number 24, up from number 48 last year, reflecting the company's specific emphasis on attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and continuing to demonstrate the values of what NetApp CEO Dan Warmenhoven calls a "model company." The elite and prestigious FORTUNE listing is largely determined by employee feedback.
