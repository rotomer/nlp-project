(NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Revenues for the second fiscal quarter were $483.1 million, an increase of 29% compared to revenues of $375.2 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 8% compared to $448.4 million in the prior quarter. For the second fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $70.7 million, or $0.18 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $55.3 million, or $0.15 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the second fiscal quarter was $79.1 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $58.4 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $931.5 million, compared to revenues of $733.6 million for the first six months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 27% year over year. For the first six months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 28% to $130.8 million, or $0.34 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $102.2 million, or $0.27 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $141.3 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $108.2 million, or $0.29 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. "We achieved significant growth in revenue and profitability during the quarter driven by the compelling value proposition of our new FAS3000 midrange product line," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "NetApp provides customers with the best storage utilization rates in the industry, allowing them to decrease their total cost of ownership and increase their return on investment." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that year-over-year growth in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 will be in the range of 25% to 28%. -- The company expects third quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.17 and $0.18 per share. Network Appliance expects third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.21 per share. -- For the full fiscal year, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 26% to 28% higher than fiscal year 2005. -- The company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 to be between $0.70 and $0.73 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, Network Appliance solidified its leadership in data security with the completion of the Decru acquisition; demonstrated growth in iSCSI, NAS, and SAN; and expanded its operations in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. This quarter, NetApp maintained its position as market leader in iSCSI, grew its capacity market share lead in NAS, and grew the fastest among vendors tracked in the Fibre Channel (FC) SAN arena. According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q2 2005, NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in its core NAS market, with a 44.6% capacity share, up almost three (3) percentage points over Q1. NetApp also maintained its strong lead in the iSCSI storage market, with number-one share positions in capacity shipped (45.2%), revenue (41.6%), and units (36%). NetApp was also the fastest growing of the vendors tracked in iSCSI revenue, with a year-over-year growth rate of 120.9%. Finally, of the vendors tracked, NetApp posted the strongest year-over-year increase in FC SAN revenue, with a growth rate of 130.2%. Also according to IDC, NetApp experienced the fastest growth among the top five vendors in storage software with 49.4% year-over-year growth from Q2 2004 to Q2 2005 versus a market growth rate of 11.8% for the same period. Total NetApp market share in storage software grew from 5% in Q2 2004 to 6.6% in Q2 2005. Additional details are available in IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Storage Software Tracker Q2 2005. During the quarter, NetApp completed the acquisition of Decru, a privately held company based in Redwood City, California. The acquisition of Decru allows NetApp to offer the strongest security option in the industry. Decru is a clear market leader in storage security, helping enterprise and government customers address requirements including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure consolidation, and outsourcing. Decru DataFort(TM) appliances protect the core of the storage network by seamlessly inserting a layer of data encryption, authentication, key management, and compartmentalization. The first new products from Decru since the completion of the acquisition occurred during the quarter with the unveiling of next-generation storage security platforms. The new 10-port and SCSI models of Decru DataFort appliances, DataFort FC1020 and DataFort S115, deliver increased enterprise-class scalability native support for legacy tape environments, simplified management, and greater price/performance. Also this quarter, NetApp announced that it plans to join IBM as one of 10 founding members in a new open-source community, initially working under the project name Aperi, to give customers more choices for deploying open-standards-based storage infrastructure software. The organization plans to develop a common storage software management platform that will give customers greater flexibility in the way they manage their storage environments. Earlier this quarter, NetApp introduced NetApp(R) SnapManager(R) for Oracle(R) Database environments, which leverages the unique power of NetApp Snapshot(TM) technology and is a tightly integrated disk-based backup and granular recovery solution for Oracle customers using Oracle Automatic Storage Management technology. The solution provides customers with continuous uptime for online backups. NetApp SnapManager turns a multi-step backup and restore process into two simple commands from a single host machine. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Bus-Tech Inc., Cisco, NeoPath Networks, Network Intelligence, NuView, Oracle, SAP, and Symantec to address a variety of data concerns, including management and monitoring of enterprise grid environments, data replication, enterprise compliance, ILM management, data analysis, file storage management and utilization, mainframe tape replacement, storage virtualization, and consolidation of remote office/branch office (ROBO) data. Also this quarter, NetApp and Kazeon, a leading provider of information classification and management solutions for the enterprise, signed an OEM, development, and marketing agreement to integrate the intelligent data classification and search capabilities of Kazeon's Information Server with Network Appliance(TM) storage systems. Additionally, NetApp will resell Kazeon's Information Server as part of a jointly marketed solution. In corporate news, NetApp expanded to a new facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The company currently employs 360 employees in the Kit Creek Road facility and operates a 24x7 global service and support center in addition to a state-of-the-art data center with a capacity of multiple petabytes.
