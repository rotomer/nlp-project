For the third fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $76.4 million, or $0.20 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the third fiscal quarter increased 35% to $84.7 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $62.8 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.5 billion, compared to revenues of $1.1 billion for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 28% year over year. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 28% to $207.2 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $162.3 million, or $0.43 per share for the same period in the prior year.

"NetApp achieved significant growth in revenue and profitability during the quarter, driven in large part by the compelling value proposition of our new FAS3000 midrange product line," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "We provide customers with the best storage utilization rates in the industry, allowing them to decrease their total cost of ownership and increase their return on investment. Combining this with the performance and ease-of-use inherent in our full line of systems and data protection solutions, we are seeing increased uptake of NetApp in data centers around the globe." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that year-over-year growth in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 will be in the range of 28% to 30%. -- The company expects fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.20 and $0.21 per share. Network Appliance expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.23 per share. -- For the full fiscal year, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 28% to 29% higher than fiscal year 2005. -- The company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 to be between $0.73 and $0.74 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81 per share. Quarterly Highlights This quarter, NetApp(R) was listed in the "leader" quadrant for midrange enterprise disk arrays in Gartner's research note, "Magic Quadrant for Midrange Enterprise Disk Array, 2H05."(3) NetApp SAN solutions provide an unmatched combination of high-performance, robustness, and ease-of-use for Windows(R), Solaris(R), HP/UX, IBM AIX, and Linux(R) computing platforms. Also this quarter, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q3 2005(4), NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in the iSCSI storage market, with number-one market share in capacity shipped (38.4%) and revenue (35.1%). NetApp maintained leadership in its core NAS market, with a 44.3% capacity share. Of the vendors tracked, NetApp posted the strongest year-over-year increase in FC SAN revenue, with a growth rate of 118%. Also according to IDC, NetApp experienced the fastest growth among the top five vendors in storage software with 49.4% year-over-year growth from Q2 2004 to Q2 2005 versus a market growth rate of 11.8% for the same period. Total NetApp market share in storage software grew from 5% in Q2 2004 to 6.6% in Q2 2005. Earlier in the quarter, NetApp unveiled its Uncompromised Security Initiative, a visionary program that challenges the status quo of data security and promises to deliver industry-best solutions to the enterprise. NetApp has numerous product lines shipping today that enable it to deliver uncompromised security, including Decru(R) DataFort(TM) storage security appliances, NetApp disk systems running Data ONTAP(R) security features, and NetCache(R) internet access and security appliances, as well as strong partnerships with leading vendors such as Symantec that enhance the security portfolio. The NetApp Uncompromised Security Initiative provides a vision and a roadmap for customers who expect best-in-class data management, coupled with military-grade security. In other product news, Network Appliance announced the NetCache C1300 system, the first enterprise Web security appliance delivering unmatched value for highly distributed environments and another component in the NetApp Uncompromised Security portfolio. Furthering the relationship with NetApp, this quarter IBM announced the introduction of the IBM(R) System Storage(TM) N5000, a new series of networked storage systems designed to help midrange customers dramatically reduce their total cost of ownership, particularly enterprises operating distributed networks across remote sites. The N5000 series represents the second major technology offering resulting from IBM's relationship with NetApp announced in April 2005. During the quarter, the FAS3020c was named "Best NAS Solution of the Year" in InfoWorld's 2006 Technology of the Year honors. This marked the second consecutive year that NetApp won Best NAS from InfoWorld. In 2005, the NetApp FAS200 series also received the award. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Acopia Networks, Cisco, Microsoft and Network Intelligence to address a variety of data concerns, including backup and recovery, file virtualization, data migration, log management lifecycles, storage management and consolidation. In corporate news, NetApp was named by FORTUNE magazine as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the fourth consecutive year. This year, NetApp again ranked in the top half of the list, at number 27, reflecting the company's emphasis on attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and continuing to demonstrate the values of what NetApp CEO Dan Warmenhoven calls a "model company." Internationally, NetApp established a regional headquarters in Hong Kong as part of the company's continuing worldwide expansion and growth. The NetApp Hong Kong office will offer regional headquarters' functions to NetApp offices, distribution, channel and systems integrator partners in Asia Pacific, including Australia, Greater China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Southeast Asia. NetApp celebrated 10 years as a publicly traded company on November 21, 2005. Tom Mendoza, president of NetApp, rang the opening bell at NASDAQ in New York, along with Dan Warmenhoven, CEO and David Hitz and James Lau, both founders and executive vice presidents.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include general economic and industry conditions, including expenditure trends for storage-related products; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings, competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our relationships with strategic partners; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in Network Appliance, Inc.'s reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections captioned "risk factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. (1) Earnings per share represent the diluted number of shares for all periods presented. (2) Non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, in process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments and the related effects on income taxes, as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. (3) Magic Quadrant for Midrange Enterprise Disk Array, 2H05 (4) IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q3 2005 NetApp, Data ONTAP, Decru and NetCache are registered trademarks and Network Appliance and DataFort are trademarks of Network Appliance Inc. in the United States and other countries.

All other trademarks belong to their respective owners and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials. The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments and the related effects on income taxes, as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items because they derive from unusual events that are not attributable to normal on-going operations and thus makes it more difficult for an investor to understand our recurring operational performance. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
