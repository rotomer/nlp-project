Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Company") approved an increase in the annual base salary for Thomas F. Mendoza, the Companys President, and Robert E. Salmon, the Companys Executive Vice President, Field Operations. Effective January 29, 2007, Mr. Mendozas annual base salary will increase from $425,000 to $535,000, and Mr. Salmons annual base salary will increase from $400,000 to $450,000. The increase in annual base salary for the two executives was based on a recent review of the compensation for the following senior management positions by a compensation consultant engaged by the Committee: President, Executive Vice President of Field Operations and Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Based on the results of the consultants analysis, the Committee concluded that the current base salary and incentive compensation for Messrs. Mendoza and Salmon wer e below market (based on a review of peer companies) and below the Companys own compensation target range. In addition, based in part on the analysis of the consultant, the Committee approved an increase in the fiscal year 2007 target incentive compensation for Mr. Mendoza from 80% to 85% of his revised 2007 base salary and, for Mr. Salmon, from 60% to 80% of his revised 2007 base salary, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FY 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2007 Plan"), which the Committee adopted and approved earlier in fiscal 2007. The terms and conditions of the 2007 Plan are similar in all material respects to those set forth in the FY 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, filed as an exhibit to the Companys Form 8-K, filed on May 18, 2005. Accordingly, under the 2007 Plan, Messrs. Mendoza and Salmon (as well as the Companys other eligible executive officers) are eligible to receive annual performance-based cash compensation based on such individuals&# x2019; assigned target incentive compensation levels (expressed as a percentage of annual base salary) and the funding of the 2007 Plan, the funding of which will be determined based on the Companys operating profits for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2007.
