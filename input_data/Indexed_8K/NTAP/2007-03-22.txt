Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Share Repurchase: As previously announced on November 15, 2006, Network Appliance, Inc.s (the "Registrant") Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of shares of its outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. Pursuant to that authorization, on March 19, 2007, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation (the "Agreement") and a Pricing Supplement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc ("JP Morgan") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variable number of shares of its common stock from JP Morgan for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million pursuant t o a private capped accelerated share repurchase program. The final per share purchase price and the number of shares to be repurchased will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on JP Morgan's initial hedge price. In addition, the registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on March 22, 2007. At the end of the specified period, the Registrant may receive additional shares should the VWAP for the period be below the cap price. Under a similar Master Agreement with J. P. Morgan, the Registrant repurchased 6.2 million shares of the Registrants common stock for $241.8 million during the three-months period ended January 26, 2007. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Regi strant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of repurchased shares when delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circumstances under which JP Morgan is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and JP Morgan to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.
