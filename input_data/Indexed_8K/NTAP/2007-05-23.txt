Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 Q4 Revenues $801.2 Million, up 34% Year over Year; Fiscal Year 2007 Revenues $2.8 Billion, up 36% Year over Year SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 23, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter were $801.2 million, an increase of 34% compared to revenues of $598.0 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 10% compared to $729.3 million in the prior quarter. For the fourth fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 51% to $89.6 million, or $0.23 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $59.2 million, or $0.15 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the fourth fiscal quarter increased 28% to $114.2 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $89.3 million, or $0.23 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for fiscal year 2007 totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 36% compared to revenues of $2.07 billion for fiscal year 2006. For fiscal year 2007, GAAP net income increased 12% to $297.7 million, or $0.77 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $266.5 million, or $0.69 per share for fiscal year 2006. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2007 increased 37% to $430.7 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $315.3 million, or $0.81 per share for fiscal year 2006. "Network Appliance had a great finish to a great year. With 36% annual growth, NetApp clearly provides to customers the best value in the industry," said Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive officer. "And while we weren't immune from the March macroeconomic spending slowdown, our competitive differentiation and business fundamentals have never been stronger." Outlook -- Network Appliance expects sequential revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 to decline by 6% to 7%, which translates to about 20% to 21% growth year over year. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company estimates that the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. Network Appliance expects first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.24 to $0.25 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, NetApp broadened its Fibre Channel (FC) storage area network (SAN) portfolio and enhanced data management and data protection solutions with new products as well as broader and deeper partnerships. The company also continued to gain momentum in the SAN market while maintaining market leadership in both network-attached storage (NAS) and iSCSI. Continuing its extension into the data center, NetApp announced two new midrange platforms aimed at making enterprise data center management easier for customers. The NetApp(R) FAS3040 and NetApp V3040 series created additional market opportunities for NetApp as it broadened its enterprise lineup and added functionality for FC SAN environments. The NetApp FC SAN portfolio was further strengthened with the worldwide availability of new switches, including two new blades for the Brocade(R) 48000 Director, and the QLogic(R) SANbox(R) 9000 Core and SANbox 5600 Stackable Series of switches. NetApp expanded its enterprise-class software line with NetApp ReplicatorX(TM) and NetApp SnapManager(R) software for use with SAP(R) solutions. NetApp ReplicatorX (formerly Topio TDPS) provides continuous data replication and recovery across a range of locations and storage systems, including EMC, HDS, HP, IBM, and NetApp. NetApp SnapManager software for use with SAP enhances application availability and provides increased storage management flexibility in SAP environments. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q4 2006(3), NetApp continued to grow faster than the market in FC SAN in both revenue and capacity, year over year. The company grew FC SAN revenue at more than seven times the rate of both the market leader and the overall FC SAN market, and grew FC SAN capacity at more than four times the rate of the overall market. In addition to FC SAN, NetApp continued to demonstrate leadership in the NAS and iSCSI storage markets, maintaining the number-one market share position in capacity shipped for NAS (38.9%) and in iSCSI for both capacity and revenue. NetApp also continued to show significant gains in storage software, growing six times faster than the overall storage software market from 2005 to 2006, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Storage Software Tracker Q4 2006(4). NetApp leadership in innovation remained strong with the news that it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc., in the "Visionaries" quadrant in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Storage Resource Management (SRM) and SAN Management Software, 2007(5). On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Brocade, Cisco, Fujitsu, Onaro, RSA, SAP, Symantec, and VMware to address a variety of data concerns, including data management, data protection, and data replication. In corporate news, NetApp topped the "Most Admired Company" list in the computer peripherals industry in FORTUNE Magazine's 2007 "America's Most Admired Companies" rankings. NetApp StoreVault(TM) S500 also received accolades in the fourth quarter as it was voted "Best Product of the Year" in Small Business Computing's 2007 Product Excellence Awards.

All other brands or products are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, other acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges/recoveries, gain/loss on sales of assets and investments, certain other nonrecurring events, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
