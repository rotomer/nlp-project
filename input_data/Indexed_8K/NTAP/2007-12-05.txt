Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 29, 2007, Network Appliance Inc. ("the Company") entered into a $90.4 million financing and operating leasing arrangement with BNP Paribas LLC ("BNP") for approximately 331,650 square feet of buildings located in Sunnyvale, California. Under the terms of the transaction documents, the Company has agreed to lease the buildings from BNP for a term expiring in December 2012. The lease can be renewed for up to two consecutive periods of 5 years each upon approval by BNP and satisfaction of the other conditions to extension set forth in the transaction documents. This lease arrangement requires the Company ("the Lessee") to pay minimum lease payments ("base rent") beginning on January 2, 2008, which may vary based on a floating effective rate. The base rent may be, at the Companys option, based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread or Alternative Base Rate ("ABR"). For rent period subject to a LIBOR election, the base rent will be based on the LIBOR rate for the int erest period specified by the Company plus a spread based on the Companys leverage ratio. For base rent period that is subject to an ABR election, the effective rate will be based on the Prime Rate for such period. In addition, the Company must pay certain fees (including, arrangement, upfront fees and an annual administrative agency fees.) Upon the expiration of the term (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, the Company must elect one of the following options: (i) the Company may purchase the buildings for $90.4 million, generally, the Break-Even Price, (ii) if certain conditions are met, the Company may arrange for the sale of the buildings to a third party provided that the Company pays any deficiency between the sales proceeds and the Break Even Amount, up to a maximum $76.9 million, or (iii) the Company makes a supplemental payment to BNP equal to $76.9 million, in which event, the Company will have the opportunity to recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale of the buildings during the ensuing 2 year period. In connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to maintain specified financial covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio and a Minimum Liquidity. The foregoing description of the agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrants Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for period ending January 25, 2008.
