Under the terms of the transaction documents, the Company has agreed to lease its land to BNP for a period of 99 years, as the construction manager for BNP, to complete construction of the office building by approximately January 2010, and to lease the completed building from BNP for a term expiring in February 2015. The lease can be renewed for up to two consecutive periods of five years each upon approval by BNP and satisfaction of the other conditions to extension set forth in the transaction documents. This lease arrangement requires the Company ("the Lessee") to pay minimum lease payments after completion of construction which vary based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread. In additi on, the Company must pay certain fees (including, commitment and administrative agency fees), and, following completion of construction, all of the taxes, insurance, ground lease rent, maintenance, and repair costs with respect to the project. Upon the expiration of the term (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, the Company must elect one of the following options: (i) the Company may purchase the building for $48,950,000, generally, the Break-Even Price, (ii) if certain conditions are met, the Company may arrange for the sale of the building to a third party provided that the Company pays any deficiency between the sales proceeds and the Break Even Amount, up to a maximum $41,607,500, or (iii) the Company makes a supplemental payment to BNP equal to $41,607,500, in which event, the Company will have the opportunity to recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale of the building during the ensuing 2 year period. In connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to maintain specified financial covenants which include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and a Minimum Liquidity (the sum of all unrestricted cash and unrestricted cash investments as reported in the Companys 10-K and 10-Q filings.) The foregoing description of the agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for period ending April 25, 2008.
