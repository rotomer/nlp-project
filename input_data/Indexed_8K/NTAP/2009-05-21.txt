The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of Data Domain by NetApp by means of a merger involving one or both of the Merger Subs. As a result of the Merger, Data Domain would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of NetApp. The parties anticipate that the deal will close in 60-120 days subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.

Merger Agreement
Effect of Merger on Data Domain Common Stock, Stock Options, RSUs and Restricted Stock
Upon the closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of Data Domain common stock (other than those shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be converted into the right to receive (a) $11.45 per share in cash, without interest (the per share amount of cash being referred to as the ""), plus (b) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of NetApp common stock equal to the following exchange ratio (the ""):
Cash Consideration
Exchange Ratio
          (i) 0.833 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average (as defined below) is less than $16.26,
          (ii) 0.682 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average is greater than $19.88, and
          (iii) that fraction of a share of NetApp common stock (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $13.55 by the Closing Average, if the Closing Average is (A) less than or equal to $19.88 and (B) greater than or equal to $16.26 (the per share amount of stock referenced in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, as applicable, being referred to as the "").
Stock Consideration
The "" is defined as the average of the closing sales prices for NetApp common stock, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, on NASDAQ for the ten most recent consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.
Closing Average
In the event that the Exchange Ratio is greater than or equal to 0.750 and less than 0.833, NetApp, in its sole discretion, may (a) reduce the Stock Consideration by such amount as NetApp may determine and (b) increase the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of the such reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Closing Average. However, NetApp may not reduce the amount of the Stock Consideration and increase the Cash Consideration to the extent that it would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, except as may be required as described in the paragraph below. The parties can make no assurances as to the tax-free status of the transaction.
If the aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration issuable in the Merger (including Stock Consideration issuable to holders of Data Domain options, restricted stock and restricted shares) would exceed 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the Stock Consideration will be decreased to the minimum extent necessary so that no more than 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock will be issued in the Merger (with such percentage measured immediately prior to the closing of the Merger). In such event, the Cash Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the product of (a) the amount of the reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (b) the Closing Average.
Each of Data Domain's options to purchase common stock of Data Domain outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be assumed by NetApp, and, at the closing of the Merger, be converted into the right to receive NetApp stock options, based on an exchange ratio specified in the Merger Agreement.
Table of Contents
Each of Data Domain's restricted shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration, subject to any forfeiture provisions applicable to such securities. Each of Data Domain's restricted stock units outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration based on a formula specified in the Merger Agreement, subject to any vesting provisions applicable to such securities.
Representations, Warranties & Covenants
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of NetApp, Data Domain, Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two, including, among others, covenants by Data Domain to:
Conditions to Closing of the Merger
The closing of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others:
Termination of the Merger Agreement
Under certain circumstances in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, Data Domain is required to pay NetApp a break-up fee amount equal to $57,000,000 in immediately available funds.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Data Domain, NetApp, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Data Domain's or NetApp's public disclosures.
Voting Agreements
In connection with the parties' entry into the Merger Agreement, the directors and executive officers of Data Domain and their affiliates have entered into voting agreements pursuant to which they have agreed to, among other things, vote their shares of Data Domain common stock in favor of the Merger. Stockholders of Data Domain holding approximately 22.0% of the outstanding capital stock of Data Domain have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. The parties to the Voting Agreements have agreed to comply with certain restrictions on the disposition of such shares, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein. Pursuant to their terms, such voting agreements

will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the approval of the Merger by Data Domain's stockholders and any termination of the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION
     NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP) announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement under which NetApp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Data Domain common stock for $25 per share in cash and stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1.5B, net of Data Domain's cash.
Sunnyvale, Calif. and Santa Clara, Calif.  May 20, 2009
     "This combination is a great opportunity for both NetApp and Data Domain," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO of NetApp. "Data Domain is an innovative high-growth company with a complementary product line ideally suited for multi-vendor environments where customers want to minimize their use of tape for backup. NetApp has the distribution channels and international reach to offer Data Domain products to more customers, accelerating growth and market adoption. The combination of our two companies will increase NetApp's reputation for delivering both outstanding efficiency and operational breakthroughs to customers worldwide."
     Customers will benefit from the robust worldwide sales, support, partner, and service network NetApp can bring to Data Domain products, further enabling customers to deploy Data Domain products on a global basis. NetApp and Data Domain channel partners will benefit from the inclusion of the innovative Data Domain product line into the NetApp Partner Program.
     NetApp intends to operate Data Domain as a product line within NetApp's product operations organization. The Data Domain sales organization will be integrated with NetApp sales to maximize momentum and access new accounts.
 
     "Our objective will be to amplify Data Domain's success, grow Data Domain's revenues as quickly as today's economy will allow, and create systems and incentives within NetApp to nurture Data Domain to its fullest potential," added Warmenhoven. "We will focus on new customer acquisition and maximum market share expansion. Their existing customers should see the benefits of NetApp's broader scale and support capabilities."
     "Notwithstanding the rapid record sales growth Data Domain has experienced over the past 5 years, with NetApp's distribution channel and customer base, we have an opportunity to accelerate even further," said Frank Slootman, president and CEO of Data Domain.
Portfolio Synergy
     The Data Domain portfolio brings a complementary offering to NetApp, expanding NetApp's reach in the market for heterogeneous disk-based backup. Today, NetApp's heterogeneous backup offering (with its VTL product line) provides installations with disk-based solutions to augment their tape backup infrastructure. Data Domain's portfolio will extend NetApp's ability to compete in the increasing number of installations wanting to minimize their reliance on tape. The Data Domain acquisition increases NetApp's ability to capitalize on the growth of disk-based backup adoption, a trend accelerated by the economics of deduplication.
Transaction Details
     The Board of Directors of Data Domain has unanimously approved the transaction. We anticipate that the deal will close in 60-120 days subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval.
     More details on this transaction will be available on NetApp's quarterly results conference call which will be broadcast live on the Internet at on Wednesday, May 20, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The conference call will also be
