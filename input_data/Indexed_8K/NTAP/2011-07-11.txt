After market close on July 8, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Contract") with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), under which the Company will repurchase approximately $200,000,000 of its shares of common stock, the final number of shares subject to adjustment described below.

Shares will be delivered to the Company over the term of the ASR Contract, which is expected to end no later than November 25, 2011. The exact number of shares to be repurchased generally will be determined by the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of shares traded during the term of the agreement, subject to collar provisions that will establish minimum and maximum numbers of shares to be repurchased.
The ASR Contract contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares that will be delivered, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the circumstances under which Bank of America is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Company and Bank of America to one another.
