On December 12, 2012, NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp") entered into an indenture (the "Base Indenture") and a first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and referred to together with the Base Indenture as the "Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, to establish the terms and form of those certain senior unsecured notes issued by NetApp in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes consist of the following tranches: $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2013.
NetApp previously entered into an Underwriting Agreement dated December 5, 2012 in connection with the sale of the Notes, as described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by NetApp with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 5, 2012. The Notes were offered and sold under NetApp's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-185217) filed with the SEC on November 30, 2012.
NetApp intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of certain indebtedness, capital expenditures, possible stock repurchases, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. NetApp may also be required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change in control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, and it may elect to redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time, as further specified in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains limited affirmative and negative covenants of NetApp. The negative covenants restrict the ability of NetApp and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens on its principal property or on shares of stock or indebtedness of its subsidiaries that own principal property; to engage in sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any principal property; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.
Events of default under the Indenture include a failure to make payments, non-performance of affirmative and negative covenants, and the occurrence of bankruptcy and insolvency-related events. NetApp's obligations may be accelerated upon an event of default, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would become immediately due and payable.
The foregoing description of certain terms of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, which are filed with this report as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

If any such exchange or transfer from a Definitive Security of a series to a beneficial interest is effected pursuant to subparagraphs (2) or (3) of this Section 2.05(f) at a time when an Unrestricted Global Security of such series has not yet been issued, the Company shall issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.04, the Trustee shall authenticate one or more Unrestricted Global Securities of such series in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of Definitive Securities of such series so transferred.

Restricted Definitive Securities to Restricted Definitive Securities
(2) . Any Restricted Definitive Security of a series may be exchanged by the Holder thereof for an Unrestricted Definitive Security of such series or transferred to a Person or Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Definitive Security of such series if the Security Registrar receives a completed certificate from such Holder in the form of Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable and an opinion of counsel in form, and from legal counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Company to the effect that such exchange or transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act and that the restrictions on transfer contained herein and in the Private Placement Legend are no longer required in order to maintain compliance with the Securities Act.
Restricted Definitive Securities to Unrestricted Definitive Securities
 
(3) . A Holder of Unrestricted Definitive Securities of a series may transfer such Securities to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Definitive Security of such series in accordance with subsection 2.05(a).

At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security of such series is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security of such series or for Definitive Securities of such series, the principal amount of Securities of such series represented by such Global Security shall be reduced accordingly and an endorsement may be made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Security of such series, such other Global Security shall be increased accordingly and an endorsement may be made on such Global Security by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase.
Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Securities

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 30 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the Outstanding Securities of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption, nor (iii) to register the transfer of or exchange a Security of any series between the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(5) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

Section 2.06 .
Temporary Securities
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten) of any authorized denomination and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. Such temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every temporary Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series. Without unnecessary delay the Company will execute and will furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge to the holders, at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 4.02 for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such series, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of such series, unless the Company advises the Trustee to the effect that definitive Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged, temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
Section 2.07 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall execute a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon the Company's written request the Trustee (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall authenticate and deliver, such Security. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant's Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any Officer. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security that has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company, instead of issuing a substitute Security, may pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every replacement Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.08 .
Cancellation
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On written request of the Company at the time of such surrender, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.09 .
Benefits of Indenture
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained;
 
all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Securities.
Section 2.10 .
Authenticating Agent
So long as any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding, there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. The Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series, including Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions, it shall resign immediately. Any Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee at any time may, and upon request by the Company shall, terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto.
Section 2.11 .

If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security, then the Company shall execute one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the Outstanding Securities of such series, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee and (iii) shall be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary or otherwise delivered pursuant to the Depositary's instructions and the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.04 shall authenticate such Global Security or Global Securities.

Section 2.12 .
CUSIP Numbers
The Company in issuing the Securities of a series may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that
 
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
Section 2.13 .
Securities Denominated in Foreign Currencies
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, Securities of such series denominated in any Foreign Currency will be made in such Foreign Currency.
In the event any Foreign Currency or Currencies in which any payment with respect to any series of Securities may be made ceases to be a freely convertible Currency on United States Currency markets, for any date thereafter on which payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of a series is due, the Company shall select the Currency of payment for use on such date, all as provided in the Securities of such series, in a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. In such event, the Company shall notify the Trustee of the Currency which it has selected to constitute the funds necessary to meet the Company's obligations on such payment date and of the amount of such Currency to be paid. Such amount shall be determined as provided in the Securities of such series, in a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. The payment with respect to such payment date shall be deposited with the Trustee by the Company solely in the Currency so selected.
Section 2.14 .
Wire Transfers
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company may make any payment required to be deposited with the Trustee on account of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Securities by any method of wire transfer to an account designated in writing by the Trustee such that funds are available on or before 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date such payment is to be made to the Holders of the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 2.15 .

(a) the obligation, if any, of the Company to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of any series in a Foreign Currency or Dollars (the "") as may be specified pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(12) is of the essence and agree that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, judgments in respect of Securities of such series shall be given in the Designated Currency;
Designated Currency
(b) the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities shall be discharged, notwithstanding any payment in any other Currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), only to the extent of the amount in the Designated Currency that the Securityholder receiving such payment, in accordance with normal banking procedures, may purchase with the amount paid in such other Currency after any premium and cost of exchange on the business day in the country of issue of the Designated Currency or in the international banking community immediately following the day on which such Securityholder receives such payment;
 
(c) if the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and
(d) any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect.
Section 3.01 .
Redemption
The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01.
Section 3.02 .
Notice of Redemption
(a) If the Company desires to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, or shall instruct the Trustee in writing to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register (unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed). Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that: (i) payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, or, if none, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities; (ii) interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice; (iii) from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; (iv) the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and (v) the CUSIP and/or other similar number as contemplated by, and containing the disclaimers and other language contemplated by, Section 2.12. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
 
(b) If all or less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 15 days' written notice (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) in advance of the date the Company gives notice to the Securityholders of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee thereupon shall select from Securities of such series Outstanding not previously called for redemption, in accordance with a method determined by the Trustee (in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of such Securities of such series of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Securities of such series to be redeemed. The Trustee promptly shall notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities of such series to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Company, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by any of its Officers, may instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section 3.02, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name, as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section 3.02.
Section 3.03 .
Payment Upon Redemption
(a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, in each case as established pursuant to Section 2.01. Interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, such Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, that, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Securityholders of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) registered as such at the close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03.
(b) Upon presentation of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute a new Security of the same series and tenor of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and the Trustee shall authenticate, and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, such Security; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute a new Global Security of like tenor in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered and, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate requesting authentication and delivery, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, such Global Security.

The provisions of this Section 3.04 and Sections 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.

Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
The Company (i) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any Securities previously called for redemption) and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.06 .
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of the series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency in which the Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.01), the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit. Together with such Officer's Certificate, the Company will deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 15 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
The following covenants shall apply to the Securities, except with respect to any series of Securities for which the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series expressly provides that any such covenant shall not apply to such series of Securities:

Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
 
The Company will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of a series at the time and place and in the manner provided herein and established with respect to such Securities.

So long as any series of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Company will maintain for such series an office or agency where Securities of such series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series and this Indenture may be given or served. Such designation will continue with respect to each office or agency until the Company, by written notice signed by any Officer and delivered to the Trustee, shall designate some other office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

(b) The Company shall require each paying agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the paying agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all funds held by the paying agent for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities, and will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the paying agent (including the Company or any of their Subsidiaries serving as the paying agent) shall have no further liability for the funds. If the Company or any of their Subsidiaries acts as paying agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Securityholders all funds held by it as paying agent.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (i) the agreement to hold funds in trust as provided in this Section 4.03 is subject to the provisions of Section 11.06, and (ii) the Company at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of this Indenture or for any other purpose, may pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all funds held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such funds to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such funds were held by the Company or such paying agent. Upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such funds.
Section 4.04 .
Statement by Officers as to Default
 
So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a brief certificate (which need not comply with Section 13.06) executed by any two Officers of the Company, one of which shall be the principal executive, financial or accounting officer of the Company, on its behalf as to the Officer's respective knowledge of the Company's compliance with all covenants and agreements under this Indenture required to be complied with by the Company (such compliance to be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture).

The Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries may also, without equally and ratably securing the Securities, create or incur Liens that extend, renew, substitute or replace (including successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements), in whole or in part, any Lien permitted pursuant to this Section 4.07(b).

Section 6.01 .
Events of Default
(a) Whenever used herein with respect to Securities of a particular series, "Event of Default" means any one or more of the following events that has occurred and is continuing, except with respect to any series of Securities for which the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series expressly provides that any such Event of Default shall not apply to such series of Securities:
(1) default in the payment of the principal or any premium on any Security of that series when due (whether at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise);
(2) default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any Security of such series when due;
(3) failure by the Company to observe or perform any term of the Indenture (other than those referred to in (1) or (2) above and other than a covenant or agreement included in this Indenture not for the benefit of such series) for a period of 60 days after the Company receives a notice of default stating that the Company is in breach. The notice must be sent by either the Trustee or Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the Securities of the affected series;
(4) the entry by a court having competent jurisdiction of:
(A) an order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law and such order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(B) a final and non-appealable order appointing a Custodian, of the Company, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company, and such order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days;
(5) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or the consent by the Company to the entry of a decree or order for relief in an involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or the filing by the Company of a consent to an order for relief in any involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or to the appointment of a Custodian or the making by the Company of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
 
(6) any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series.
(b) In each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) or 6.01(a)(5)), unless the principal of all the Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the unpaid principal of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) or 6.01(a)(5) occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
(c) At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the amount due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has or has caused to be paid or deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit), and (ii) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series that shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06.
No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceedings, the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
(e) The Trustee shall give to the Securityholders of any series, as the names and addresses of such Holders appear on the Security Register, notice by mail of all defaults known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee that have occurred with respect to such series, such notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice (the term "default" or "defaults" for the purposes of this Section 6.01(e) being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such
 
notice if and so long as its board of directors, executive committee, or trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
Section 6.02 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
(a) The Company covenants that (i) in case it shall default in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of a series, or any payment required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to that series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days, or (ii) in case it shall default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, on any of the Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of a series or upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have been become due and payable on all such Securities for principal, premium, if any, or interest, or both, with interest upon the overdue principal, premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
(b) If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the amounts so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company and collect the amounts adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, wherever situated.
(c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceedings affecting the Company or its respective creditors or property, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company under this Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount that may become due and payable by the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any funds or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 6.03. Any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
(d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto. Any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
 
In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee in its discretion may proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.03 .

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Securities of such series for principal, premium, if any, and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such funds have been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: To the Company.
Section 6.04 .
Limitation on Suits
No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default; (ii) the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and (v) during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security (or in the
 
case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder. By accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6.04, each Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
Section 6.05 .
Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission not Waiver
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article VI to the Trustee or to the Securityholders, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Securities.
(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or on acquiescence therein. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
Section 6.06 .
Control by Securityholders
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Securities of any other series at the time Outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture and may decline to follow any such direction unless the holders shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series, may rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a default (i) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series; or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former
 
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.07 .
Undertaking to Pay Costs
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by such holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 6.07 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.
Section 6.08 .
Waiver of Usury, Stay Or Extension Laws
Each of the Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 7.01 .
Certain Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee
(a) In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (that has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Company has been prejudiced by such failure. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate, to the extent reasonable, in the defense of any such claim, and, if (in the opinion of counsel to the Trustee) the facts and/or issues surrounding the claim are reasonably likely to create a conflict with the Company, the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to the Trustee. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.06 to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses and disbursements shall: (i) be secured by a lien prior to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Securities; and (ii) survive the termination of this Indenture and resignation or removal of the Trustee.
(c) When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law.

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation.
If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding at any time may remove the Trustee with respect to such series upon 30 days' written notice to the Trustee and the Company and may appoint a successor Trustee for such series with the consent of the Company.

Acceptance of Appointment By Successor
(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee. On the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee, upon payment of its charges, shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and funds held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
 
wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (ii) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, and such retiring Trustee shall have no further responsibility with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture.

(c) Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company may execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in Section 7.11(a) or (b), as the case may be.
(d) No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article VII.
(e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 7.11, the successor trustee shall cause a notice of its succession to be transmitted to Securityholders.

Section 8.01 .
Evidence of Action by Securityholders
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided, however, that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 6.01, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 6.04 or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 6.06, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the
 
record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided, however, that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
Section 8.02 .
Proof of Execution by Securityholders
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
(b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
(c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
Section 8.03 .
Who May be Deemed Owners
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other
 
purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 8.04 .
Certain Securities Owned by Company Disregarded
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent of waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by an Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not an Affiliate. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities of a particular series, if any known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described Persons and, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities of such particular series not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Section 8.05 .
Actions Binding on Future Securityholders
At any time prior to the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, may revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.
Section 9.01 .

(g) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;
(h) to secure the Securities of any series;
(i) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder of Outstanding Securities;

Section 11.03 .
Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations; Covenant Defeasance
(a) If at any time:
(i) all such Securities of a particular series not heretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that have not become due and payable as described in Section 11.02 shall have been paid by the Company by depositing irrevocably with the Trustee in trust funds or an amount of Governmental Obligations sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all such Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal, premium, if any, and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be, and
 
(ii) the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series,
then, after the date such funds or Governmental Obligations, as the case may be, are deposited with the Trustee, the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such series shall cease to be of further effect except, to the extent applicable, for the following provisions that shall survive until such Securities shall mature and be paid: (A) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 11.03(c) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when due, (B) the Company's obligation with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 4.02, 4.03, 7.05 and 7.10 hereof, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article XI.

For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of a series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a)(3) or otherwise, but except as specified in this Section 11.03(b), the remainder of the Company's obligations under the Securities of such series, this Indenture, and any indentures supplemental to this Indenture with respect to such series shall be unaffected thereby.

(ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent specified herein relating to defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with, and an Opinion of Counsel to the same effect;
 
(iii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become such an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, on the date of such deposit;
(iv) in the event of an election under Section 11.03(a), the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge were not to occur;
(v) in the event of an election under Section 11.03(b), the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and covenant defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and covenant defeasance were not to occur; and
(vi) notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 11.03, such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Company pursuant to Section 2.01.

Section 11.07 .
Reinstatement
If the Trustee or paying agent is unable to apply any funds or Governmental Obligations in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture, any indentures supplemental to this Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Securities and the Securities of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.02 or 11.03, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all such funds or Governmental Obligations in accordance with Section 11.02 or 11.03, as the case may be; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities of such series following the reinstatement of its obligations as aforesaid, the Company, as applicable, shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Securities of such series to receive such payment from the funds or Governmental Obligations held by the Trustee or paying agent.

The Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture is referred to herein as the "Indenture." By the terms of the Base Indenture, the debt securities issuable thereunder are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture. This security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (individually, a "Security," and collectively, the "Securities"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Securities (the "Securityholders"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given them in the Base Indenture or the First Supplemental Indenture, as applicable.

The Company will pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date"). If any Interest Payment Date, Optional Redemption Date or maturity date of this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date to the date of such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; provided that, if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a regular record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be June 15, 2013. Interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to NetApp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on November 30, 2012 of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), that is automatically effective under the Act pursuant to Rule 462(e) promulgated thereunder. The Registration Statement relates to, among other things, the proposed issuance and sale, from time to time, by the Company of debt securities with an indeterminate amount as may at various times be issued at indeterminate prices, in reliance on Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(e) under the Act.
Under the Registration Statement, the Company has issued $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December 12, 2012 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 12, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated December 5, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined the Registration Statement, together with the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein; the base prospectus, dated November 30, 2012, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, filed with the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"); the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated December 5, 2012, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes; the final prospectus supplement, dated December 5, 2012, in the form filed with Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes (collectively with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus Supplement"); the Indenture and the Notes. In addition, we have examined such other instruments, documents, certificates and records which we have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of our opinion hereinafter expressed. In such examination, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; (iii) the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates we have reviewed; (iv) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the parties thereto (other than the Company); (v) the legal capacity of all natural persons; and (vi) that the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture

and that the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company.
We express no opinion as to any matter relating to laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and the laws of the State of New York, as such are in effect on the date hereof, and we have made no inquiry into, and we express no opinion as to, the statutes, regulations, treaties, common laws or other laws of any other nation, state or jurisdiction. We are not licensed to practice law in the State of Delaware and, accordingly, our opinions as to the DGCL are based solely on a review of the official statutes of the State of Delaware and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such statues and provisions.
We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) rights to indemnification and contribution which may be limited by applicable law or equitable principles, or (iii) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, the effect of judicial discretion and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, and limitations on rights of acceleration, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
On the basis of the foregoing and in reliance thereon and having regard for legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you that in our opinion the Notes have been validly issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the above-referenced Registration Statement and to the use of our name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and in any amendment or supplement thereto. In giving such consent, we do not believe that we are "experts" within the meaning of such term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion as an exhibit or otherwise.
Very truly yours,
