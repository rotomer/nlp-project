NEWS RELEASE Exhibit 99 Northern Trust Corporation 50 South LaSalle Street Chicago, Illinois 60675 Contact: Bev Fleming, Investor Relations (312) 444-7811 or Katherine Sopranos, Public Relations Release #01524 (312) 444-4281 http://www.northerntrust.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS 2002 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $.56 PER SHARE. (Chicago, July 15, 2002) Northern Trust Corporation reported net income per common share of $.56 for the second quarter, a decrease of 2% from the $.57 per share earned a year ago. Net income totaled $126.8 million, compared to $131.3 million reported in the second quarter of last year. This performance resulted in a return on average common equity of 18.57%. William A. Osborn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The business environment remains very challenging given the significant and prolonged weakness in equity markets. Nevertheless, Northern achieved earnings of $.56 per share, just below the record results in last year's second quarter. We achieved this performance by aggressively managing expenses, which were up just 1% compared to last year. Revenues were essentially unchanged from last year, after adjusting for a $9.2 million nonrecurring gain in the prior year's second quarter. Trust assets under administration totaled $1.66 trillion, a decrease of less than 1% from a year ago, and assets under management fell a modest 4% to $327.4 billion. We continue to invest the necessary resources in our business and remain confident in our competitive position and focused strategy." SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Revenues of $563.6 million were flat relative to last year's second quarter, after adjusting for the $9.2 million nonrecurring gain on the sale of an 80% interest in Northern Trust's lockbox -more-
-2- SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) operations last year. Trust fees were $312.6 million in the quarter, down 2% compared to $317.7 million in the second quarter of last year. Trust fees represented 55% of total second quarter revenues and total fee-related income represented 71% of total revenues. Trust fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) in the quarter decreased slightly and totaled $153.9 million compared to $154.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in PFS trust fees primarily resulted from the weakness in the equity markets, partially offset by new business. Personal trust assets under administration totaled $163.4 billion at June 30, 2002 compared to $161.1 billion at June 30, 2001 and $166.8 billion at December 31, 2001. Of the total assets under administration, $91.8 billion is managed by Northern Trust, compared to $94.7 billion one year ago. Net new recurring PFS trust business transitioned during the first six months totaled approximately $22 million in annualized fees. Trust fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) in the quarter decreased 3% to $158.7 million compared to $163.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline resulted from lower securities lending fees, which totaled $33.4 million compared to $42.7 million in last year's second quarter. In the prior year, securities lending spreads benefited from three decreases in the federal funds rate during the quarter. Driven primarily by growth in institutional money market funds, fees from asset management increased 4% and totaled $46.4 million compared to $44.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Custody fees increased 1% to $51.1 million. Northern Trust Retirement Consulting, L.L.C. recorded fees of $17.2 million compared to $15.1 million in last year's second quarter. C&IS trust assets under administration totaled $1.50 trillion at June 30, 2002, compared to $1.52 trillion at both June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001. Of the C&IS trust assets under administration, $235.6 billion is managed by Northern Trust, down from $246.8 billion at June 30, 2001, but essentially unchanged from $236.1 billion at year-end. Trust assets under administration include $496.4 billion of global custody assets, up 13% from a year ago, reflecting strong new business in this area. Net new recurring C&IS trust business transitioned during the first six months totaled approximately $26 million in annualized fees. -more-
-3- SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) Foreign exchange trading profits were $36.9 million for the quarter, compared to $40.5 million in the second quarter of last year and $24.3 million in the first quarter of 2002. The improvement from the first quarter reflects higher client trading volumes and greater market volatility in the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. Treasury management revenues, which include both fees and the computed value of compensating deposit balances, were $29.3 million, up 2% from last year's second quarter, due to new business and higher transaction volumes from existing clients. The fee portion of these revenues in the quarter was $23.5 million, up 14% from $20.6 million in the comparable quarter last year, partly as a result of more clients electing to pay for services in fees rather than in compensating deposit balances. Revenues from security commissions and trading income were $9.7 million, up 13% from the prior year. Other operating income was $17.6 million for the second quarter compared to $27.0 million in the same period last year, which included a $9.2 million nonrecurring gain. After adjusting for this one-time gain, other operating income was essentially unchanged from last year. Net interest income for the quarter, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $163.2 million, up 2% from $160.7 million reported in the prior year quarter. Total average earning assets of $33.0 billion were essentially unchanged from last year's second quarter. The net interest margin improved to 1.99% from 1.96% in the prior year quarter and 1.92% in the first quarter of 2002. Loan volume averaged $17.6 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $5.0 million in the quarter compared to $11.5 million for the same quarter last year and $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2002. The prior year quarter included $6.5 million related to the sale of $44.5 million in nonperforming loans. Net charge-offs in the quarter also totaled $5.0 million. Nonperforming assets totaled $110.6 million at June 30, 2002, down from $118.7 million at March 31, 2002 and up from $109.4 million at June 30, 2001. The $160.3 million reserve for credit losses at June 30, 2002 represented a reserve to loan ratio -more-
-4- SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) of .88%, unchanged from a year ago. Nonaccrual loans of $109.7 million at quarter-end represented .60% of total loans and were covered 1.46 times by the reserve. Noninterest expenses totaled $355.9 million for the quarter, up 1% from $351.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Expenses continue to be closely monitored through various initiatives implemented by management to control certain expense categories, including controlling staff levels and limiting staff-related and other discretionary costs. Compensation and employee benefits represented 56% of total operating expenses and totaled $200.9 million, down 3% from a year ago as lower performance-based pay and the transfer of staff to the lockbox joint venture more than offset salary increases and higher benefit costs. The cost of lockbox operations is now included in other operating expenses as a direct payment to the joint venture for services. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at June 30, 2002 totaled 9,384, a decline of 69 positions since year-end and an increase of 1% from a year ago, after adjusting for the impact of the lockbox joint venture. Other expense categories reflect increased costs associated with processing errors incurred in servicing and managing financial assets and performing banking activities, technology investments, office expansion, and payments made to the lockbox joint venture. These increases were partially offset by initiatives to manage costs that resulted in decreases in various expenses, including travel, hiring and other discretionary costs. The adoption of new accounting requirements in 2002 to eliminate goodwill amortization costs also reduced expenses by $2.6 million or $2.1 million after-tax. BALANCE SHEET Balance sheet assets averaged $37.1 billion for the quarter, up 2% from last year's second quarter average of $36.3 billion. Money market assets averaged $8.7 billion, up from $4.5 billion last year while the securities portfolio averaged $6.6 billion, down from $10.3 billion last year. Loans and leases averaged $17.6 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. -more-
-5- BALANCE SHEET (continued) Residential mortgages increased $641 million, or 9%, to average $7.6 billion for the quarter and represented 43% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial loans averaged $4.3 billion, down $780 million or 15% from a year ago, while the remainder of the loan portfolio had a net decline of $215 million on average. Common stockholders' equity averaged a record $2.7 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. The increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings, offset in part by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share buyback program. During the quarter, the Corporation acquired a total of 773,031 shares at a cost of $40.7 million. An additional 3.0 million shares may be purchased after June 30, 2002 under the current share buyback program. SIX-MONTH PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Net income per common share of $1.12 was unchanged from the same period of 2001.

Trust fees totaled $629.0 million, up 1% from $622.9 million last year. Foreign exchange trading profits totaled $61.2 million, 19% below the $75.4 million in the prior year. Treasury management revenues from both fees and the computed value of compensating deposit balances increased 2% to $59.0 million. Net interest income, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $324.1 million compared to $322.7 million reported last year. The $10.0 million provision for credit losses was $6.5 million lower than the $16.5 million required in 2001. Net charge-offs totaled $11.3 million and represented .13% of average loans compared to $19.7 million or .22% of average loans in 2001.
