NEWS RELEASE Exhibit 99 Northern Trust Corporation 50 South LaSalle Street Chicago, Illinois 60675 Contact: Bev Fleming, Investor Relations (312) 444-7811 or Katherine Sopranos, Public Relations (312) 444-4281 http://www.northerntrust.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS EXPECTED THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $.43 PER SHARE (Chicago, October 4, 2002) Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ: NTRS) reported today that it has taken a $15 million pre-tax charge ($9 million after-tax or $.04 per share), reflecting the complete write-off of its investment in myCFO, Inc. Northern Trust Corporation expects to report third quarter net income per common share of $.43 compared to $.55 per share in the third quarter of 2001. Results in the third quarter also were impacted by a higher provision for credit losses and lower trust fees and foreign exchange trading profits. The third quarter provision for credit losses of $20 million reflected the impact of recently completed Shared National Credit reviews. Net charge-offs in the quarter were approximately $12 million. The combination of the increased provision for credit losses and the net charge-offs increased the reserve for credit losses at September 30, 2002 to approximately $168 million. Nonperforming assets of approximately $110 million were comparable to the $110.6 million at June 30, 2002. William A. Osborn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "We are disappointed to report the write-off of our investment in myCFO, Inc. The third quarter presented continuing challenges, with the persistent decline in the equity markets and reduced capital markets activity resulting in lower trust fees and foreign exchange trading profits. Despite the current difficult market and economic conditions, we remain confident in our highly focused business strategy."
