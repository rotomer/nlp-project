(Chicago, October 16, 2002) Northern Trust Corporation reported net income per common share of $.43 for the third quarter, compared to the $.55 per share earned a year ago. Net income totaled $96.4 million, compared to $126.6 million reported in the third quarter of last year. This performance resulted in a return on average common equity of 13.69%. The current quarter's results include the previously announced $15.0 million write-off ($.04 per common share) of an equity investment in myCFO, Inc. and $20.0 million provision for credit losses. William A. Osborn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Although the investment write-off and the higher provision were major factors impacting our results this quarter, unfavorable business conditions and the significant and persistent declines in the equity markets also have continued to adversely influence our performance. Despite these business conditions and after net charge-offs, our nonperforming asset levels declined this quarter to $107.6 million at September 30, 2002 from $110.6 million at June 30, 2002. In this difficult environment, we continue to closely manage expenses, which were up just 2% compared to last year's third quarter and 1% for the first nine months." Mr. Osborn continued, "We continue to invest in our core strategies. During the quarter, we announced our agreement to expand our asset management capabilities by acquiring Deutsche Bank's global passive equity, enhanced equity and passive fixed income businesses, which will significantly increase our assets under management. When completed, the acquisition will position Northern Trust as the third largest U.S. institutional index manager." -more-
-2- THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Revenues of $532.6 million were 5% below the $559.5 million reported in last year's third quarter. Approximately half of this decline was the result of the write-off of myCFO, Inc. due to the pending sale of that company's assets. Trust fees were $298.0 million in the quarter, down 4% compared to $311.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Trust fees represented 56% of total third quarter revenues, and total fee-related income represented 70% of total revenues. Trust assets under administration and assets under management (as revised in the supplemental financial information) declined 8% to $1.44 trillion, and 7% to $293.2 billion, respectively. Trust fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) in the quarter decreased 4% and totaled $147.5 million, compared to $153.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in PFS trust fees primarily resulted from the continued decline in the equity markets, partially offset by new business. Personal trust assets under administration totaled $150.7 billion at September 30, 2002, compared to $149.8 billion at September 30, 2001 and $166.8 billion at December 31, 2001. Of the total assets under administration, $85.8 billion is managed by Northern Trust, compared to $89.8 billion one year ago. Net new recurring PFS trust business transitioned during the first nine months totaled approximately $29 million in annualized fees. Trust fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) in the quarter decreased 4% to $150.5 million compared to $157.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline resulted from lower securities lending fees, which totaled $17.0 million compared to $29.3 million in last year's third quarter. In the prior year quarter, securities lending fees benefited from two decreases in the federal funds rate and higher volumes. Fees from asset management increased 2% and totaled $47.4 million, compared to $46.6 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by growth in institutional money market funds. Custody fees increased 4% to $56.8 million. Northern Trust Retirement Consulting, L.L.C. recorded fees of $16.6 million, compared to $16.1 million in last year's third quarter. -more-
-3- THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) C&IS trust assets under administration totaled $1.29 trillion at September 30, 2002, compared to $1.42 trillion at September 30, 2001 and $1.51 trillion at December 31, 2001. Of the C&IS trust assets under administration, $207.4 billion is managed by Northern Trust, down from $226.3 billion at September 30, 2001. Trust assets under administration include $448.5 billion of global custody assets, up 6% from a year ago. Net new recurring C&IS trust business transitioned during the first nine months totaled approximately $29 million in annualized fees. Foreign exchange trading profits were $26.3 million for the quarter, compared to $37.2 million in the third quarter of last year. The current quarter reflects lower client volumes and reduced market volatility in major currencies. Treasury management revenues, which include both fees and the computed value of compensating deposit balances, were $29.9 million, up 2% from last year's third quarter, due to new business and higher transaction volumes from existing clients. The fee portion of these revenues in the quarter was $23.9 million, up 11% from $21.5 million in the comparable quarter last year, partly as a result of more clients paying for services in fees rather than in compensating deposit balances. Revenues from security commissions and trading income were $11.6 million, up 43% from the prior year. Other operating income was $10.6 million for the third quarter, compared to $20.0 million in the same period last year. Current quarter other operating income was reduced by the $15.0 million write-off of the investment in myCFO, Inc., offset in part by the recognition of approximately $8.5 million in gains by Norlease, Inc. from the sales of leased equipment in the normal course of business at the end of scheduled lease terms. Net interest income for the quarter, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $162.1 million, compared to $161.6 million reported in the prior year quarter. Total average earning assets of $32.4 billion were 3% higher than a year ago, with the increase concentrated in the money market portfolio, partially offset by lower levels of securities and loans. The net interest margin decreased to 1.98% from 2.05% in the prior year quarter, but was virtually -more-
-4- THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) unchanged from 1.99% in the second quarter of 2002. Loans averaged $17.6 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $20.0 million in the quarter, compared to $5.0 million for the same quarter last year and $5.0 million in each of the first two quarters of 2002. The third quarter provision reflects the impact of management's ongoing credit evaluations and the results of the annual, industry-wide Shared National Credit regulatory reviews. Net charge-offs in the quarter totaled $11.9 million and included the complete charge-off, totaling $10.0 million, of Northern Trust's remaining unsecured Enron Corp. exposure. Nonperforming assets totaled $107.6 million at September 30, 2002, down from $110.6 million at June 30, 2002 and $115.8 million at September 30, 2001. Total reserves available for credit losses totaled $168.4 million and included $8.1 million allocated to loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures. The $160.3 million reserve assigned to loans at September 30, 2002 represented a reserve to loan ratio of .89%, compared to .80% a year ago. Nonaccrual loans of $106.5 million at quarter-end represented .59% of total loans and were covered 1.5 times by the reserve. Noninterest expenses totaled $357.2 million for the quarter, up 2% from $351.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Expenses continue to be closely monitored through various initiatives implemented by management to control certain expense categories, including controlling staff levels and limiting staff-related and other discretionary costs. Compensation and employee benefits represented 57% of total operating expenses and totaled $204.0 million, virtually unchanged from a year ago, as lower performance-based pay offset salary increases and higher benefit costs. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at September 30, 2002 totaled 9,328, a decline of 125 positions since year-end. Between June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002 staff declined 56 positions on a full-time equivalent basis. Other expense categories reflected increased costs associated with technology investments, office expansion, relocation of London Branch staff to Canary Wharf and lockbox servicing payments. These increases were partially offset by initiatives to manage costs that -more-
-5- THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) resulted in decreases in various expenses, including travel, hiring and other discretionary costs. The adoption of new accounting requirements in 2002 to eliminate goodwill amortization costs also reduced expenses by $2.2 million or $1.8 million after-tax. BALANCE SHEET Balance sheet assets averaged $36.5 billion for the quarter, up 4% from last year's third quarter average of $35.1 billion. Money market assets averaged $8.3 billion, up from $5.7 billion last year, while the securities portfolio averaged $6.5 billion, down from $7.7 billion last year. Loans and leases averaged $17.6 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the prior year. Residential mortgages increased $563 million, or 8%, to average $7.8 billion for the quarter, and represented 44% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial loans averaged $4.2 billion, down $646 million or 13% from a year ago, while the remainder of the loan portfolio had a net decline of $215 million on average. Common stockholders' equity averaged a record $2.8 billion, up 9% from last year's third quarter. The increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings offset in part by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share buyback program. During the quarter, the Corporation acquired a total of 1.1 million shares at a cost of $43.4 million. An additional 1.9 million shares are authorized to be purchased after September 30, 2002 under the previously announced share buyback program. NINE-MONTH PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Net income per common share of $1.54 was 7% lower than the $1.66 reported in the same period of 2001. Net income was $350.8 million, compared to $385.1 million earned last year, and resulted in a return on average common equity of 17.16%. Total revenues decreased 2% from 2001 levels. Trust fees totaled $940.1 million, down 1% from $947.8 million last year. Foreign exchange trading profits totaled $87.5 million, down -more-
-6- NINE-MONTH PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued) 22% from the $112.6 million in the prior year. Treasury management revenues from both fees and the computed value of compensating deposit balances increased 2% to $89.9 million. Net interest income, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $486.2 million, compared to $484.3 million reported last year. The $30.0 million provision for credit losses was $8.5 million higher than the $21.5 million provision in 2001. Net charge-offs totaled $23.2 million and represented .18% of average loans, compared to $26.3 million or .20% of average loans in 2001. Noninterest expenses were up 1% and totaled $1.07 billion, compared to $1.06 billion a year ago.
