(NTRC), Northern Trust's retirement consulting and administration business. Hewitt and Northern Trust have also agreed to work together as preferred providers in each firm's core area of expertise -- HR outsourcing and consulting services from Hewitt, and trustee, custody and pension payroll services from Northern Trust. As part of this arrangement, Hewitt will acquire the NTRC business, which provides nearly 200 companies and more than 1 million participants with defined benefit, defined contribution and retiree health and welfare administration services, including recordkeeping and customer service. The arrangement also covers retirement consulting and actuarial services, including plan design and communication. Effective with the transition, NTRC clients covered by this arrangement will have access to Hewitt's full suite of outsourcing and consulting services. Hewitt will assume responsibility for NTRC's staff and facilities in Atlanta, Ga. The transaction is expected to close in June. "Our acquisition of NTRC represents an additional growth opportunity for our outsourcing and consulting business," said Bryan Doyle, global business leader, HR and benefits outsourcing services, Hewitt Associates. "We look forward to working with Northern Trust to provide clients with the retirement services expertise that has made us recognized leaders in the industry." "With this agreement, we bring to our clients the world-class retirement services Hewitt offers, combined in a seamless structure with Northern Trust's leading institutional trust and custody services," said Rick Waddell, president of corporate and institutional services at Northern Trust. "The arrangement advances our long-term strategy to focus our own resources on the areas where we can serve clients best." In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, NTRC had gross revenues of approximately $74 million. Hewitt anticipates the acquisition will be modestly dilutive through the transition period. Northern Trust expects to recognize charges totaling approximately $20 million as a result of the transaction, principally reflecting the write-off of unamortized technology investments. The purchase price and other financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and satisfaction of any conditions contained in it.
