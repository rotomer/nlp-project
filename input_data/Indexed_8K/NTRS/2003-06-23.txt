(CHICAGO, June 23, 2003) Today Northern Trust Corporation announced that as part of an ongoing review of its business and operations it has taken a number of strategic steps to reduce expenses and better position the Corporation for improved profitability. Northern Trust implemented actions that, together with transactions announced earlier in the quarter, will result in a second quarter net pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $51.5 million. This will impact reported earnings per share by $.14 for the second quarter 2003. Of this charge, approximately $23.5 million represents severance costs relating to the elimination of approximately 700 positions, the majority of which occurred in June. When this staff reduction is fully implemented, and giving effect to the approximately 690 person reduction associated with the sale of the assets of Northern Trust Retirement Consulting, L.L.C. (NTRC) and other previously announced second quarter transactions, total staff is expected to be less than 8,000 positions, down from 9,336 at March 31, 2003, a 15% reduction. The remainder of the charge reflects: . Reduction in the amount of office space leased and owned as a result of lower staff levels ($16.1 million); . Standardization of software applications across business units and replacement of existing software with more cost-effective solutions ($9.5 million); and . Two other strategic transactions that were previously announced in April and closed in June; the sale of NTRC assets ($20.2 million loss) and the sale of the Higgins Road Chicago retail branch ($17.8 million gain). NTRC had gross revenues of $74.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. -more-
