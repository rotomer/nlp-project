FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS 2004 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $.57 PER SHARE, UP 36% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.
 
(Chicago, April 20, 2004) Northern Trust Corporation today reported net income per common share of $.57 for the first quarter, an increase of 36% from $.42 per share earned a year ago. Net income increased 35% to $127.5 million from $94.7 million earned in the first quarter of last year. This performance resulted in a return on average common equity of 16.74%.
 
William A. Osborn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased with this quarter's strong earnings. This performance was driven by record trust fees, increased foreign exchange trading profits and continued improvement in credit quality. In addition, assets under administration rose 44% to $2.3 trillion while assets under management increased 43% to $521 billion, both reaching record levels. Northern Trust is well-positioned in dynamic segments of the financial services industry. Our focused strategy has enabled us to produce these results and positions us well for continued success."
 
 
Revenues from continuing operations of $578.2 million were up 14% from $509.1 million in last year's first quarter. The revenue improvement reflects record trust fees of $327.9 million in the quarter, up 17% from $280.6 million in the first quarter of last year, and foreign exchange trading profits of $41.4 million, up from $20.7 million last year. Trust fees represented 57% of total first quarter revenues, and total fee-related income represented 74% of total revenues.
 
Trust fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) in the quarter increased 12% and totaled $161.6 million compared with $144.4 million a year-ago. The increase in PFS trust fees resulted primarily from improved equity markets and net new business. Revenue growth was broad-based, with all states and our Wealth Management Group reporting year-over-year increases in trust fees. Personal trust assets under administration totaled $204.8 billion at March 31, 2004, compared with $195.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and $156.0 billion at March 31, 2003. Of the total assets under administration, $106.5 billion is managed by Northern Trust compared with $104.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $87.3 billion at March 31, 2003. Net new recurring PFS trust business transitioned during the first quarter represents approximately $9 million in annualized fees.
 
Trust fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) in the quarter were up 22% to $166.3 million from $136.2 million in the year-ago quarter reflecting strong growth in all products and services, improved equity markets and net new business. Custody fees increased 23% to $65.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong growth in global custody revenues, while fees from asset management grew 20% to $58.1 million. Securities lending fees totaled $27.9 million compared with $21.9 million in last year's first quarter, reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by lower spreads earned on the investment of collateral.
 
 
 
C&IS assets under administration totaled $2.08 trillion at March 31, 2004 compared with $1.96 trillion at December 31, 2003 and $1.43 trillion at March 31, 2003. C&IS assets under management totaled $414.3 billion compared with $374.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $278.0 billion at March 31, 2003. Assets under administration include $823.9 billion of global custody assets, an increase of 73% compared with $476.0 billion one year ago. Net new recurring C&IS trust business transitioned during the first quarter represents approximately $18 million in annualized fees.
 
Foreign exchange trading profits were $41.4 million in the quarter compared with $20.7 million in the first quarter of last year. The improvement reflects continued volatility in currency markets and increased client activity. Treasury management fees in the quarter were $23.0 million compared with $24.0 million in the same quarter last year. Revenues from security commissions and trading income were $14.5 million, up 13% from the prior year. Other operating income was $19.7 million for the first quarter compared with $17.5 million in the same period last year.
 
Net interest income for the quarter stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $151.7 million, down 1% from $153.5 million reported in the prior year quarter. The net interest margin decreased to 1.73% from 1.87% in the prior year quarter due primarily to a decline in the average yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the prior year refinancing activity. Total average earning assets of $35.2 billion were 6% higher than a year ago with the increase concentrated in securities and money market assets. Securities increased 9% and averaged $8.0 billion with the increase concentrated primarily in short-term U.S. agency securities. Average money market assets increased 18% to $9.9 billion while average loans declined 2% to $17.3 billion.
 
 
 
The reserve for credit losses was reduced by $5.7 million in the quarter reflecting a negative provision for credit losses of $5.0 million and net charge-offs of $.7 million, contributing $5.0 million to pre-tax income. Nonperforming loans totaled $71.6 million at March 31, 2004, down from $80.0 million at December 31, 2003 and $92.4 million at March 31, 2003. The reduction in the reserve reflects an overall improvement in credit quality as cash received on loans rated internally in the two lowest credit categories, which require higher reserves, reduced these outstandings to approximately $184 million, a decrease of $29 million during the quarter. Last year the provision was $5.0 million and net charge-offs totaled $3.4 million. Reserves available for credit losses totaled $151.5 million and included $8.1 million allocated to loan commitments and other off-balance sheet exposures. The remaining $143.4 million reserve assigned to loans and leases at March 31, 2004 represented a reserve to loan ratio of .84% compared with .90% a year ago. Nonperforming loans of $71.6 million at quarter-end represented .42% of total loans and were covered 2.0 times by the reserve assigned to loans and leases.
 
Noninterest expenses from continuing operations totaled $377.5 million for the quarter, up 8% from $349.5 million in the year-ago quarter.
 
Compensation and employee benefit expenses totaled $203.8 million compared with $192.5 million last year. These expenses reflect annual salary increases, higher incentive compensation and increased pension and medical plan costs. These increases were partially offset by lower staffing levels. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at March 31, 2004 totaled 7,994 compared with 8,683 a year ago. Staffing level declines were the result of the elimination of positions resulting from Northern Trust's previously disclosed strategic business review, offset in part by increases relating to staffing for new offices, and other strategic initiatives.
 
Other expense categories totaled $173.7 million, up 11% from $157.0 million last year. The increase reflects expenses associated with operating risks related to servicing and managing financial assets, investments in technology that increased software amortization, higher insurance premiums and fees for global custody and asset management sub-advisor
 
 
 
services. The first of these categories included an $11.6 million loss from securities processing activities related to a stock conversion offer. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses from strategic initiatives implemented in 2003 to reduce operating costs.
 
 
Balance sheet assets averaged $39.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% from last year's first quarter average of $37.5 billion. The securities portfolio averaged $8.0 billion, up 9% from last year, while money market assets averaged $9.9 billion, up 18%. Loans and leases averaged $17.3 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the prior year.
 
Residential mortgages averaged $7.9 billion in the quarter, up 2% from the prior year's first quarter, and represented 46% of the total average loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial loans averaged $3.4 billion, down 15% from $4.0 billion last year, while personal loans increased 4% to average $2.5 billion compared with $2.4 billion in last year's first quarter.
 
Common stockholders' equity averaged a record $3.1 billion, up 7% from last year's first quarter. The increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings offset in part by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share buyback program. During the quarter, the Corporation acquired 938,989 shares at a cost of $45.5 million. An additional 9.3 million shares are authorized for purchase after March 31, 2004 under the previously announced share buyback program.
