FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD 2004 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.59, UP 97% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.
 
(Chicago, July 21, 2004) Northern Trust Corporation today reported record net income per common share of $.59 for the second quarter, an increase of 97% from $.30 per share earned a year ago. Net income also increased 97% to $130.8 million from $66.6 million earned in the second quarter of last year. This performance resulted in a return on average common equity of 16.91%. The prior year's second quarter results included net charges totaling $.14 per common share relating to actions taken to reduce operating costs and strategically position Northern Trust for improved profitability and the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
William A. Osborn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "This quarter's strong performance was driven by record trust fees and foreign exchange trading profits, as well as continued improvement in credit quality. We are also pleased to report that assets under administration rose 26% to $2.3 trillion, while assets under management increased 25% to $527 billion, both reaching record levels. We continue to concentrate our resources on providing superior products and services in our target markets. This focused strategy allows us to build our franchise in dynamic segments of the financial services industry where we can best capitalize on our competitive position."
 
 
Revenues of $585.1 million were up 6% from $551.2 million in last year's second quarter. Adjusting for the prior year gain on the sale of a retail branch, revenues grew 10%. The revenue improvement reflects record trust fees of $336.2 million in the quarter, up 14% from $293.9 million in the second quarter of last year, and record foreign exchange trading profits of $47.5 million, up from $32.8 million last year. Trust fees represented 57% of total second quarter revenues, and total fee-related income represented 75% of total revenues.
 
Trust fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) in the quarter were up 20% to $176.2 million from $147.3 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong growth in all products and services, improved equity markets and net new business. Custody fees increased 28% to $69.0 million for the quarter, reflecting strong growth in global custody revenues, while fees from asset management grew 9% to $56.4 million. Securities lending fees increased 29% to $36.3 million reflecting higher lending volumes, partially offset by lower spreads earned on the investment of collateral. Securities lending volume in both years' second quarters benefited from the international dividend season.
 
C&IS assets under administration totaled $2.09 trillion at June 30, 2004 compared with $1.96 trillion at December 31, 2003 and $1.66 trillion at June 30, 2003. C&IS assets under management totaled $422.5 billion compared with $374.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $329.2 billion at June 30, 2003. Assets under administration include $828.5 billion of global custody assets, an increase of 41% compared with $589.2 billion one year ago. Net new recurring C&IS trust business transitioned during the first six months is estimated to represent approximately $31 million in annualized fees.
 
Trust fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) in the quarter increased 9% and totaled $160.0 million compared with $146.6 million a year-ago. The increase in PFS trust fees resulted primarily from improved equity markets and net new business. Revenue growth was broad-based, with all regions and our Wealth Management Group reporting year-over-year
 
 
 
increases in trust fees. Personal trust assets under administration totaled $205.5 billion at June 30, 2004, compared with $195.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and $172.9 billion at June 30, 2003. Of the total assets under administration, $104.9 billion is managed by Northern Trust compared with $104.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and $94.2 billion at June 30, 2003. Net new recurring PFS trust business transitioned during the first six months is estimated to represent approximately $19 million in annualized fees.
 
Foreign exchange trading profits were a record $47.5 million in the quarter compared with $32.8 million in the second quarter of last year. The improvement reflects continued volatility in the major currencies and increased client activity. Treasury management fees in the quarter were $22.7 million compared with $24.3 million in the same quarter last year. Revenues from security commissions and trading income were $12.9 million compared with the record $15.0 million recorded in the prior year quarter. Other operating income was $19.2 million for the second quarter compared with $35.1 million in the same period last year. The prior year period included a $17.8 million gain from the sale of a retail branch.
 
Net interest income for the quarter stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $146.5 million, down 2% from $150.1 million reported in the prior year quarter. The decline is primarily the result of an interest adjustment in a client account recognized in the quarter. The net interest margin decreased to 1.60% from 1.76% in the prior year quarter due primarily to a decline in the average yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the prior year refinancing activity and the growth in lower margin short-term money market assets. Total average earning assets of $36.8 billion were 7% higher than a year ago with the increase concentrated in money market assets and securities. Average money market assets increased 28% to $11.0 billion. Securities increased 5% and averaged $8.5 billion with the increase concentrated primarily in short-term U.S. agency securities, while average loans declined 1% to $17.3 billion.
 
 
 
The reserve for credit losses at June 30, 2004 was virtually unchanged from the previous quarter-end level, reflecting no provision for credit losses and net charge-offs of $.1 million. Nonperforming loans totaled $67.1 million at June 30, 2004, down from $80.0 million at December 31, 2003 and $107.5 million at June 30, 2003. The provision for the prior year second quarter was $7.5 million and net charge-offs totaled $4.9 million. Reserves available for credit losses totaled $151.4 million and included $9.5 million allocated to loan commitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. The remaining $141.9 million reserve assigned to loans and leases at June 30, 2004 represented a reserve to loan ratio of .81% compared with .92% a year ago. Nonperforming loans of $67.1 million at quarter-end represented .38% of total loans and were covered 2.1 times by the reserve assigned to loans and leases.
 
Noninterest expenses totaled $377.2 million for the quarter, down 9% from $412.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The prior year quarter included expenses resulting from severance and outplacement costs ($22.9 million), reduced office space needs ($16.1 million) and the standardization, replacement and elimination of software ($9.5 million). The current year expenses reflect an increase of 4% after adjusting for these prior year items.
 
Compensation and employee benefit expenses totaled $209.7 million. This compares with $211.7 million last year, which included $19.5 million in severance-related costs. Current period compensation expense reflects annual salary increases and higher incentive compensation. Employee benefits increased 25% as a result of increased pension and health care costs and higher performance-based ESOP expense. The compensation and employee benefit increases were partially offset by lower staffing levels. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at June 30, 2004 totaled 8,030 compared with 8,239 a year ago. The decline in staffing levels resulted from Northern Trust's previously disclosed strategic business review, offset in part by staffing increases for new offices and other strategic initiatives.
 
 
 
Other expense categories totaled $167.5 million, down 17% from $200.8 million last year. The prior year quarter included the charges associated with reduced office space ($16.1 million), the standardization, replacement and elimination of software ($9.5 million) and outplacement benefits ($3.4 million). Other expenses decreased 3% after adjusting for these prior year items.
 
The provision for income taxes was $63.6 million for the second quarter compared with $36.7 million in the year ago quarter. The higher tax provision in 2004 primarily reflects the impact of higher earnings partially offset by the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters.
 
 
Balance sheet assets averaged $41.0 billion for the quarter, up 6% from last year's second quarter average of $38.6 billion. Money market assets averaged $11.0 billion, up 28% while the securities portfolio averaged $8.5 billion, up 5% from last year. Loans and leases averaged $17.3 billion for the quarter, down 1% from the prior year.
 
Residential mortgages averaged $7.9 billion in the quarter, up 2% from the prior year's second quarter, and represented 46% of the total average loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial loans averaged $3.4 billion, down 15% from $4.0 billion last year, while personal loans increased 1% to average $2.5 billion compared with last year's second quarter.
 
Common stockholders' equity averaged a record $3.1 billion, up 7% from last year's second quarter. The increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings offset in part by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share buyback program. During the quarter, the Corporation acquired 863,372 shares at a cost of $36.4 million. An additional 8.4 million shares are authorized for purchase after June 30, 2004 under the previously announced share buyback program.
 
 
 
Net income per common share of $1.15 was 60% higher than the $.72 reported in 2003. Net income was $258.3 million compared with $161.3 million earned last year and resulted in a return on average common equity of 16.83% and a return on average assets of 1.29%.
 
As a result of the 2003 second quarter sale of the assets of Northern Trust Retirement Consulting, L.L.C. (NTRC), its operating results for all periods presented have been shown as discontinued operations in Northern Trust's consolidated statement of income. The net income from discontinued operations in the current year totaled $.3 million compared with a $16.7 million net loss in the prior year, which included the $20.2 million pre-tax loss on the sale and NTRC's net loss from operations.
 
Revenues of $1.16 billion were up 10% from the $1.06 billion last year. Trust fees were $664.1 million for the period, up 16% compared with $574.5 million last year. Trust fees represented 57% of total revenues and total fee-related income represented 74% of total revenues.
 
Trust fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) increased 21% to $342.5 million from $283.5 million in the year-ago period. Custody fees increased 26% to $134.3 million for the period, reflecting strong growth in global custody revenues, while fees from asset management grew 14% to $114.5 million. Securities lending fees totaled $64.2 million compared with $50.1 million last year reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by lower spreads earned on the investment of collateral.
 
Trust fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) in the period increased 11% and totaled $321.6 million compared with $291.0 million last year. The increase in PFS trust fees resulted primarily from improved equity markets and net new business. Revenue growth was broad-based, with all regions and our Wealth Management Group reporting a year-over-year increase in trust fees.
 
 
 
Foreign exchange trading profits were $88.9 million in the period compared with $53.5 million last year. Treasury management fees were $45.7 million, down 5% from the comparable period last year. Revenues from security commissions and trading income were $27.4 million compared with $27.8 million in the prior year. Other operating income was $38.9 million for the period compared with $52.6 million in the same period last year. The prior year included a $17.8 million gain from the sale of a retail branch.
 
Net interest income for the six months, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $298.2 million, a decline of 2% from the $303.6 million reported in the prior year period. The net interest margin decreased to 1.66% from 1.81% in the prior year due in large part to a decline in the yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio due to the impact of refinancing activity and the growth in lower margin short-term money market assets. Total average earning assets of $36.0 billion were 7% higher than a year ago with the increase concentrated in money market assets, which were up 23% and averaged $10.4 billion for the period. Average securities increased 7% to average $8.3 billion while average loans were down 2% to $17.3 billion.
 
The 2004 provision for credit losses was a negative $5.0 million compared with $12.5 million required in 2003. Improved credit quality led to the negative provision for the current year. Net charge-offs totaled $.8 million and represented .01% of average loans compared with $8.3 million or .10% of average loans in 2003.
 
Noninterest expenses totaled $754.7 million for the period, down 1% from $762.0 million a year-ago. The prior year included the second quarter charges for severance, office space and software write-downs, which totaled $48.5 million.
 
Compensation and employee benefits represented 55% of total operating expenses and totaled $413.5 million. This compared with $404.2 million last year, which included $19.5 million in severance-related costs. The current period expenses reflect annual salary increases, higher incentive compensation and increased retirement and health care costs.
 
 
 
Other expense categories totaled $341.2 million for the period, down 5% from $357.8 million in 2003. The prior year included the costs associated with reduced office space ($16.1 million), the standardization, replacement and elimination of software ($9.5 million) and outplacement benefits ($3.4 million). The current period reflects higher expenses associated with investments in technology that increased software amortization, higher insurance premiums and growth driven increases in fees for global custody and asset management sub-advisor services, and higher costs associated with operating risks related to servicing and managing financial assets. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses from strategic initiatives implemented in 2003 to reduce operating costs.
