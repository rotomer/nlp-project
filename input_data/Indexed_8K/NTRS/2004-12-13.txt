On December 9, 2004, Dolores E. Cross resigned as a director of Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiary The Northern Trust Company, positions she has held since 1994. The U.S. Attorney's office in Atlanta announced on that date that a federal grand jury had indicted Dr. Cross for fraud in connection with grants and loans during her service at Morris Brown College. Dr. Cross has informed the Corporation that she needs to devote her full efforts to defending against the charges. The matters alleged in the indictment do not in any way relate to Dr. Cross's activities or responsibilities as a director of Northern Trust Corporation or The Northern Trust Company.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
