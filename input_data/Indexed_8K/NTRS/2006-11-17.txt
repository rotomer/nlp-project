Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On November 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") elected Nicholas D. Chabraja as a director of the Corporation and The Northern Trust Company, the Corporation's principal subsidiary (the "Bank"), effective January 1, 2007.
Mr. Chabraja, age 64, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Dynamics Corporation (a defense and other technology products manufacturer), a position he has held since 1997. He currently serves as a director of General Dynamics Corporation and Ceridian Corporation (a payroll, tax processing, and benefits administration company). General Dynamics is a client of the Bank and since January 1, 2006 has paid approximately $2.07 million to the Bank for credit product, trust/custody, securities lending, and related services.
A copy of the Corporation's press release announcing Mr. Chabraja's election is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted an amendment to the Corporation's By-laws. A copy of the By-laws, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The amendment to Article III of the Corporation's By-laws changes the provisions with respect to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. The amendment deletes the specific duties of the Committee from the By-laws and instead provides that the Committee shall perform such functions as the Board directs it to perform, as set forth in a Committee charter adopted by the Board.
The amendment took effect upon adoption by the Board of Directors.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On November 14, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Corporation amended the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines. A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The principal changes effected by the amendments to the Corporate Governance Guidelines were to: (i) require a director who resigns or is terminated from the primary position which the director held when elected to the Board to tender his or her resignation, effective only upon the Board's acceptance of the resignation; (ii) clarify when a director's resignation will become effective; (iii) clarify the factors that the Board may consider in deciding whether to accept a director's tendered resignation upon the director's failure to receive a majority of the votes in an uncontested election of directors; and (iv) reflect that all Board committees will have a charter approved by the Board.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the next day preceding the day on
which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to an adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered in the manner required by law to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the Corporation's stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(d) Only those who shall be stockholders of record on the record date so fixed as aforesaid shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after the applicable record date.

Such inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares of stock of the Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting and the voting power of each share; determine and report the number of shares represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; and do such other acts as are required by law or are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the stockholders. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be evidence thereof. The inspector or inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in performing their duties.

The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the presiding officer at the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

In all contested elections of Directors of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes present and voting will be required to elect a Director.
SECTION 1.7
Majority Vote Required.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the foregoing sentence, a stockholder may validly grant such authority by (a) executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, (b) authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder, or (c) any other means permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Attendance of any person at a meeting for which any notice whatever is required to be given under the provisions of these By-laws, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
SECTION 14.1
Waiver of Notice.
Adirector, officer or other person (the "Indemnitee") who seeks indemnification (other than advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 15.12 hereof), in respect of amounts paid or owing as expenses, judgments, fines, or in settlement, shall submit a written request for indemnification (the "Indemnification Request") to the Board of Directors of the Corporation by delivering or mailing the same, registered or certified mail, to the Board of Directors c/o the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices. If mailed, the Indemnification Request shall be deemed made 48 hours after depositing the same in the United States mail addressed as aforesaid.
SECTION 15.1
Indemnification Request.
The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification as set forth in the Indemnification Request shall be made in the specific case, at the expense of the Corporation, as set forth in paragraph 5 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. However, in the event a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, suchdetermination shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.
SECTION 15.2
Determination of Indemnification Request.
 
The termination with respect to the Indemnitee of any action, suit or proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the standard of conduct required by Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation for indemnification. If the Indemnitee is a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to have met the required standard of conduct but only to the extent not contrary to any final findings of fact or law made in any action, suit or proceeding to which the Indemnitee is or was a party and for which indemnification is requested. The person, persons or entity making the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be entitled to rely upon all such findings of fact and law made known to such person, persons or entity. Such person, persons or entity may consider such other matters as they or it deem appropriate, shall not be required to receive or hear evidence, oral presentations, briefs or other submission, shall not be required to hold hearings, and shall not otherwise be subject to any rules of evidence or procedure applicable to judicial or other proceedings.
SECTION 15.3
Presumption of Entitlement; Conclusive Effect of Findings of Fact and Law; Other Procedures.
The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Corporation irrespective of the determination as to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification.
SECTION 15.4
Cooperation and Expenses.
If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 15.5. If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, or if a quorum shall decline or fail to select Independent Counsel within five business days after having directed, pursuant to paragraph 5(b) of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification to be submitted to Independent Counsel, then Independent Counsel shall be selected by the law firm regularly or most frequently engaged by the Corporation during the preceding three years for representation or counseling in connection with general corporate matters. In any event, Independent Counsel shall be selected from among those Chicago, Illinois, or Delaware law firms having a significant and continuous practice in the field of corporate law but excluding any firm that: (i) has, within the preceding three years represented the Corporation, the Indemnitee or affiliates of either in any significant matter; (ii) has, within the preceding three years, represented any other party in any significant judicial or other proceeding against or in opposition to the
SECTION 15.5
Selection of Independent Counsel.
 
Corporation, the Indemnitee or any affiliate of either; (iii) had any involvement of any significant nature in or with respect to the claim for which indemnification is requested; or (iv) has any other material conflict of interest in being engaged as Independent Counsel.
The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made within 60 days after such Indemnitee shall have submitted all such additional information, if any, as shall have been reasonably requested during the 30-day period following the initial submission of the Indemnification Request to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that the claim with respect to which indemnification is requested is the subject of a judicial, government or other proceeding, the Board of Directors, stockholders or Independent Counsel, as the case may be, may defer their determination until 60 days after any such proceeding shall have been finally adjudicated or terminated (by settlement or otherwise) and all periods for appeal, rehearing or reinstitution of such proceeding (whether in a different forum or otherwise) have expired.
SECTION 15.6
Time for Determination.
If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall not be made within the period specified in these By-laws, unless due to a material failure of the Indemnitee to comply with his or her obligations under Section 15.4 hereof, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indemnification Request. The Indemnitee may only enforce his or her rights to indemnification, whether pursuant to a determination that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or pursuant to this Section 15.7, in any judicial proceeding brought, at the election of the Indemnitee, in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall then have its principal executive offices. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the successful enforcement of the Indemnitee's right to indemnification.
SECTION 15.7
Failure To Make Determination; Remedies For Enforcement.
In the event that a determination shall be made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, in whole or in part, the Indemnitee may only institute an action in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall have its principal executive offices to establish the Indemnitee's right to indemnification. Any such proceeding shall be conducted in all respects as a determination on the merits and any such prior determination made pursuant to these By-laws that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall not constitute a presumption that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.
SECTION 15.8
Appeal of Adverse Determination.
de novo
In any judicial proceeding regarding the Indemnitee's right or entitlement to indemnification or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that any Indemnitee who is a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses as the case may be, subject, however, to principles of and relating to prior judicial proceedings to which the Indemnitee is or was a party. In cases in which the Indemnitee is not a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee shall have the burden of proving he or she is entitled to indemnification or the advancement of expenses.
SECTION 15.9
Burden of Proof.
res judicata
collateral estoppel
 
A Disinterested Director shall mean any director who: (i) was not a party to the claim or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is requested; (ii) has not submitted an Indemnification Request or a request for advancement of expenses on his or her own behalf that has not been finally resolved; or (iii) does not have any direct and material financial or other personal interest in the determination of the Indemnification Request.

(b) The commencement by an entity, person, or group (other than the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation) of a tender offer or an exchange offer for more than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation;

(d) The election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the recommendation or approval of the incumbent Board of Directors of the Corporation, of the lesser of (i) three directors or (ii) directors constituting a majority of the number of directors of the Corporation then in office.
Expenses as may be incurred by a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in such Article Eighth. Such expenses as may be incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid on such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. For purposes of the foregoing, a determination that a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation shall be made in the manner hereinbefore provided for the determination of an Indemnification Request; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may initiate such determination

Exhibit 99.2
These Corporate Governance Guidelines (these "Guidelines") were adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") on November 14, 2006 and supersede the corporate governance guidelines adopted by the Board on April 18, 2006. These Guidelines are intended to comply with the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq").
A.
Composition of the Board of Directors
1. . In recent years, the Board has had between 12 and 16 members. A size in this range makes the Board large enough to allow for a diversity of perspectives and backgrounds without being so large as to impede effective discussion. The quality of the individuals serving and the overall balance of the Board are more important than the precise number of members. The Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews the size of the Board, and these considerations could lead the Corporate Governance Committee to recommend to the Board, from time to time, a Board outside this range.
Size
2. . A majority of the Board consists of "independent directors," as defined under Nasdaq rules. No director shall qualify as "independent" unless the Board affirmatively determines that the has no relationship with the Corporation which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and has no material relationship with the Corporation (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Corporation). To assist it in making determinations of independence, the Board may adopt, and disclose on its website, categorical standards. The Corporation will disclose, in its annual proxy statement, the names of those directors that the Board has determined to be independent under the Nasdaq rules and any categorical standards adopted by the Board and will describe, by specific category or type, for each director or nominee for director determined to be independent, any transactions, relationships or arrangements not disclosed in the proxy statement that were considered by the Board in making the determination. The Board would not expect to have more than two employee directors except in unusual circumstances, such as during a transition in leadership.
Independence
director
3. . No director may stand for election to the Board after his or her 72
Retirement
nd
birthday except in unusual circumstances approved by the Board. It is also expected that employee directors will resign from the Board at the time they resign or retire from the Corporation.
4. . A director who resigns or is terminated from the primary position that such director held when elected to the Board shall tender his or her resignation as a director to the Corporate Governance Committee, effective upon the Board's acceptance of the resignation. The Corporate Governance Committee will review the desirability of the director's continued service on the Board under the circumstances and will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether or not the Board should accept the resignation.
Change of Job Responsibility
5. . The Board as a whole is responsible for selecting candidates for director. The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for screening and recommending candidates. In discharging this responsibility, the Committee considers the nature of the expertise and experience required for the performance of the duties of a director of a corporation engaged in the Corporation's business and such matters as the relevant business and industry experience, professional background, age, current employment, community service and other board service of candidates for directors, as well as the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify, as candidates for director, persons with a for and record of integrity and good business judgment who (1) have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility and are leaders in the organizations with which they are affiliated, (2) are free from conflicts of interest that could interfere with a director's duties to the Corporation and its stockholders, and (3) are willing and able to make the necessary commitment of time and attention required for effective Board service. The Corporate Governance Committee also takes into account the candidate's level of financial literacy. The Corporate Governance Committee monitors the mix of skills and experience of the directors in order to assess whether the Board has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively.
Candidates
reputation
6. . Although the Corporate Governance Committee will consider length of service in recommending for re-election, the Board does not believe that adopting a set term limit for directors serves the interests of the Corporation.
Term Limits
candidates
7. . No may serve on the board of directors of more than four public companies, in addition to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee takes into account the competing demands on a person's time in deciding whether or not to recommend to the Board such person's nomination or renomination as a director.
Service on Other Boards
director
8. . The Board should remain free to configure leadership of the Board and the Corporation in the way that best serves Corporation's interests at the time and, accordingly, has no fixed policy with respect to combining or separating the offices of Chairman and CEO.
Leadership

9. . Director compensation should be set by the Board. The Compensation and Benefits Committee, with the assistance of the Corporation's staff, reviews the amount and composition of director compensation from time to time and makes recommendations to the Board when it changes are needed. In recommending director compensation, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considers the potential negative effect on director independence if director compensation and perquisites exceed customary levels.

B.
Effect of a Failure to Receive a Majority of the Votes In Director Elections
1. . In an uncontested election of directors (i.e., an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board), any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes present and voting at the meeting of stockholders will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board (or such other director designated by the Board if the director failing to receive the majority of votes cast is the Chairman of the Board) following of the stockholder vote. Such resignation shall be effective upon its acceptance by the Board.
Required Resignation
certification
 
2. . The Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the resignation submitted by an incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes, and the Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept the tendered resignation or reject it. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Corporate Governance Committee including, without limitation, any stated reasons stockholders did not support such director, the length of service and qualifications of the director whose resignation has been tendered, the director's contributions to the Corporation, and the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Consideration of Resignation
3. . The Board will act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting where the election occurred. In considering the Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board will consider the factors considered by the Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board believes to be relevant. Following the Board's decision on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose the Board's decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered (providing a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation) in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Board Action
Corporate
4. . To the extent that one or more directors' resignations are accepted by the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the Board.
Vacancies
5. . Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. If a majority of the members of the Corporate Governance Committee failed to receive a majority of the votes at the same , then the independent directors who are on the Board who did receive a majority of the votes (or who were not standing for election) will appoint a Board committee amongst themselves solely for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject them. This Board committee may, but need not, consist of all of the independent directors who received a majority of the votes or who were not standing for election.
Recusal of Certain Directors

Committees of the Board
1. . The Corporation will have at all times Audit, Corporate Governance, and Compensation and Benefits Committees. The Corporation also has Business Risk, Business Strategy, and Executive Committees. The responsibilities of each Committee and any membership requirements are contained in the Corporation's By-laws and a charter approved by the Board. The Corporation complies with all applicable Nasdaq rules and regulatory requirements concerning the membership of Board Committees, including those with respect to the independence of the directors who serve on those Committees. Employees of the Corporation do not serve on any of the Committees other than the Executive Committee, although the staff work needed for each Committee is coordinated by a designated officer of the Corporation. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Committee structure of the Board and the membership of the various Committees at least annually and makes recommendations for any changes to the Board.
Numbers and Composition of Committees
2. . The Board believes that Committee assignments should be based on the director's knowledge, interests and areas of expertise. The Chief Executive Officer will normally chair the Executive Committee. The Chairmanship of other Committees should change at intervals of approximately five years, and there should also be a regular rotation in the membership of the Committees, balancing in each case the need for fresh perspective with the need for experience and continuity.
Committee Chairmen and Membership
3. . The Committee Chairman, in consultation with the Committee members, determines the frequency of Committee meetings. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Committees on which they sit and to spend the time needed to discharge their responsibilities as members of those Committees. The agenda and any background materials for Committee meetings may be developed in consultation with Committee members, management, or the executive officer responsible for supporting the Committee and are circulated in advance of a meeting whenever practical. Committee members are expected to review these materials in advance of the meeting. The Committee Chairmen report to the Board after each meeting, and minutes of the Committees are circulated to the Board.

Evaluation of Senior Officers
2. . The Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews, and following Committee discussions, with and without the CEO, and the Committee's annual management development and succession planning review to which all of the Corporation's directors are invited, makes recommendations to the Board concerning management development and succession planning activities. The Corporate Governance Committee discusses succession planning in the event of the unexpected death, incapacity or resignation of the CEO and recommends to the Board, after consultation with the Chairman of the Corporation's Compensation and Benefits Committee, an appropriate successor under such circumstances.
Succession Planning

Continuing professional development opportunities for all other directors will be conducted through the Corporation's regular Board meetings and Board meeting materials; periodic Board or Board Committee presentations by the Corporation's officers concerning the Corporation's strategies, initiatives, business plans, management structure, compliance programs, and significant financial, accounting and risk management issues; Board or Board Committee presentations by outside parties concerning industry issues and other business, legal and regulatory matters; copies of periodic filings and significant presentations made to investors; attendance at the orientation program for new directors, if desired; and other professional development opportunities, if appropriate and relevant to the duties of a director of the Corporation, including presentations and programs offered by various outside organizations, with appropriate expenses paid by the Corporation.
