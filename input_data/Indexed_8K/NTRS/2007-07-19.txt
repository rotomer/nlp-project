On July 17, 2007, the Board of Directors of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") adopted an amendment to Article XI of the Corporation's By-laws. A copy of the By-laws of the Corporation, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The amendment to Article XI of the By-laws provides for the issuance and transfer of uncertificated shares. The amendment enables the Corporation to participate in the Direct Registration System (the "DRS"), as required by rules recently adopted by the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The DRS allows investors to have securities registered in their names without the issuance of physical certificates and further allows investors to transfer securities electronically to broker-dealers in order to effect transactions without the risks and delays associated with transferring physical certificates. The amendment to the By-laws also provides that each registered stockholder shall be entitled to a stock certificate upon written request to the transfer agent or registrar of the Corporation.
The amendment took effect upon adoption by the Board of Directors.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which meeting the stockholders shall elect directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
SECTION 1.1
Annual Meeting
special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President. At a special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors.
SECTION 1.2
Special Meetings. A
Unless a different manner of giving notice is prescribed by statute, written or printed notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not more than 50 days nor less than 10 days (or less than 20 days if a merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or assets, is to be acted upon at the meeting) before the date of the meeting either personally or by mail, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
SECTION 1.3
Notice of Meetings.
SECTION 1.4
Fixing Date of Record.
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days (or less than 20 days if a merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or assets, is to be acted upon at the meeting) before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business
 
on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to an adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered in the manner required by law to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the Corporation's stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(d) Only those who shall be stockholders of record on the record date so fixed as aforesaid shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after the applicable record date.
The Board of Directors or the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall appoint, in advance, one or more inspectors to act at each meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation. If no
SECTION 1.5
Inspectors of Elections.
 
inspector has been appointed or one or more have been appointed but are unable or fail to act, the presiding officer of any meeting of the stockholders shall appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares of stock of the Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting and the voting power of each share; determine and report the number of shares represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; and do such other acts as are required by law or are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the stockholders. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be evidence thereof. The inspector or inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in performing their duties.
prima facie
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the presiding officer at the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

Quorum.
In all uncontested elections of Directors of the Corporation (i.e., an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board), to be elected as a Director, a nominee for Director must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and voting at the meeting of Stockholders. In all contested elections of Directors of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes present and voting will be required to elect a Director.
SECTION 1.7
Majority Vote Required.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the foregoing sentence, a stockholder may validly grant such authority by (a) executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, (b) authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder, or (c) any other means permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
SECTION 1.10
Voting Lists.
The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the place of meeting for any annual meeting or any special meeting called by the Board of Directors.

SECTION 1.11
Place of Meeting.
Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the by-laws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may determine.
SECTION 1.12
Voting of Shares of Certain Holders.
Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or an incompetent person, may be voted by his or her administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator, either in person or by proxy without a transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator.

Shares of its own capital stock belonging to this Corporation shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time, but shares of its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.

Attendance of any person at a meeting for which any notice whatever is required to be given under the provisions of these By-laws, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
SECTION 14.1
Waiver of Notice
. A director, officer or other person (the "Indemnitee") who seeks indemnification (other than advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 15.12 hereof), in respect of amounts paid or owing as expenses, judgments, fines, or in settlement, shall submit a written request for indemnification (the "Indemnification Request") to the Board of Directors of the Corporation by delivering or mailing the same, registered or certified mail, to the Board of Directors c/o the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices. If mailed, the Indemnification Request shall be deemed made 48 hours after depositing the same in the United States mail addressed as aforesaid.
SECTION 15.1
Indemnification Request
 
. The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification as set forth in the Indemnification Request shall be made in the specific case, at the expense of the Corporation, as set forth in paragraph 5 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. However, in the event a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, such determination shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.
SECTION 15.2
Determination of Indemnification Request
. The termination with respect to the Indemnitee of any action, suit or proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the standard of conduct required by Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation for indemnification. If the Indemnitee is a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to have met the required standard of conduct but only to the extent not contrary to any final findings of fact or law made in any action, suit or proceeding to which the Indemnitee is or was a party and for which indemnification is requested. The person, persons or entity making the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be entitled to rely upon all such findings of fact and law made known to such person, persons or entity. Such person, persons or entity may consider such other matters as they or it deem appropriate, shall not be required to receive or hear evidence, oral presentations, briefs or other submission, shall not be required to hold hearings, and shall not otherwise be subject to any rules of evidence or procedure applicable to judicial or other proceedings.
SECTION 15.3
Presumption of Entitlement; Conclusive Effect of Findings of Fact and Law; Other Procedures
. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Corporation irrespective of the determination as to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification.
SECTION 15.4
Cooperation and Expenses
. If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 15.5. If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, or if a quorum shall decline or fail to select Independent Counsel within five business days after having directed, pursuant to paragraph 5(b) of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification to be submitted to Independent Counsel, then Independent Counsel shall be selected by the law firm regularly or most frequently engaged by the Corporation during the preceding three years for representation or counseling in connection with general corporate matters. In any event, Independent Counsel shall be
SECTION 15.5
Selection of Independent Counsel
 
selected from among those Chicago, Illinois, or Delaware law firms having a significant and continuous practice in the field of corporate law but excluding any firm that: (i) has, within the preceding three years represented the Corporation, the Indemnitee or affiliates of either in any significant matter; (ii) has, within the preceding three years, represented any other party in any significant judicial or other proceeding against or in opposition to the Corporation, the Indemnitee or any affiliate of either; (iii) had any involvement of any significant nature in or with respect to the claim for which indemnification is requested; or (iv) has any other material conflict of interest in being engaged as Independent Counsel.
. The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made within 60 days after such Indemnitee shall have submitted all such additional information, if any, as shall have been reasonably requested during the 30-day period following the initial submission of the Indemnification Request to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that the claim with respect to which indemnification is requested is the subject of a judicial, government or other proceeding, the Board of Directors, stockholders or Independent Counsel, as the case may be, may defer their determination until 60 days after any such proceeding shall have been finally adjudicated or terminated (by settlement or otherwise) and all periods for appeal, rehearing or reinstitution of such proceeding (whether in a different forum or otherwise) have expired.
SECTION 15.6
Time for Determination
. If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall not be made within the period specified in these By-laws, unless due to a material failure of the Indemnitee to comply with his or her obligations under Section 15.4 hereof, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indemnification Request. The Indemnitee may only enforce his or her rights to indemnification, whether pursuant to a determination that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or pursuant to this Section 15.7, in any judicial proceeding brought, at the election of the Indemnitee, in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall then have its principal executive offices. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the successful enforcement of the Indemnitee's right to indemnification.
SECTION 15.7
Failure To Make Determination; Remedies For Enforcement
. In the event that a determination shall be made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, in whole or in part, the Indemnitee may only institute an action in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall have its principal executive offices to establish the Indemnitee's right to indemnification. Any such proceeding shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo determination on the merits and any such prior determination made pursuant to these By-laws that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall not constitute a presumption that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.
SECTION 15.8
Appeal of Adverse Determination
. In any judicial proceeding regarding the Indemnitee's right or entitlement to indemnification or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that any Indemnitee who is a person referred to in
SECTION 15.9
Burden of Proof
 
paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses as the case may be, subject, however, to principles of and relating to prior judicial proceedings to which the Indemnitee is or was a party. In cases in which the Indemnitee is not a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee shall have the burden of proving he or she is entitled to indemnification or the advancement of expenses.
res judicata
collateral estoppel
