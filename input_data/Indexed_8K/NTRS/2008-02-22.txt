IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 

Exhibit 99
News Release
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Chicago, February 22, 2008) On February 21, 2008, Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") entered into Capital Support Agreements with certain Registered Investment Companies, Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities and other unregistered short-term investment pools (each, a "Fund" or, together, the "Funds"). Subsidiaries of the Corporation act as investment advisor to each of the Funds, and various clients of the Corporation and its subsidiaries are investors in the Funds.
Each Fund holds notes and other instruments (the "Covered Investments") issued by Whistlejacket Capital LLC or White Pine Finance LLC, which are structured investment vehicles. A structured investment vehicle issues commercial paper and other debt securities and uses the proceeds to purchase bonds or other long-term debt instruments that are used to collateralize the obligations of the vehicle. Whistlejacket Capital LLC and White Pine Finance LLC have recently been downgraded by rating agencies. Although it was not obligated to do so, the Corporation entered into the Capital Support Agreements in order to provide stability to the Funds and investors in the Funds.
 
Under each Capital Support Agreement, the Corporation has committed to provide capital in certain circumstances to the applicable Fund, subject to the maximum aggregate capital contribution limits set forth in the table below. Upon the sale or other disposition of a Covered Investment by a Fund, the amount of capital that the Corporation is required to contribute to that Fund would be the least of the following amounts: (i) the amount, if any, by which the amortized cost of the Covered Investment exceeds the amount realized from the sale or other disposition of the Covered Investment; (ii) the amount, if any, necessary to restore the net asset value per share of the Fund to a specified threshold amount (ranging from $0.995 to $0.9975 under the Capital Support Agreements); or (iii) the remaining amount of the aggregate capital contribution limit of the Capital Support Agreement applicable to the Fund, taking into account all prior contributions. Each Capital Support Agreement will expire no later than July 31, 2008.
In the event that the Corporation is required under a Capital Support Agreement to commit capital to any Fund, the Corporation will not receive any consideration from the Fund, in the form of shares of the Fund or any other form, for the contributed capital. As a result of entering into the Capital Support Agreements, the Corporation will record a nominal non-cash charge equal to the estimated fair value of the agreements. Estimates of fair value are highly judgmental and are dependent on various factors, including the value of the Covered Investments, Fund size, liquidity and general economic conditions in the fixed income market, and the remaining term of the agreements. Future changes in the estimated fair value of the agreements will be recorded in earnings in the period of the change. The total expense that will be recorded by the Corporation over the term of the agreements will equal the amount of total capital actually contributed to the Funds. The Corporation has not been required to make capital contributions to any Fund under a Capital Support Agreement or otherwise as of February 22, 2008.
 
Under the Capital Support Agreements, the maximum aggregate capital contribution that the Corporation could be required to provide with respect to each Fund, the aggregate net asset value of each Fund as of February 20, 2008 and the Covered Investments as a percentage of each Fund's aggregate net asset value as of February 20, 2008 are as follows:*
