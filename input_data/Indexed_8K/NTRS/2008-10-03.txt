Exhibit 10.1
THIS CAPITAL SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of September 29, 2008, by and between Northern Trust Corporation (the "Support Provider") and The Northern Trust Company ("TNT") as trustee on behalf of The Northern Trust Company Common Short Term Investment Fund (the "Fund").
WHEREAS, the Fund is a bank maintained common fund for which TNT is trustee that seeks to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per unit and to value the Fund's assets on an amortized cost rather than market value basis, all pursuant to the applicable regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency contained in 12 C.F.R. Section 9.18 ("OCC Regulations");
WHEREAS, the Fund holds Impaired Assets, as defined below;
WHEREAS, a sale of the Impaired Assets under current market conditions is unlikely to result in the full recovery of the Fund's investments, and may cause the Fund to realize losses to the extent that it could no longer maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per unit;
WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the Support Provider and certain of its affiliates for the Fund to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per unit;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Support Provider and TNT hereby agree as follows:
1. . In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Definitions
(a) "Amortized Cost Value" means, with respect to any Impaired Asset held by the Fund, the value of that Impaired Asset as determined using the amortized cost method ("Amortized Cost Method") in accordance with OCC Regulations on the relevant date.
(b) "Capital Contribution" means a cash contribution by the Support Provider to the Fund for which the Support Provider does not receive any units or other consideration from the Fund.
(c) "Contribution Event" means, with respect to any Impaired Asset held by the Fund, any of the following occurrences:
(i) Any sale of the Impaired Asset by the Fund for cash in an amount, after deduction of any commissions or similar transaction costs, less than the Amortized Cost Value of the Impaired Asset sold as of the date of settlement;
(ii) Receipt of final payment on the Impaired Asset in an amount less than the Amortized Cost Value of that Impaired Asset as of the date such payment is received; or
(iii) Issuance of orders by a court having jurisdiction over the matter discharging the issuer from liability for the Impaired Asset and providing for payments on that Impaired Asset in an amount less than the Amortized Cost Value of that Impaired Asset as of the date such payment is received.
The excess of the Amortized Cost Value of the Impaired Assets subject to a Contribution Event over the amount received by the Fund in connection with such Contribution Event shall constitute the "Loss" on such Impaired Assets.
(d) "Impaired Assets" means any security held in the Fund's portfolio as of the date of this Agreement where the market price for such security is or becomes below the Amortized Cost Value for such security by 0.001%.
(e) "Maximum Contribution Amount" means ten million dollars ($10,000,000). The Maximum Contribution Amount may be amended at any time as agreed by TNT and the Support Provider.
(f) "Required Capital Contribution" means for the Fund on the date of any Contribution Event, a Capital Contribution in an amount sufficient for the Fund to maintain its net asset value per unit at no less than the Minimum Permissible NAV, after giving effect to the Contribution Event and all payments received by the Fund in respect of the Impaired Assets. The net asset value for purposes of calculating the amount of Required Capital Contribution shall exclude any account receivable or other asset representing the Support Provider's obligations under this Agreement. Minimum Permissible NAV means the greater of (i) such minimum net asset value as determined by TNT will meet the requirements of the OCC Regulations with respect to valuation of the Fund pursuant to the Amortized Cost Method or (ii) $0.9990/unit.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to cause the delegation by TNT to any person any authority which is not permitted to be delegated under OCC Regulations.
(b) The Fund will retain any Capital Contribution and not include the Capital Contribution in any dividend or other distribution to the Fund's participants. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this subparagraph, the withdrawal of the Fund's units shall not constitute a "distribution" to Fund participants.
(c) The Fund will promptly sell the Impaired Assets upon the earlier of (i) any change in the Support Provider's short term credit ratings such that the Support Provider's obligations no longer qualify as First Tier Securities as defined in paragraph (a)(12) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (ii) on the business day immediately prior to the date set forth in subparagraph 3(c)(iii); provided, however, the Fund shall not have to sell the Impaired Assets, on such date, if TNT, on behalf of the Fund, determines it is in the best interests of the Fund's unitholders to maintain such Impaired Assets in the Fund and the
