On February 16, 2010, the Board of Directors of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") amended the Corporation's By-laws, effective February 16, 2010.
The By-law amendments provide that a majority of the Corporation's independent directors will annually designate one of the independent directors as Lead Director. The amendments also provide that, in the absence or inability to act of the Chairman of the Board, the Lead Director (or in the absence or inability to act of the Lead Director, a director or officer designated by the Corporation's independent directors) will preside at meetings of the stockholders and the Board of Directors and will have and exercise the powers and duties of the Chairman of the Board. Prior to the amendments, the By-laws provided that, in the absence or inability to act of the Chairman, the Chairman's duties would be performed by the President, a Vice Chairman or an Executive Vice President (in that order of succession).
The preceding description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Corporation's By-laws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Also on February 16, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted amendments to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines"). The amendments to the Guidelines, among other things, establish the position of Lead Director and set forth certain duties of the Lead Director.
The amended Guidelines supersede the Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on November 10, 2009. A copy of the Guidelines, as amended, is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which meeting the stockholders shall elect directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
SECTION 1.1
Annual Meeting.
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President. At a special meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors.
SECTION 1.2
Special Meetings.
Unless a different manner of giving notice is prescribed by statute, written or printed notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not more than 50 days nor less than 10 days (or less than 20 days if a merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or assets, is to be acted upon at the meeting) before the date of the meeting either personally or by mail, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
SECTION 1.3
Notice of Meetings.
SECTION 1.4
Fixing Date of Record.
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days (or less than 20 days if a merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property or assets, is to be acted upon at the meeting) before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the next day preceding the day on
which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to an adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered in the manner required by law to the Corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its principal place of business or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the Corporation's stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
(d) Only those who shall be stockholders of record on the record date so fixed as aforesaid shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding the transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after the applicable record date.
The Board of Directors or the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall appoint, in advance, one or more
SECTION 1.5
Inspectors of Elections.
 
inspectors to act at each meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation. If no inspector has been appointed or one or more have been appointed but are unable or fail to act, the presiding officer of any meeting of the stockholders shall appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares of stock of the Corporation outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting and the voting power of each share; determine and report the number of shares represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; and do such other acts as are required by law or are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the stockholders. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be evidence thereof. The inspector or inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in performing their duties.
prima facie
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the presiding officer at the meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
SECTION 1.6
Quorum.
In all uncontested elections of Directors of the Corporation (i.e., an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board), to be elected as a Director, a nominee for Director must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and voting at the meeting of Stockholders. In all contested elections of Directors of the Corporation, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes present and voting will be required to elect a Director.
SECTION 1.7
Majority Vote Required.
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy pursuant to the foregoing sentence, a stockholder may validly grant such authority by (a) executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, (b) authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or
SECTION 1.8

other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder, or (c) any other means permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Voting in any election for Directors shall be by ballot.

Voting by Ballot.
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
SECTION 1.10
Voting Lists.
The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the place of meeting for any annual meeting or any special meeting called by the Board of Directors. If no designation is made, or if a special meeting is otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation in the City of Chicago.
SECTION 1.11
Place of Meeting.
Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the by-laws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors of such corporation may determine.
SECTION 1.12
Voting of Shares of Certain Holders.
Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or an incompetent person, may be voted by his or her administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator, either in person or by proxy without a transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, court appointed guardian or conservator. Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person or by proxy.
Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver's name if authority so to do be contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.
A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
Shares of its own capital stock belonging to this Corporation shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time, but shares of its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity
 
may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.
No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 1.13 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.13.

SECTION 13.1
Seal.
. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given under the provisions of these By-laws or under the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance of any person at a meeting for which any notice whatever is required to be given under the provisions of these By-laws, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
SECTION 14.1
Waiver of Notice
A director, officer or other person (the "Indemnitee") who seeks indemnification (other than advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 15.12 hereof), in respect of amounts paid or owing as expenses, judgments, fines, or in settlement, shall submit a written request for indemnification (the "Indemnification Request") to the Board of Directors of the Corporation by delivering or mailing the same, registered or certified mail, to the Board of Directors c/o the Secretary of the Corporation at the Corporation's principal executive offices. If mailed, the Indemnification Request shall be deemed made 48 hours after depositing the same in the United States mail addressed as aforesaid.
SECTION 15.1
Indemnification Request.
The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification as set forth in the Indemnification Request shall be made in the specific case, at the expense of the Corporation, as set forth in paragraph 5 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. However, in the event a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred, such determination shall be made by Independent
SECTION 15.2
Determination of Indemnification Request.
 
Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee.
The termination with respect to the Indemnitee of any action, suit or proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not of itself adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the standard of conduct required by Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation for indemnification. If the Indemnitee is a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to have met the required standard of conduct but only to the extent not contrary to any final findings of fact or law made in any action, suit or proceeding to which the Indemnitee is or was a party and for which indemnification is requested. The person, persons or entity making the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be entitled to rely upon all such findings of fact and law made known to such person, persons or entity. Such person, persons or entity may consider such other matters as they or it deem appropriate, shall not be required to receive or hear evidence, oral presentations, briefs or other submission, shall not be required to hold hearings, and shall not otherwise be subject to any rules of evidence or procedure applicable to judicial or other proceedings.
SECTION 15.3
Presumption of Entitlement; Conclusive Effect of Findings of Fact and Law; Other Procedures.
nolo contendere
The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Corporation irrespective of the determination as to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification.
SECTION 15.4
Cooperation and Expenses.
If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 15.5. If a Change of Control shall not have occurred, Independent Counsel shall be selected by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors. If a Change of Control shall have occurred, or if a quorum shall decline or fail to select Independent Counsel within five business days after having directed, pursuant to paragraph 5(b) of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification to be submitted to Independent Counsel, then Independent Counsel shall be selected by the law firm regularly or most frequently engaged by the Corporation during the preceding three years for representation or counseling in connection with general corporate matters. In any event, Independent Counsel shall be selected from among those Chicago, Illinois, or Delaware law firms having a significant and continuous practice in the field of corporate law but excluding any firm that: (i) has, within the preceding three years represented the Corporation, the Indemnitee or affiliates of either in any significant matter; (ii) has, within the preceding three years, represented any other party in any significant judicial or other proceeding against or in opposition to the
SECTION 15.5
Selection of Independent Counsel.
 
Corporation, the Indemnitee or any affiliate of either; (iii) had any involvement of any significant nature in or with respect to the claim for which indemnification is requested; or (iv) has any other material conflict of interest in being engaged as Independent Counsel.
The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made within 60 days after such Indemnitee shall have submitted all such additional information, if any, as shall have been reasonably requested during the 30-day period following the initial submission of the Indemnification Request to the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof. The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event that the claim with respect to which indemnification is requested is the subject of a judicial, government or other proceeding, the Board of Directors, stockholders or Independent Counsel, as the case may be, may defer their determination until 60 days after any such proceeding shall have been finally adjudicated or terminated (by settlement or otherwise) and all periods for appeal, rehearing or reinstitution of such proceeding (whether in a different forum or otherwise) have expired.
SECTION 15.6
Time for Determination.
If a determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall not be made within the period specified in these By-laws, unless due to a material failure of the Indemnitee to comply with his or her obligations under Section 15.4 hereof, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indemnification Request. The Indemnitee may only enforce his or her rights to indemnification, whether pursuant to a determination that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or pursuant to this Section 15.7, in any judicial proceeding brought, at the election of the Indemnitee, in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall then have its principal executive offices. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the successful enforcement of the Indemnitee's right to indemnification.
SECTION 15.7
Failure To Make Determination; Remedies For Enforcement.
In the event that a determination shall be made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, in whole or in part, the Indemnitee may only institute an action in any court having jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, or the state in which the Corporation shall have its principal executive offices to establish the Indemnitee's right to indemnification. Any such proceeding shall be conducted in all respects as a determination on the merits and any such prior determination made pursuant to these By-laws that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall not constitute a presumption that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.
SECTION 15.8
Appeal of Adverse Determination.
de novo
In any judicial proceeding regarding the Indemnitee's right or entitlement to indemnification or advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that any Indemnitee who is a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses as the case may be, subject, however, to principles of and relating to prior judicial proceedings to which the Indemnitee is or was a party. In cases in which the Indemnitee is not a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Indemnitee
SECTION 15.9
Burden of Proof.
res judicata
collateral estoppel
 
shall have the burden of proving he or she is entitled to indemnification or the advancement of expenses.
A Disinterested Director shall mean any director who: (i) was not a party to the claim or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is requested; (ii) has not submitted an Indemnification Request or a request for advancement of expenses on his or her own behalf that has not been finally resolved; or (iii) does not have any direct and material financial or other personal interest in the determination of the Indemnification Request.
SECTION 15.10
Definition of "Disinterested Director."
A Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred on the earliest of:
SECTION 15.11
Definition of "Change of Control."
(a) The receipt by the Corporation of a Schedule 13D or other statement filed under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, indicating that any entity, person, or group has acquired beneficial ownership, as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of more than 30% of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors ("voting stock");
(b) The commencement by an entity, person, or group (other than the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation) of a tender offer or an exchange offer for more than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation;
(c) The effective time of (i) a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with one or more other corporations as a result of which the holders of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation immediately prior to such merger or consolidation hold less than 80% of the voting stock of the surviving or resulting corporation, or (ii) a transfer of substantially all of the property of the Corporation other than to an entity of which the Corporation owns at least 80% of the voting stock; or
(d) The election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without the recommendation or approval of the incumbent Board of Directors of the Corporation, of the lesser of (i) three directors or (ii) directors constituting a majority of the number of directors of the Corporation then in office.
Expenses as may be incurred by a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in such Article Eighth. Such expenses as may be incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid on such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. For purposes of the foregoing, a determination that a person referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of Article Eighth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation shall be made in the manner hereinbefore provided for the determination of an Indemnification Request; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may initiate such determination
SECTION 15.12
Advancement of Expenses.
 
whenever it shall deem the same to be appropriate. In connection with such determination, such person shall be subject to all requirements of these By-laws imposed on an "Indemnitee" in respect of a determination made pursuant to Section 15.2 hereof.
No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses for any determination, act or omission in connection therewith.
SECTION 15.13
Personal Liability of Directors.
These By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed and new By-laws may be adopted at any meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board. These By-laws may also be amended or repealed, or new By-laws may be adopted, by action taken by the stockholders of the Corporation.
SECTION 16.1
Amendments.
 

Exhibit 99.1
These Corporate Governance Guidelines (these "Guidelines") were adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") on February 16, 2010 and supersede the corporate governance guidelines adopted by the Board on October 20, 2009. These Guidelines are intended to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities.
 
1. . In recent years, the Board has had between 12 and 16 members. A size in this range makes the Board large enough to allow for a diversity of perspectives and backgrounds without being so large as to impede effective discussion. The quality of the individuals serving and the overall balance of the Board are more important than the precise number of members. The Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews the size of the Board, and these considerations could lead the Corporate Governance Committee to recommend to the Board, from time to time, a Board outside this range but within the range provided for in the Corporation's By-laws.
Size
2. . A majority of the Board shall be independent directors ("Independent Directors") as defined under the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"). No director shall qualify as an Independent Director unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no relationship with the Corporation which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and has no material relationship with the Corporation (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Corporation). To assist it in making determinations of independence, the Board may adopt, and disclose on its website, categorical standards. The Corporation will disclose, in its annual proxy statement, the names of those directors that the Board has determined to be independent under the NASDAQ listing standards and any categorical standards adopted by the Board and will describe, by specific category or type, for each director or nominee for director determined to be independent, any transactions, relationships or arrangements not disclosed in the proxy statement that were considered by the Board in making the determination. The Board would not expect to have more than two employee directors except in unusual circumstances, such as during a transition in leadership.
Independence
3. . The Corporation's Independent Directors shall designate annually one of the Independent Directors to serve as the Lead Director (the "Lead Director"). The Lead Director's duties shall include (i) agreeing annually with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") on the number and length of regular Board meetings to assure sufficient time is scheduled for presentation and discussion; (ii) the authority to call at any time a special meeting of the Board or a special executive session of the Independent Directors; (iii) the authority to add items to the agenda of any regular or special meeting of the Board; (iv) preparing the agenda for
Lead Director
all regular and any special executive sessions of the Independent Directors; (v) presiding at all regular and special meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present; (vi) presiding at all regular and any special executive sessions of the Independent Directors; (vii) conducting, by means of an interview with each Independent Director, the Independent Directors' annual evaluation of the Chairman and CEO's performance and then communicating the results to the Compensation and Benefits Committee and to the Chairman and CEO; and (viii) conducting, by means of an interview with each director, including the Chairman and CEO, the Board's annual self-evaluation of its performance and then providing a summary report to the Board.
4. . No director may stand for election to the Board after his or her 72
Retirement
nd
birthday except in unusual circumstances approved by the Board. It is also expected that employee directors will resign from the Board at the time they resign or retire from the Corporation.
5. . A director who resigns or is terminated from the primary position that such director held when elected to the Board shall tender his or her resignation as a director to the Corporate Governance Committee, effective upon the Board's acceptance of the resignation. The Corporate Governance Committee will review the desirability of the director's continued service on the Board under the circumstances and will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether or not the Board should accept the resignation.
Change of Job Responsibility
6. . The Board as a whole is responsible for selecting candidates for director. The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for screening and recommending candidates. In discharging this responsibility, the Committee considers the nature of the expertise and experience required for the performance of the duties of a director of a corporation engaged in the Corporation's business and such matters as the relevant business and industry experience, professional background, age, current employment, community service and other board service of candidates for directors, as well as the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify, as candidates for director, persons with a reputation for and record of integrity and good business judgment who (1) have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility and are leaders in the organizations with which they are affiliated, (2) are free from conflicts of interest that could interfere with a director's duties to the Corporation and its stockholders, and (3) are willing and able to make the necessary commitment of time and attention required for effective Board service. The Corporate Governance Committee also takes into account the candidate's level of financial literacy. The Corporate Governance Committee monitors the mix of skills and experience of the directors in order to assess whether the Board has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively.
Candidates
7. . Although the Corporate Governance Committee will consider length of service in recommending candidates for re-election, the Board does not believe that adopting a set term limit for directors serves the interests of the Corporation.
Term Limits
8. . No director may serve on the board of directors of more than four public companies, in addition to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee takes into account the competing demands on a person's time in deciding whether or not to recommend to the Board such person's nomination or renomination as a director.
Service on Other Boards
 
9. . The Board should remain free to configure leadership of the Board and the Corporation in the way that best serves the Corporation's interests at the time and, accordingly, has no fixed policy with respect to combining or separating the offices of Chairman and CEO.
Leadership
10. . Director compensation should be set by the Board. The Compensation and Benefits Committee, with the assistance of the Corporation's staff, reviews the amount and composition of director compensation from time to time and makes recommendations to the Board when it concludes changes are needed. In recommending director compensation, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considers the potential negative effect on director independence if director compensation and perquisites exceed customary levels.
Compensation
11. . The Board may, from time to time, by majority vote, appoint up to three advisory directors to serve until the Board meeting following the next annual meeting of stockholders or until such advisory director's earlier resignation or termination by a majority of the Board. Advisory Directors may be invited to meetings of the Board or any committees of the Board and, if present, may participate in the discussions occurring at such meetings. Advisory Directors also may be appointed as Advisory Directors to one or more committees of the Board, as determined by the Board's Corporate Governance Committee. Advisory Directors shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum of the Board or a committee of the Board is present and shall not have any of a director's rights, powers or privileges, including the right to vote at such meetings. Advisory Directors will be entitled to receive fees for such service in such form and amount as recommended by the Compensation and Benefits Committee and approved by the Board, and shall be reimbursed for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket business expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the Board and its committees. Advisory Directors shall be subject to all of the Corporation's policies applicable to directors, including the Corporation's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. References in the Corporation's By-laws to "Directors" shall not include Advisory Directors.
Advisory Directors
 
1. . In an uncontested election of directors (i.e., an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board), any incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes present and voting at the meeting of stockholders will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board (or such other director designated by the Board if the director failing to receive the majority of votes cast is the Chairman of the Board) following certification of the stockholder vote. Such resignation shall be effective upon its acceptance by the Board.
Required Resignation
2. . The Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the resignation submitted by an incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes, and the Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept the tendered resignation or reject it. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Corporate Governance Committee including, without limitation, any stated reasons stockholders did not support such director, the length of service and
Consideration of Resignation
 
qualifications of the director whose resignation has been tendered, the director's contributions to the Corporation, and these Guidelines.
3. . The Board will act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting where the election occurred. In considering the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board will consider the factors considered by the Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board believes to be relevant. Following the Board's decision on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose the Board's decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered (providing a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation) in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Board Action
4. . To the extent that one or more directors' resignations are accepted by the Board, the Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the Board.
Vacancies
5. . Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation.

This Board committee may, but need not, consist of all of the Independent Directors who received a majority of the votes or who were not standing for election.

2. . Directors shall be entitled to indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law and by the Corporation's charter and By-laws and to exculpation as provided by state law and by the Corporation's charter.

4. . Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and to spend the time needed to discharge their responsibilities as directors. Materials with respect to matters on which action is expected to be taken are circulated to the Board at least several days in advance of the meeting whenever possible, and directors are expected to review these materials in advance of the meeting. Financial reports, certain Committee minutes and other background materials are also circulated in advance of the meeting and during months when the Board is not scheduled to meet.
Meeting Attendance and Preparation
5. . Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of the Corporation's stockholders.
Attendance at Annual Meeting of Stockholders
6. . The Independent Directors shall meet, without management, at regularly scheduled executive sessions which may take place before or after a regularly scheduled meeting of the full board. Such regularly scheduled executive sessions shall be held at least twice a year. The Lead Director also may call a special executive session of the Independent Directors at any time. Such special executive sessions may take place before or after a regular or special meeting of the full board or at such other time as the Lead Director deems appropriate. The Lead Director or, in his or her absence, another Independent Director designated by the Board, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors, shall preside at the executive sessions.
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors
7. . The Corporation discloses, in its annual proxy statement and on its website, one or more methods by which stockholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board of Directors, including the Lead Director, who presides over executive sessions of the Independent Directors, and the Independent Directors as a group.

8. . The Board expects that senior officers of the Corporation will regularly attend Board and Committee meetings, present proposals and otherwise assist in the work of the Board. Members of the Board have direct access to any of the Corporation's employees.
Access to Employees

Authority to Engage Advisors
 
1. . The Corporation will have at all times Audit, Corporate Governance, and Compensation and Benefits Committees. The Corporation also has Business Risk, Business Strategy, and Executive Committees. The responsibilities of each Committee and any membership requirements are contained in the Corporation's By-laws and a charter approved by the Board. The Corporation complies with all applicable NASDAQ
Numbers and Composition of Committees
 
listing standards and regulatory requirements concerning the membership of Board Committees, including those with respect to the independence of the directors who serve on those Committees. Employees of the Corporation do not serve on any of the Committees other than the Executive Committee, although the staff work needed for each Committee is coordinated by a designated officer of the Corporation. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Committee structure of the Board and the membership of the various Committees at least annually and makes recommendations for any changes to the Board.
2. . The Board believes that Committee assignments should be based on the director's knowledge, interests and areas of expertise. The Chairman of the Board will normally chair the Executive Committee. The Chairmanship of other Committees should change at intervals of approximately five years, and there should also be a regular rotation in the membership of the Committees, balancing in each case the need for fresh perspective with the need for experience and continuity.
Committee Chairmen and Membership
3. . The Committee Chairman, in consultation with the Committee members, determines the frequency of Committee meetings. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Committees on which they sit and to spend the time needed to discharge their responsibilities as members of those Committees. The agenda and any background materials for Committee meetings may be developed in consultation with Committee members, management, or the executive officer responsible for supporting the Committee and are circulated in advance of a meeting whenever practical. Committee members are expected to review these materials in advance of the meeting. The Committee Chairmen report to the Board after each meeting, and minutes of the Committees are circulated to the Board.
Committee Meeting Procedures
 
1. . A key responsibility of the Board is to monitor the performance of the CEO and, in consultation with the CEO, the performance of other senior officers. The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually conducts a formal management development and succession planning review, to which all of the Corporation's directors are invited, and reports to the Board.
Evaluation of Senior Officers
2. . The Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board concerning management development and succession planning activities, which recommendations are made following Committee discussions, with and without the CEO, and the Committee's annual management development and succession planning review to which all of the Corporation's directors are invited. The Corporate Governance Committee discusses succession planning in the event of the unexpected death, incapacity or resignation of the CEO and recommends to the Board, after consultation with the Chairman of the Corporation's Compensation and Benefits Committee, an appropriate successor under such circumstances.
Succession Planning
3. . Management speaks for the Corporation. Inquiries from institutional investors, the press and others should be referred to the CEO or other appropriate officers.
Communication
 
All new directors are required to participate in an orientation program, which is generally conducted within four months of each annual meeting at which new directors are elected. The orientation program includes the introduction of the new directors to the Corporation's principal officers and presentations by senior management to familiarize new directors with the Corporation's strategic plans and business units and generally includes a visit to the Corporation's headquarters. Continuing professional development opportunities for all other directors will be conducted through the Corporation's regular Board meetings and Board meeting materials; periodic Board or Board Committee presentations by the Corporation's officers concerning the Corporation's strategies, initiatives, business plans, management structure, compliance programs, and significant financial, accounting and risk management issues; Board or Board Committee presentations by outside parties concerning industry issues and other business, legal and regulatory matters; copies of periodic filings and significant presentations made to investors; attendance at the orientation program for new directors, if desired; and other professional development opportunities, if appropriate and relevant to the duties of a director of the Corporation, including presentations and programs offered by various outside organizations, with appropriate expenses paid by the Corporation.
 
The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board reviews and reassesses these Guidelines periodically and submits any recommended changes to the Board for its approval.
 
The Corporate Governance Committee leads the Board in an annual self-evaluation to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively and in compliance with these Guidelines. Such evaluation includes a review and assessment of the continuing independence of the Board's non-management directors. The Corporate Governance Committee solicits comments from all of the directors and reports annually to the Board on its assessment of the Board's performance and its recommendations for improvement. All directors are encouraged to make suggestions at any time for the improvement of the Board's practices.
