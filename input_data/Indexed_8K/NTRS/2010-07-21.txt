FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Chicago, July 21, 2010) Northern Trust Corporation today reported second quarter net income per common share of $.82, compared with net income per common share of $.64 in the first quarter of 2010 and $.95 per common share in the second quarter of 2009. Net income was $199.6 million in the current quarter, compared with net income of $157.2 million in the first quarter and $314.2 million in the prior year's second quarter. Return on average common equity was 12.2% in the current quarter, compared to 9.9% in the first quarter and 15.5% in the prior year's second quarter.
Earnings per share in the prior year quarter were reduced by $.37 in connection with Northern Trust's participation in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program (Capital Purchase Program). The prior year quarter also included a $130.1 million pre-tax expense reduction ($85.7 million after-tax, or $.36 per common share) in connection with Capital Support Agreements (CSAs) that had been established to support certain Northern Trust investment vehicles.
 
 
Frederick H. Waddell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased to report $200 million in net income in the second quarter despite the low interest rate environment and prolonged economic recovery. Our client-focused businesses continue to serve both new and existing clients with distinction and with a broad range of financial solutions. As one of the best capitalized large banks in the U.S., with Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Common ratios of 13.7% and 13.2%, respectively, we continue to invest in our businesses in order to serve our clients now and into the future. We are confident that ongoing economic challenges will ultimately give way to a recovery, benefiting our clients, our people and our shareholders."
 
 
Northern Trust's second quarter net income totaled $199.6 million, or $.82 per common share. Operating earnings, which exclude a $12.7 million pre-tax benefit ($8.0 million after tax, or $.04 per common share) from the reduction of an indemnification liability related to Visa, Inc. (Visa), were $191.6 million, or $.78 per common share, for the quarter. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is included on page 12.
Consolidated revenues totaled $973.8 million, down 7% from $1.05 billion in the prior year's second quarter. Noninterest income decreased 7% to $731.4 million and represented 75% of revenues. Trust, investment and other servicing fees declined by $57.9 million, or 10%, to $543.5 million. The decrease primarily reflects reduced securities lending revenue due to a lower level of asset valuation loss recoveries, and a higher level of waived fees in money market mutual funds. Trust, investment and other servicing fees accounted for 56% of second quarter revenues.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $316.0 million, primarily reflecting a decline in securities lending revenue, partially offset by higher custody, fund administration and investment management fees. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased 15% to $161.9 million, reflecting improved markets and new business. C&IS investment management fees for the second quarter of 2010 equaled $69.4 million, up 14% from the prior year quarter. The increase primarily reflects improved markets and new business, partially offset by waived fees in money market mutual funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS totaled $2.6 million in the current quarter compared with $.3 million in the prior year quarter. Securities lending fees totaled $66.3 million compared with $172.5 million in the second quarter of last year. The current quarter includes the recovery of previously recorded unrealized asset valuation losses of approximately $37 million in a mark-to-market investment fund used in securities lending activities, as
 
 
 
compared to recoveries of approximately $129 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of asset valuation recoveries, the decrease in securities lending fees of approximately $14 million is attributable to significantly lower spreads on the investment of cash collateral, while volumes improved from the prior year quarter's levels.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) totaled $227.5 million in the current quarter, increasing 8% from $210.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in PFS fees was primarily a result of improved markets and new business. Waived fees in money market mutual funds were $12.9 million in the current quarter compared with $3.6 million in the prior year quarter and are attributable to the low level of short-term interest rates.
 
C&IS assets under custody totaled $3.2 trillion, up 11% from a year ago, and included $1.8 trillion of global custody assets, 15% higher than a year ago. C&IS assets under management totaled $461.5 billion, up 9% from a year ago, and included $110.1 billion of securities lending related collateral, a 9% increase from the prior year quarter.
Foreign exchange trading income totaled $115.4 million compared with $134.3 million in the prior year quarter. The 14% decrease reflects reduced levels of market volatility as compared to last year's second quarter, partially offset by increased volume in the current quarter.
 
 
 
Other operating income equaled $37.4 million, up $9.2 million, or 33%, compared with $28.2 million in the same period last year. The prior year quarter was impacted by adverse mark-to-market adjustments of $4.8 million recorded on certain credit default swap contracts with outside counterparties used to mitigate credit risk associated with specific commercial credits. The current quarter reflects increases in commercial loan-related and banking services fee revenues totaling $3.4 million.
Net investment security losses totaled $.1 million in the current quarter. Net investment security losses in the prior year quarter totaled $17.5 million and included an $18.0 million pre-tax charge for the credit-related other-than-temporary impairment of residential mortgage backed securities.
Net interest income for the quarter, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $242.4 million, down 7% from $260.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease reflects the continued impact of the current low interest rate environment. The net interest margin was 1.47% for the current quarter, down from 1.59% in the prior year quarter. Average earning assets of $66.1 billion were 1% higher than a year ago, due to higher average securities balances, partially offset by decreases in average loans and leases.
The provision for credit losses was $50.0 million in the current quarter and net charge-offs totaled $38.3 million. This compares to a provision of $60.0 million and net charge-offs of $44.7 million recorded in the prior year quarter. The current quarter provision and charge-offs reflect the prolonged weakness in the broader economic environment.

Noninterest expenses totaled $614.4 million for the current quarter, up $111.7 million, or 22%, from $502.7 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included a $12.7 million benefit from a reduction of a Visa indemnification liability. The prior year quarter included a $130.1 million expense reduction in connection with CSAs that had been established to support certain Northern Trust investment vehicles and a $20.2 million Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance premium special assessment.

Compensation and employee benefit expenses, the largest component of noninterest expenses, decreased $12.8 million, or 4%, to $337.0 million. The primary driver of the decrease was a reduction in salaries and benefits reflecting lower average salaries and employee benefit expense per full-time staff equivalent basis. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at June 30, 2010 totaled approximately 12,600, up 2% from a year ago.
 
 
 
Expenses associated with outside services totaled $114.6 million, up $12.5 million, or 12%, from $102.1 million last year due to higher expenses associated with investment manager sub-advisory fees and technical services.

The increase primarily reflects higher levels of depreciation expense from additional investments in capital assets.

Other operating expenses totaled $63.8 million as compared to a negative expense of $50.8 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included the $130.1 million expense reduction in connection with CSAs, offset by the $20.2 million special assessment for FDIC insurance premiums.

C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees were up $18.7 million, or 6%. The increase in C&IS fees reflects higher securities lending revenue, which totaled $66.3 million in the current quarter compared with $55.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. The current quarter securities lending revenue includes the recovery of previously recorded unrealized asset valuation losses of approximately $37 million relating to a mark-to-market investment fund used in our securities lending activities compared to recoveries of approximately $38 million in the first quarter of 2010. Custody and fund administration fees increased $2.7 million to $161.9 million from the first quarter's $159.2 million. C&IS investment management fees in the current quarter increased 9% to $69.4 million from $63.7 million in the prior quarter, reflecting improved markets.

PFS trust, investment and other servicing fees were higher by $9.7 million, or 4%. The increase in PFS fees primarily reflects improved markets and new business. Waived fees in money market mutual funds were $12.9 million in the second quarter compared with $16.0 million in the prior quarter and are attributable to the low level of short-term interest rates.
Foreign exchange trading income increased $35.7 million, or 45%, to $115.4 million, reflecting improved currency volatility and volumes when compared to the first quarter.
