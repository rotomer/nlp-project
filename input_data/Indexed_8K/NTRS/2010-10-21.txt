FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Chicago, October 21, 2010) Northern Trust Corporation today reported third quarter net income per common share of $.64, compared with net income per common share of $.77 in the third quarter of 2009 and $.82 per common share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income was $155.6 million in the current quarter, compared with net income of $187.9 million in the prior year's third quarter and $199.6 million in the second quarter of 2010. Return on average common equity was 9.2% in the current quarter, compared to 11.9% in the prior year's third quarter and 12.2% in the second quarter.
Earnings per share in the third quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010 each benefited from reductions of an indemnification liability related to Visa, Inc. (Visa). The associated pre-tax expense reductions totaled $17.8 million ($11.2 million after tax, or $.05 per common share) in the third quarter of 2009 and $12.7 million ($8.0 million after tax, or $0.04 per common share) in the second quarter of 2010.
Frederick H. Waddell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Although the economic environment continues to be challenging, we are pleased that assets under custody increased by 10% to $3.9 trillion and assets under management increased 8% to $657.2 billion as compared to a year ago, reflecting continued business growth. Northern Trust has maintained its strong capital levels, and we remain confident in our competitive position and focused strategy."
 
 
Net income per common share in the third quarter of 2010 was $.64 as compared to $.77 per common share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the current quarter was $155.6 million compared to $187.9 million in the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings for the prior year quarter, which exclude the Visa related pre-tax benefit of $17.8 million, were $176.7 million, or $.72 per common share. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is included on page 11.
Consolidated revenues totaled $899.0 million, down 3% from $927.6 million in the prior year's third quarter. Noninterest income decreased 3% to $656.0 million and represented 73% of revenues. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $518.7 million, down 1% from $523.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to reduced securities lending revenue. Trust, investment and other servicing fees accounted for 58% of third quarter revenues.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) decreased 5% from the year-ago quarter to $293.2 million, primarily reflecting the decline in securities lending revenue, partially offset by higher fund administration fees. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased 6% to $159.2 million, reflecting new business and improved markets. C&IS investment management fees for the third quarter of 2010 equaled $60.7 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter's $61.0 million. Custody and fund administration fees were increased and investment management fees were decreased by $4.3 million each as a result of a fee reclassification. Investment management fees benefited from the improved markets and new business, offset by waived fees in money market mutual funds due to the persistent low level of short-term interest rates. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS totaled $2.5 million in the current quarter compared with $.8 million in the prior year quarter. Securities lending revenue totaled $56.4 million compared with $82.0 million in the third quarter of last year. The current quarter includes
 
 
 
 
the recovery of previously recorded unrealized asset valuation losses of approximately $39 million in a mark-to-market investment fund used in securities lending activities, as compared to recoveries of approximately $57 million in the prior year quarter. As of September 30, 2010, securities in the mark-to-market fund had been sold with the proceeds reinvested into a short duration fund, eliminating the mark-to-market impact on securities lending revenue in future periods. Excluding the current and prior year quarter impact of asset valuation recoveries, the decrease in securities lending revenue of approximately $8 million is attributable to lower spreads on the investment of cash collateral, while volumes improved from the prior year quarter's levels.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) totaled $225.5 million in the current quarter, increasing 6% from $212.9 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in PFS fees was primarily the result of new business and improved markets, partially offset by waived fees in money market mutual funds which totaled $10.4 million in the current quarter, compared with $8.1 million in the prior year quarter, and are attributable to the continued low level of short-term interest rates.
 
C&IS assets under custody totaled $3.6 trillion, up 10% from a year ago, and included $2.1 trillion of global custody assets, 13% higher than a year ago. C&IS assets under management totaled $508.6 billion, up 8% from a year ago, and included $111.7 billion of securities lending collateral, a 1% increase from the prior year quarter.
 
 
 
 
Foreign exchange trading income totaled $88.9 million, down 4% compared with $92.9 million in the prior year quarter.
Other operating income equaled $27.7 million, down $7.4 million, or 21%, compared with $35.1 million in the same period last year. The current quarter decrease primarily reflects a $6.3 million loss resulting from the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges.
Net investment security losses totaled $13.5 million in the current quarter as compared to $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. The current and prior year quarters included pre-tax charges of $14.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the credit-related other-than-temporary impairment of residential mortgage backed securities.
Net interest income for the quarter, stated on a fully taxable equivalent basis, totaled $243.0 million, down 2% from $248.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease reflects the continued impact of the current low interest rate environment. The net interest margin was 1.44% for the current quarter, down from 1.54% in the prior year quarter. Average earning assets of $67.0 billion were 4% higher than a year ago reflecting higher average securities balances and money market assets, partially offset by decreased average loans and leases.
The provision for credit losses was $30.0 million in the current quarter and net charge-offs totaled $30.3 million. This compares to a provision of $60.0 million and net charge-offs of $46.1 million recorded in the prior year quarter. The provision and charge-off levels, though reduced from the prior year quarter's levels, continue to reflect the prolonged weakness in the broader economic environment.
 
 
 
 
The table below provides information regarding nonperforming assets, the reserve for credit losses, and associated ratios.
 
Noninterest expenses totaled $622.1 million for the current quarter, up $22.9 million, or 4%, from $599.2 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the prior year quarter's $17.8 million pre-tax benefit from the reduction of the Visa indemnification liability, noninterest expenses in the current quarter increased by $5.1 million, or 1%.
Compensation and employee benefit expenses, the largest component of noninterest expenses, decreased $9.9 million, or 3%, to $333.3 million as compared to $343.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower share-based compensation. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at September 30, 2010 totaled approximately 12,700, up 2% from a year ago.
Expenses associated with outside services totaled $110.7 million, up $2.0 million, or 2%, from $108.7 million last year due to higher expenses associated with investment manager sub-advisory fees and technical services.
 
 
 
 
Equipment and software expense totaled $72.6 million, up 11% from $65.6 million in the prior year quarter due to higher levels of depreciation expense from additional investments in capital assets. Occupancy expense equaled $42.6 million, down 6% from $45.3 million in the prior year quarter.
Other operating expenses totaled $62.9 million, an increase of 16% as compared to $54.2 million in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting increased charges associated with account servicing activities, partially offset by a reduction of an accrual related to a tax on bonus payments to certain employees in the United Kingdom.
Income tax expense of $81.8 million was recorded in the current quarter resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.5%. The prior year quarter provision for income taxes was $70.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.3%. The prior year quarter included $17.4 million of income tax benefits relating to the resolution of certain state and structured leasing tax positions taken in prior periods. The effective tax rate for the prior year quarter excluding the $17.4 million of income tax benefits was 34.0%.
Net income per common share in the third quarter of 2010 was $.64 as compared to $.82 per common share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income for the current quarter was $155.6 million compared to $199.6 million in the prior quarter. Operating earnings for the second quarter, which exclude the Visa related pre-tax benefit of $12.7 million, were $191.6 million, or $.78 per common share.
Consolidated revenues totaled $899.0 million, a decrease of $74.8 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2010. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $518.7 million, lower by $24.8 million, or 5%, from the second quarter.
 
 
 
 
C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $293.2 million, a decrease of $22.8 million, or 7%, from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting declines in securities lending revenue and investment management fees. Custody and fund administration fees decreased $2.7 million to $159.2 million from the second quarter's $161.9 million. C&IS investment management fees in the current quarter decreased 13% to $60.7 million from $69.4 million in the prior quarter, reflecting lower market valuations. Custody and fund administration fees were increased and investment management fees were decreased by $4.3 million each as a result of a fee reclassification. Securities lending revenue totaled $56.4 million in the current quarter compared with $66.3 million in the second quarter of 2010. Securities lending revenue includes the recovery of previously recorded unrealized asset valuation losses of approximately $39 million relating to a mark-to-market investment fund used in our securities lending activities compared to recoveries of approximately $37 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the current and prior quarter valuation recoveries, the decrease in securities lending fees of approximately $12 million is attributable to lower spreads on the investment of cash collateral and lower average volumes from the prior quarter's levels, which benefited from the international dividend season.
PFS trust, investment and other servicing fees decreased $2.0 million, or 1%, to $225.5 million. The decrease in PFS fees primarily reflects lower market valuations through most of the quarter, partially offset by new business and reduced waived fees. Waived fees in money market mutual funds were $10.4 million in the third quarter as compared with $12.9 million in the prior quarter and are attributable to the continued low level of short-term interest rates.
Foreign exchange trading income decreased $26.5 million, or 23%, to $88.9 million, reflecting reduced levels of market volatility as compared to the second quarter.
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in the current quarter increased $.6 million to $243.0 million as compared with $242.4 million in the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher earning assets, partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The current quarter net interest margin was 1.44%, down from 1.47% in the second quarter, and continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment.
 
 
 
 
Other operating income of $27.7 million for the current quarter was down $9.7 million, or 26%, from $37.4 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter decrease primarily reflects the $6.3 million loss resulting from the discontinuance of certain cash flow hedges.
The provision for credit losses totaled $30.0 million in the current quarter and net charge-offs totaled $30.3 million. This compares to a provision of $50.0 million and net charge-offs of $38.3 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Noninterest expenses totaled $622.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of $7.7 million, or 1%, from the second quarter's $614.4 million. Excluding the prior quarter $12.7 million Visa related indemnification benefit, noninterest expenses decreased $5.0 million, or 1%.
Compensation and employee benefit expenses totaled $333.3 million, down 1% from $337.0 million in the prior quarter, primarily reflecting a reduction in performance-based compensation expense.
Outside services totaled $110.7 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $114.6 million in the second quarter of 2010, reflecting lower costs associated with sub-custodian and technical services.
Equipment and software expenses totaled $72.6 million, up 4%, or $2.8 million, from $69.8 million in the prior quarter due to higher levels of depreciation expense. Net occupancy expense equaled $42.6 million, up 2% from $41.9 million in the prior quarter. Other operating expenses totaled $62.9 million, a decrease of 1% from $63.8 million in the second quarter. The decrease reflects the reduction of an accrual related to tax on bonus payments in the United Kingdom and lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums, partially offset by higher charges associated with account servicing activities.
Total income tax expense was $81.8 million for the current quarter, representing an effective rate of 34.5%. Income tax expense was $100.2 million in the prior quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 33.4%.
 
 
 
Total assets averaged $74.7 billion for the current quarter, up 5% from last year's third quarter average of $71.2 billion. Earning assets averaged $67.0 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter. Average investment securities increased 16% to $20.3 billion in the current quarter as compared to $17.6 billion in the prior year quarter.

Residential mortgages averaged $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 1% from the prior year's third quarter, and represented 40% of the total average loan and lease portfolio, while personal loans averaged $5.1 billion, up 9% from last year's third quarter.
Total stockholders' equity averaged $6.7 billion, up 7% from the prior year's third quarter average of $6.2 billion. The current quarter increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings. The prior year quarter average included the repurchase of the warrant issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program at a cost of $87 million.
Northern Trust's risk-based capital ratios remained strong at September 30, 2010, with the Corporation's tier 1 capital ratio of 13.2%, total risk-based capital ratio of 15.3%, and leverage ratio of 9.3% each exceeding the regulatory requirements for classification as a "well capitalized" institution established by U.S. banking regulators of 6%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Each of Northern Trust's U.S. subsidiary banks had capital ratios at September 30, 2010 that were above the levels required for classification as a "well capitalized" institution.
