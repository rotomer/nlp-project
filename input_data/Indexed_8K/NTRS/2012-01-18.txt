News Release
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Chicago, January 18, 2012) Northern Trust Corporation today reported fourth quarter net income per common share of $.53 compared with net income per common share of $.64 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $.70 per common share in the third quarter of 2011. Net income was $130.2 million in the current quarter, compared with $157.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, and $170.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net income in the current period was impacted by restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges that totaled $61.0 million ($39.8 million after tax, or $.17 per common share). Net income in the third quarter of 2011 was impacted by restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges totaling $4.2 million ($2.9 million after tax, or $.01 per common share). Return on average common equity was 7.18% in the current quarter, compared to 9.10% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 9.53% in the third quarter of 2011.
Reported net income per common share for the full year was $2.47, compared to the prior year's $2.74 per common share. Net income for 2011 totaled $603.6 million compared to
 
the prior year's $669.5 million. Restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges for the full year totaled $91.6 million ($59.8 million after tax, or $.25 per common share). Return on equity for the full year 2011 was 8.59%, compared with 10.09% for 2010.
Frederick H. Waddell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our results for the fourth quarter and the full year reflect strong new business but were impacted by the difficult conditions in which we currently operate. We have been actively analyzing various aspects of our businesses and technology to identify opportunities to deliver more value to our clients and shareholders. Through these efforts we have developed and begun to implement initiatives that we expect will sustainably improve productivity and profitability. These profit improvement initiatives are expected to benefit annual pre-tax income by approximately $250 million by the end of 2013.
The restructuring charges recorded this quarter and earlier this year include the planned elimination of approximately 700 positions, and additional positions will be eliminated through attrition. However, we will continue to invest and hire to support the growth of our business."
Charges recorded in the current quarter and full year totaled $61.0 million ($39.8 million after tax, or $.17 per common share) and $91.6 million ($59.8 million after tax, or $.25 per common share), respectively. Restructuring charges include severance expense, consulting expense, charges related to software write-offs, and reductions in office space. The following table details the current quarter and full year 2011 charges.
 
 
 
Net income per common share in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $.53 compares to $.64 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income for the current quarter was $130.2 million compared to $157.1 million in the prior year quarter. Net income in the current quarter and prior year quarter each benefited from reductions of a liability related to potential losses from indemnified litigation involving Visa, Inc. (Visa). The associated pre-tax expense reductions totaled $13.0 million ($8.0 million after tax, or $.03 per common share) in the current quarter and $20.3 million ($12.9 million after tax, or $.05 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating earnings, which exclude the Visa related after-tax benefits, were $122.2 million, or $.50 per common share, in the current quarter and $144.2 million, or $.59 per common share, in the prior year quarter. Operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of operating earnings to reported earnings prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is included on page 13.
Consolidated revenue of $955.6 million in the current quarter, which includes $38.4 million attributable to 2011 acquisitions, increased $59.5 million, or 7%, from $896.1 million in the prior year quarter. Noninterest income, which represented 72% of revenue, increased $9.7 million, or 1%, to $683.8 million from the prior year quarter's $674.1 million. Net interest income for the quarter on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis increased $48.9 million, or 21%, to $281.2 million compared to $232.3 million in the prior year quarter.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees, which represented 57% of revenue, were $541.5 million in the current quarter compared to $504.6 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of $36.9 million, or 7%.
 
 
Assets under custody and assets under management form the primary basis of our trust, investment and other servicing fees. The following table provides Northern Trust's assets under custody and assets under management by business segment.
 
 
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) increased $37.1 million, or 14%, and totaled $305.7 million compared to the prior year quarter's $268.6 million.
 
C&IS custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased 24%, primarily reflecting the recent acquisitions and strong new business. C&IS investment management fees declined 10% as the benefit of new business was offset by waived fees in money market mutual funds due to the persistent low level of short-term interest rates. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS totaled $12.3 million in the current quarter compared with $3.6 million in the prior year quarter.
 
 
Trust, investment and other servicing fees from Personal Financial Services (PFS) totaled $235.8 million in the current quarter and $236.0 million in the prior year quarter. Strong new business and improved markets were offset by waived fees in money market mutual funds, which totaled $21.3 million in the current quarter compared with $10.3 million in the prior year quarter.
Foreign exchange trading income totaled $71.7 million, down $26.5 million, or 27%, compared with $98.2 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter decrease is attributable to reduced client volumes.
Other operating income totaled $37.7 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 11%, compared to $42.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to currency translation gains in the prior year quarter.
The prior year quarter included $7.1 million of credit-related other-than-temporary impairment of residential mortgage-backed securities. There were no credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in the current quarter.
Net interest income for the quarter on an FTE basis totaled $281.2 million, up $48.9 million, or 21%, compared to the prior year quarter. The increase primarily reflects higher levels of average earning assets, partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin. Average earning assets for the quarter increased $16.3 billion, or 23%, to $87.2 billion from the prior year quarter, while the net interest margin was 1.28%, down from 1.30% in the prior year quarter. The current quarter includes $7.0 million of income attributable to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the tax treatment for certain structured leasing transactions. The net interest margin absent the leasing related adjustment would have been 1.25%.
 
 
Average earning assets increased primarily due to increases in demand deposits and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits which were invested primarily in investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, and Federal Reserve deposits. Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. A reconciliation of reported net interest income to net interest income on an FTE basis is provided on page 13.
The provision for credit losses was $12.5 million in the current quarter and net charge-offs totaled $18.2 million. This compares to a provision of $40.0 million and net charge-offs of $44.0 million in the prior year quarter. Nonperforming loans decreased $39.3 million, or 12%, from the prior year quarter. Commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loans reflect improvement from the prior year quarter, while weakness persists within residential real estate loans. Other real estate owned decreased $24.3 million, or 53%, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting sales of properties.
The table below provides information regarding nonperforming assets, the allowance for credit losses, and associated ratios.
 
 
 
Noninterest expense totaled $771.7 million for the current quarter and includes $42.7 million attributable to recent acquisitions. The increase of $130.0 million, or 20% from $641.7 million in the prior year quarter primarily reflects the restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges totaling $61.0 million ($39.8 million after tax, or $.17 per common share). Excluding the current period's restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges, noninterest expenses of the recent acquisitions, and the current and prior year quarter Visa benefits, noninterest increased $19.0 million, or 3%.
Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, equaled $341.9 million, up $60.1 million, or 21%, compared to $281.8 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to $28.6 million of severance related charges recorded in connection with initiatives to reduce staff expense levels, higher full-time equivalent staff levels, partially attributable to recent acquisitions, and annual salary increases. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at December 31, 2011 totaled approximately 14,053, up 10% from a year ago.
Employee benefit expense equaled $69.5 million, up $13.8 million, or 25%, compared to $55.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase for the current quarter reflects $4.0 million of severance related accruals and higher federal and unemployment insurance and pension expense.
Expense associated with outside services totaled $154.2 million, up $24.7 million, or 19%, from $129.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the $10.2 million of restructuring charges and higher expense associated with technical and sub-custodian services.
Equipment and software expense totaled $95.3 million, up $17.2 million, or 22%, compared to $78.1 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to $10.9 million of restructuring charges related to software write-offs and higher software costs attributable to the recent acquisitions.
 
 
Occupancy expense equaled $49.6 million, an increase of $9.0 million, or 22%, from $40.6 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the $6.3 million of restructuring charges related to reductions in office space and increased rent expense attributable to the recent acquisitions.
Income tax expense of $41.2 million was recorded in the current quarter resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.1%. The prior year quarter provision for income taxes was $57.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.7%. These compare to full-year effective tax rates of 31.7% and 32.4% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the current quarter reflects adjustments to the Corporation's intercompany service allocation methodology, the favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax matters, and reductions in state tax reserves. The effective tax rate in the prior year quarter reflected the Corporation's election to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of an additional non-U.S. subsidiary and lower state taxes.
Net income per common share of $.53 in the fourth quarter of 2011 compares to $.70 in the third quarter of 2011. Net income for the current quarter was $130.2 million compared to $170.4 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter includes $61.0 million ($39.8 million after tax, or $.17 per common share) of restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges. The prior quarter included restructuring, acquisition and integration related expenses totaling $4.2 million ($2.9 million after tax, or $.01 per common share). The current quarter also includes the Visa related benefit of $13.0 million ($8.0 million after-tax, or $.03 per common share).
Consolidated revenue of $955.6 million for the current quarter was down $16.0 million, or 2%, from $971.6 million in the prior quarter. Noninterest income decreased $31.0 million, or 4%, to $683.8 million from the prior quarter's $714.8 million. Net interest income for the current quarter on an FTE basis increased $14.6 million, or 6%, to $281.2 million from $266.6 million in the prior quarter.
 
 
Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $541.5 million in the current quarter compared to $555.3 million in the prior quarter. C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $305.7 million and $310.9 million in the current and prior quarter, respectively.
 
The decrease in C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees primarily reflects a decline in equity markets and an increase in money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by recent acquisitions and new business. Increases in C&IS custody and fund administration fees attributable to recent acquisitions were offset by the decline in equity markets. C&IS investment management fees for both the current and prior quarter reflect the impact of money market mutual fund fee waivers attributable to the continued low level of short-term interest rates and declines in equity markets. Money market mutual fund fee waivers for C&IS totaled $12.3 million in the current quarter compared with $10.1 million in the prior quarter.
PFS trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $235.8 million compared to the prior quarter's $244.4 million. The decrease in PFS fees primarily reflects a decline in equity markets from the prior quarter and higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Waived fees totaled $21.3 million in the current quarter compared to $19.0 million in the prior quarter.
Foreign exchange trading income for the quarter totaled $71.7 million, a decrease of $15.5 million, or 18%, compared to $87.2 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter decrease reflects reduced market volatility and client volumes.
The prior quarter included $1.3 million of credit-related other-than-temporary-impairment of residential mortgage-backed securities. There were no credit-related other-than-temporary-impairment charges recorded in the current quarter.
 
 
Net interest income on an FTE basis in the current quarter totaled $281.2 million, up $14.6 million, or 6%, compared with $266.6 million in the prior quarter, and included the $7.0 million leasing related adjustment. Average earning assets totaled $87.2 billion in the current quarter, an increase of 3% from $84.4 billion in the prior quarter, as higher demand deposits were principally reinvested in securities. The current quarter net interest margin was 1.28%, up from 1.25% in the prior quarter. The net interest margin absent the current quarter's leasing related adjustment would have been 1.25%.
The provision for credit losses totaled $12.5 million in the current quarter and $17.5 million in the prior quarter. Net charge-offs totaled $18.2 million for the current quarter compared to $28.6 million of net charge-offs in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans decreased $13.8 million, or 4%, as compared to the prior quarter. The current quarter reflects improvement in commercial and institutional loans, while weakness persists within residential real estate loans.
Noninterest expense totaled $771.7 million for the current quarter. The increase of $70.4 million, or 10%, from $701.3 million in the prior quarter primarily reflects the restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges totaling $61.0 million ($39.8 million after tax, or $.17 per common share). Excluding the current and prior quarter restructuring, acquisition and integration related charges of $61.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, and the current quarter's $13.0 million Visa related benefit, noninterest expense in the current quarter increased $26.6 million, or 4%.
Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, was $341.9 million for the current quarter, up $30.8 million, or 10%, from $311.1 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to the $28.6 million of severance related charges recorded in connection with initiatives to reduce staff expense levels.
Employee benefit expense equaled $69.5 million, up $2.8 million, or 4%, compared to $66.7 million in the prior quarter. Employee benefit expense for the current quarter includes $4.0 million of severance related expense.
 
 
Expense for outside services totaled $154.2 million in the current quarter, up $14.5 million, or 10%, compared to $139.7 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due to the $10.2 million of restructuring charges and increased technical services expense.
Equipment and software expense totaled $95.3 million in the current quarter, up $19.0 million, or 25%, from $76.3 million in the prior quarter, due primarily to the $10.9 million of restructuring charges relating to software write-offs and increased software costs attributable to the recent acquisitions.
Occupancy expense equaled $49.6 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 9%, from $45.5 million in the prior quarter, due primarily to the $6.3 million of restructuring charges relating to reductions in office space.
Other operating expense totaled $74.2 million, up $12.2 million, or 20%, from $62.0 million in the prior quarter, primarily reflecting increased business promotion and higher charges associated with account servicing activities.
Total income tax expense was $41.2 million for the current quarter, representing an effective rate of 24.1%. Income tax expense was $82.4 million in the prior quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 32.6%. These compare to the 2011 full-year effective tax rate of 31.7%. The decline in the effective rate for the current quarter reflects adjustments to the Corporation's intercompany service allocation methodology, the favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax matters, and reductions in state tax reserves.
 
 
Total stockholders' equity averaged $7.2 billion, up $341.7 million, or 5%, from the prior year quarter's average of $6.8 billion. The current quarter increase primarily reflects the retention of earnings, partially offset by the payment of dividends and repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation's share buyback program. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Corporation repurchased 1,599,572 shares at a cost of $79.4 million ($49.63 average price per share). An additional 5.6 million shares are authorized for repurchase after December 31, 2011 under the current share buyback program.
Northern Trust's risk-based capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2011, with the Corporation's tier 1 capital ratio of 12.5%, total risk-based capital ratio of 14.2%, and tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.3% each exceeding the regulatory requirements for classification as a "well capitalized" institution established by U.S. banking regulators of 6%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Northern Trust's U.S. subsidiary bank had capital ratios at December 31, 2011 that were above the levels required for classification as a "well capitalized" institution.
The ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 12.1% at December 31, 2011 and 13.0% at December 31, 2010. The following table provides a reconciliation of tier 1 common equity to tier 1 capital calculated in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and GAAP.
 
Northern Trust is providing the ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets in addition to its capital ratios prepared in accordance with regulatory requirements and GAAP as it is a measure that Northern Trust and investors use to assess capital adequacy.
 
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes Visa related indemnification benefits, to reported earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of operating earnings in addition to reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP provides a clearer indication of the results and trends in Northern Trust's core businesses.
