SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549-1004 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) November 26, 2002 ------------------- Commission Registrant; State of Incorporation I.R.S.

Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure As part of an ongoing review process, management of Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC), Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC, and, together with CYAPC and YAEC, the Yankee Companies), as part of ongoing litigation in the Court of Claims against the Department of Energy, prepared revised estimates of the cost of decommissioning, respectively, the Connecticut Yankee nuclear unit (CY), the Yankee Rowe nuclear unit (Yankee Rowe) and the Maine Yankee nuclear unit (MY). CY, Yankee Rowe and MY have been permanently shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities. The estimated costs of decommissioning CY, Yankee Rowe and MY have increased by approximately $150 million, $190 million and $40 million, respectively, over prior estimates. Such prior estimates estimated costs were included in the Yankee Companies' rates which have been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for inclusion in the Yankee Companies' rates. The new cost estimates will be revised from time to time based on information available to the Yankee Companies regarding future costs. The new estimates are attributable mainly to increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, security and liability and property insurance. Northeast Utilities' (NU) electric operating subsidiaries collectively own 49% of CYAPC, 38.5% of YAEC and 20% of MYAPC. Their respective shares of the increased costs would be approximately as follows: The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P): $104 103 million; Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH): $23 million; and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO): $29 million. NU expects the Yankee Companies to seek recovery of these increases in rate applications to be filed in due course with the FERC, with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. The timing, amount and outcome of these filings cannot be predicted at this time. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO would expect in turn to seek recovery of their respective shares of any allowed increases from ratepayers through appropriate state and federal rate proceedings. For further information concerning the Yankee Companies and their decommissioning estimates, see "Item 1. Business - Nuclear Generation" in NU's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Nuclear Decommissioning and Plant Closure Costs" in NU's Notes to its 2001 Financial Statements. SIGNATURE PAGE TO FOLLOW
