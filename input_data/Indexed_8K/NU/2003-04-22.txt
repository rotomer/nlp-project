Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Jeffrey R. Kotkin Office: (860) 665-5154 NU REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS BERLIN, Connecticut, April 22, 2003 - Northeast Utilities (NU-NYSE) today reported first-quarter 2003 earnings of $60.2 million, or $0.47 per share, compared with earnings of $18.6 million, or $0.14 per share, in the first quarter of 2002. Results for the first quarter of 2002 included write-offs totaling $10 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily related to NU's investment in NEON Communications, Inc. First-quarter 2003 results included no similar write-offs. Michael G. Morris, NU chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the favorable comparison was driven primarily by dramatically improved results at NU's competitive energy businesses. Those businesses, which include Select Energy, Inc., NU's competitive wholesale and retail energy marketing subsidiary, earned $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with a loss of $20.1 million in the first quarter of 2002. Select Energy's wholesale business, which includes 1,438 megawatts of generation and a smaller energy trading function, earned nearly $7 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with a loss of approximately $6 million in the same period of 2002. The first-quarter 2002 results included approximately $10 million of after-tax energy trading losses. Morris said both the wholesale and retail groups benefited from improved management of Select's book of electric and natural gas purchase and sale obligations. First Quarter 2002 Reported EPS $0.14 Investment write-offs $0.08 2002 Adjusted EPS $0.22 Better regulated results $0.04 Reduced trading losses $0.08 Improved competitive results $0.12 Lower share count $0.01 2003 Reported EPS $0.47 "We are very pleased with the direction our competitive businesses are heading and expect to record profits in all quarters this year," Morris said. Overall, NU's regulated businesses had comparable performance in the first quarter of 2003 and the same period of 2002. Much colder weather resulted in an 8.9 percent increase in regulated retail electric sales and an 18.3 percent increase in total regulated firm natural gas sales in the first three months of 2003, compared with the same period of 2002. Those gains were largely offset by lower pension credits and the absence of earnings related to the Seabrook nuclear power plant. The NU system sold its 40-percent share of Seabrook on November 1, 2002. Earnings at The Connecticut Light and Power Company totaled $25.3 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $20.3 million in the same period of 2002. Earnings at Public Service Company of New Hampshire were $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2002. Yankee Energy System, Inc. earned $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $12.6 million in the first three months of 2002. Western Massachusetts Electric Company earned $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $6.9 million in the same period of 2002. Morris said earnings per share also benefited from its ongoing share repurchase program. NU repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares in the first quarter of 2003 and had approximately 126.6 million shares outstanding as of March 31, 2003. NU has board approval to repurchase up to 5.5 million additional shares before July 1, 2003. Morris said NU continues to project earnings of between $1.10 per share and $1.30 per share in 2003. Those figures assume earnings of between $1.05 per share and $1.15 per share at its regulated business and between $0.15 per share and $0.25 per share at its competitive businesses. NU also projects parent company debt and other expenses of approximately $0.10 per share.
