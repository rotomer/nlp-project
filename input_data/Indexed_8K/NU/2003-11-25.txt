Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure As part of its transition to self performance of decommissioning, management of Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC) has prepared a draft updated estimate of the cost of decommissioning the Connecticut Yankee nuclear unit. The new draft estimate reflects primarily the impacts of the termination of the turnkey decommissioning contractor, Bechtel Power Corporation, in July 2003 for default and the fact that CYAPC is now self-performing completion of the decommissioning project. The draft estimate includes an increase of approximately $270 million over the estimate reported in November 2002. CYAPC had terminated its decommissioning contract with Bechtel in July 2003 due to Bechtel's history of incomplete and untimely performance and refusal to perform remaining decommissioning work. In June, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC in Connecticut Superior Court asserting a number of claims, including wrongful termination. In August, 2003, CYAPC filed a counterclaim, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing. Bechtel has departed the site and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process. The estimate which was previously updated and reported in November 2002 included an increase of approximately $140 million as compared to the cost estimate that had been approved as part of the April 2000 rate case settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The 2002 updated estimate stemmed primarily from additional security costs as well as the corollary economic impacts of increased insurance costs and other factors. The total current draft updated cost estimate of approximately $820 million represents an aggregate increase of approximately $410 million over the 2000 FERC rate case settlement. The 2003 draft cost estimate has not been finalized and is undergoing review. CYAPC is required to update its decommissioning cost estimate through a filing with the FERC by no later than July 1, 2004. Northeast Utilities' (NU) electric operating subsidiaries collectively own 49% of CYAPC, and their aggregate share of the estimated increased cost would be approximately $132.3 million. Their respective shares of the estimated increased costs would be as follows: The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P") ($93.2 million), Public Service Company of New Hampshire ("PSNH") ($13.5 million) and Western Massachusetts Electric Company ("WMECO") ($25.7 million). CYAPC is seeking recovery of additional decommissioning costs and other damages from Bechtel and, if necessary, its surety. In pursuing this recovery through pending litigation, CYAPC is also exploring options to structure an appropriate rate application to be filed in due course with the FERC, with any resulting adjustments being charged to its sponsors including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. The timing, amount and outcome of these filings cannot be predicted at this time. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO would expect in turn to seek recovery of their respective shares of any allowed increases from ratepayers through appropriate state and federal rate proceedings.

Business - Nuclear Generation" in NU's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Nuclear Decommissioning and Plant Closure Costs" in NU's Notes to its 2002 Financial Statements and Part II, Item 1(3) Legal Proceedings, in NU's Quarterly Report on Form 10Q for the period ending September 30, 2003.
