OTHER EVENTS. On December 22, 2003, The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P") and Select Energy, Inc. ("Select"), affiliates of Northeast Utilities ("NU"), and various other parties reached an agreement in principle to settle responsibility, as between CL&P and its standard offer suppliers, one of which was Select, for certain incremental locational marginal pricing costs incurred during 2003. The parties had been ordered by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") Settlement Judge to file a definitive settlement agreement reflecting this understanding with a FERC hearing judge by January 22, 2004. This filing has been delayed because certain details of the agreement have not yet been finalized, but NU believes those issues will be resolved. Once filed, the agreement would be subject to review by the hearing judge and approval of FERC. In anticipation of the resolution of this matter, NU will record a reserve of approximately $36 million after tax, or $0.28 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. For further information, see NU's and CL&P's Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 22, 2003 and Management's Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 4.
