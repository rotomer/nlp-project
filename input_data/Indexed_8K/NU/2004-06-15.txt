Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure On June 14, 2004, Northeast Utilities Service Company, on behalf of The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) and two other Northeast Utilities (NU) subsidiaries (NU Companies), filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a settlement agreement that will resolve all material issues in the NU Companies' transmission rate case that was initiated in August 2003. Other parties to the settlement include the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, and the New Hampshire Office of Consumer Advocate. The settlement is subject to FERC approval. In October 2003, the FERC permitted the NU Companies to put revised transmission rates into effect, subject to refund, beginning on October 28, 2003, and set the rates for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. Under the settlement, NU will be permitted to implement a formula rate for transmission service that will track NU's transmission costs as they change over time. Rates will be established initially based on the projected costs of transmission for the following year, with true-ups to actual costs when they are known. The costs of transmission upgrades, such as CL&P's proposed 345kV transmission reinforcement projects for southwest Connecticut, will be included in FERC- regulated transmission rates in the year in which the upgrades are placed into service. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will seek rate recovery from retail ratepayers through various recovery mechanisms approved by their respective state regulatory bodies. The settlement agreement authorizes the NU Companies to earn a return on equity of 11.0 percent from October 28, 2003, until a FERC-approved New England Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) becomes operational. At that time, the NU Companies will earn whatever return on equity is established in hearings on the New England RTO proposal, which are scheduled to commence in December 2004. In its original rate filing, the NU Companies had requested an authorized return on equity of 11.75 percent. Management does not believe that the lower ROE, if approved by the FERC, will result in NU changing its current 2004 earnings projections of between $1.20 per share and $1.40 per share. For further information, reference is made to NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, Item 1. "Business- Regulated Electric Operations-Regional and System Coordination." This Current Report on form 8-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are statements of future expectations and not facts.
