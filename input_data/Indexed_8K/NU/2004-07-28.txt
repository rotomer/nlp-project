Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Jeffrey R. Kotkin OFFICE: (860) 665-5154 NU REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS BERLIN, Connecticut, July 28, 2004- Northeast Utilities (NU-NYSE) today reported second quarter 2004 earnings of $22.9 million, or $0.18 per fully diluted share, compared with earnings of $26.9 million, or $0.21 per fully diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003. For the first six months of 2004, NU earned $90.3 million, or $0.71 per share, compared with earnings of $87.1 million, or $0.69 per share fully diluted, in the first half of 2003. Results for the second quarter and first half of 2004 include the write-down of approximately half of NU's $7.5 million investment in a fuel cell development company. That write-down reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. The following table reconciles 2004 and 2003 second quarter and first half earnings. Additional tables reconciling 2004 and 2003 results by business lines and regulated companies are included at the end of the news release. Second First Half Quarter 2003 Reported EPS $0.21 $0.69 Regulated results $0.09 $0.05 Competitive results ($0.07) $0.04 Investment write-downs ($0.02) ($0.03) Other ($0.03) ($0.04) 2004 Reported EPS $0.18 $0.71 Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said NU's second quarter results reflect improved results at three of NU's Utility Group companies, offset by an anticipated decline in earnings at NU Enterprises, Inc. (NUEI). Shivery noted that NUEI, which includes Select Energy, Inc., NU's competitive energy marketing subsidiary, earned $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $21.7 million in the first half of 2004, compared with earnings of $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2003 and $17.1 million in the first half of 2003. Shivery said NUEI's wholesale marketing business, including its ownership of approximately 1,440 megawatts of pumped storage, coal and hydroelectric generation assets, earned $8.4 million less in the second quarter of 2004 compared with 2003 and $1.6 million more in the first half of 2004, compared with the first half of 2003. As described earlier this year, Select Energy's 2004 earnings pattern is significantly affected by seasonal margins in its wholesale business. Select Energy's cost per kilowatt-hour for procuring electricity is relatively flat throughout the year. However, contracted sales prices with some of Select Energy's wholesale customers were higher in the first quarter and lower in the second quarter of 2004, creating better margins in the first quarter of 2004 and lower margins in the second quarter. Improvements in NUEI's retail marketing business were due primarily to increased volume and margins. Combined earnings at NU's four regulated businesses increased by $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared with the same period of 2003, and by $6.9 million in the first half of 2004, compared with the first half of 2003. Higher second quarter earnings at The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) were due primarily to a retail rate increase which took effect on January 1, 2004 and higher retail sales. Western Massachusetts Electric Company's reduced results in the first half of 2004 were due to reduced pension income and higher depreciation expense. Yankee Gas Services Company second quarter results benefited from lower tax expense. Public Service Company of New Hampshire's second quarter results were negatively affected by higher pension and other operating costs. Regulated retail electric sales increased 3.7 percent in the first half of 2004, compared with the first half of 2003, 4.6 percent on a weather adjusted basis. Second quarter retail electric sales increased 4.8 percent in 2004 compared with the same period of 2003, 5.7 percent on a weather adjusted basis. Shivery attributed the higher sales to a number of factors, including higher use per residential customer and the acquisition of approximately 11,000 customer accounts on January 1, 2004 from Connecticut Valley Electric Company. Shivery said there were minimal impacts in the second quarter from ongoing rate cases involving NU's regulated companies. The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control is scheduled to finalize a decision by August 4 on reconsideration of last December's CL&P distribution and transmission rate case decision. As a result, there was little impact from a June 24, 2004 draft decision recorded in CL&P's second quarter results. Likewise, an agreement filed earlier this month with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to raise PSNH retail distribution rates by $3.5 million on October 1, 2004 and $10 million on June 1, 2005, had no impact on this past quarter. Shivery said a pending settlement of NU's transmission rate case before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2004. Parent company losses were higher in the second quarter of 2004 due in part to greater benefits from an interest rate swap in the second quarter of 2003. Shivery said NU continues to estimate that it will earn between $1.20 per share and $1.40 per share in 2004. Financial results for each business line and regulated subsidiary are as follows: Three months ended June 30, 2004 Second Second Increase (in millions of dollars) Quarter Quarter (Decrease) 2004 2003 Wholesale marketing $4.2 $12.6 ($8.4) Retail marketing $0.3 ($2.0) $2.3 Services and other ($1.6) $1.3 ($2.9) NUEI total $2.9 $11.9 ($9.0) CL&P $17.3 $4.7 $12.6 PSNH $6.0 $11.1 ($5.1) WMECO $3.6 $2.6 $1.0 Yankee Gas $0.2 ($2.9) $3.1 Utility Group total $27.1 $15.5 $11.6 Investment write-down ($2.4) --- ($2.4) Parent and other ($4.7) ($0.5) ($4.2) Reported Earnings $22.9 $26.9 ($4.0) Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 First Half First Half Increase (in millions of dollars) 2004 2003 (Decrease) Wholesale marketing $21.0 $19.4 $1.6 Retail marketing $2.6 ($3.9) $6.5 Services and other ($1.9) $1.6 ($3.5) NUEI total $21.7 $17.1 $4.6 CL&P $43.5 $30.0 $13.5 PSNH $17.8 $21.9 ($4.1) WMECO $7.1 $8.7 ($1.6) Yankee Gas $12.1 $13.0 ($0.9) Utility Group $80.5 $73.6 $6.9 total Investment write-downs ($3.9) --- ($3.9) Parent and other ($8.0) ($3.6) ($4.4) Reported Earnings $90.3 $87.1 $3.2 Northeast Utilities is a Fortune 500 diversified energy company located in Connecticut with operations throughout the Northeast.
