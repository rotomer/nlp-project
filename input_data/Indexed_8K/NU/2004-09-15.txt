"John's leadership at Northeast Utilities since joining us eight years ago has transformed our financial position," said Charles W. Shivery, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Northeast Utilities. "He presided over the re- establishment of our financial stability during the nuclear turnaround, guided our successful utility restructuring process, including the establishment of our competitive businesses, and helped guide our recovery following our 18 months of merger negotiations." "Although John's retirement was planned, we will miss him. He can leave knowing he has left our company in strong financial shape, with the best credit rating in over 30 years," added Shivery. "And, he passes his leadership to a uniquely-qualified successor, David McHale," Shivery continued. "Dave's current role as treasurer has been an expanded one, during which he has had the responsibility for bank and investor relations, cash management, financial planning and analysis and investment management. In addition, he has just lead a successful enterprise planning process for the corporation." Forsgren, 58, joined Northeast Utilities in 1996, after a 25- year career in corporate finance leadership positions in other industries.
