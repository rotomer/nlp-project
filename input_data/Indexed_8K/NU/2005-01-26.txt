On January 25, 2005, Northeast Utilities (the "Company") issued a news release announcing that it will restate its second and third quarter 2004 financial statements and is lowering its previous 2004 earnings guidance as a result of a determination that mark-to-market accounting, rather than accrual accounting, is the correct accounting for certain natural gas contracts established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England. The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of the section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. Item 4.02(a) - Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. On January 25, 2005, the Company issued a news release announcing that it will restate its second and third quarter 2004 financial statements and is lowering its previous 2004 earnings guidance as a result of a determination that mark-to-market accounting, rather than accrual accounting, is the correct accounting for certain natural gas contracts established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England. Under mark-to-market accounting, changes in the fair value of the natural gas contracts are recorded in earnings currently, rather than as the natural gas is delivered, as under accrual accounting. The Company has concluded that its use of accrual accounting for those natural gas contracts in the second and third quarters of 2004 was not correct and will mark them to market when it restates results from those quarters and reports year-end 2004 results. The Company's decision is based on its belief that adopting mark-to-market accounting treatment for the natural gas contracts is the most appropriate method for dealing with this complex subject. The Company's decision to adopt mark-to-market accounting and the decision to restate the second and third quarter 2004 financial statements was made on January 24, 2005 with the concurrence of the Company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, and the approval of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Trustees.

Exhibit 99.1 NU LOGO Northeast P. O. Box 270 Utilities System Hartford, CT 06141-0270 107 Selden Street Berlin, CT 06037 (860)-665-5000 www.nu.com News Release Contact: Jeffrey R. Kotkin Office: (860) 665-5154 NU TO RESTATE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; REVISES EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR 2004 BERLIN, Connecticut, January 25, 2005-Northeast Utilities (NU- NYSE) today announced that it will restate its second and third quarter 2004 financial statements and is lowering its previous 2004 earnings guidance. These actions result from a determination that mark-to-market accounting, rather than accrual accounting, is the correct accounting for certain natural gas contracts established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England. NU reported in November 2004 that its competitive marketing subsidiary, Select Energy, Inc., had not won its expected level of New England wholesale load for 2005. NU also said that adverse movements in commodity prices had negatively affected positions taken in anticipation of achieving targeted sales goals. While NU is recording losses on those natural gas contracts in 2004, the electricity contracts Select Energy secured to serve the anticipated wholesale load currently have significant value and are expected to benefit 2005 results. Those electricity contracts will remain on accrual accounting. Under mark-to-market accounting, changes in the fair value of the natural gas contracts are recorded in earnings currently, rather than as the natural gas is delivered, as under accrual accounting. NU has concluded that its use of accrual accounting for those natural gas contracts in the second and third quarters of 2004 was not correct and will mark them to market when it restates results from those quarters and reports year-end 2004 results. As a result of the use of mark-to-market accounting, NU will record an after-tax loss of $48.3 million, or $0.38 per share, in 2004 attributable to those contracts. Approximately $42 million of that loss is attributable to 2005 contracts and $6 million is associated with 2006 contracts. Reported second quarter 2004 earnings will be increased from $22.9 million to $24.0 million and third quarter 2004 results will be reduced from previously reported earnings of $39.1 million to a loss of $7.9 million. A $2.4 million loss on these contracts will be reflected in fourth quarter earnings, resulting in losses on the contracts in 2004 of $48.3 million. In addition to the changes in its competitive business results, NU now expects that its regulated businesses will be at or above their previously disclosed 2004 earnings range due to better than anticipated fourth quarter results. NU also expects previously estimated "Parent and Other" 2004 losses to increase as a result of write-downs of certain non-core investments totaling approximately $9 million, or 7 cents per share, for the full year. As a result of these developments, NU today revised its 2004 earnings per share guidance as follows: - more - Page 2 of 2 Previous guidance Current guidance ----------------- ---------------- 2004 Regulated $1.13-$1.19 $1.19-$1.24 Businesses Competitive $0.23-$0.25 ($0.15-$0.10) Businesses Parent and ($0.11-$0.09) ($0.19-$0.17) Other 2004 Total $1.25-$1.35 $0.85-$0.97 Because losses associated with the mark-to-market accounting will be recognized in 2004, NU now believes that its 2005 earnings could increase significantly, compared to its previous guidance, subject to market volatility and other risks. However, Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said, "Our competitive businesses have been unable to sustain the kind of financial performance we expect and, as a result, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of each of our competitive business lines in which the full range of alternative strategies will be considered. We expect to complete this review within the next several weeks and will provide new 2005 earnings guidance for those businesses and for NU as a whole at that time." Shivery added that NU expects its regulated businesses to earn between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005 and losses in its "Parent and Other" category to total between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005. These ranges are unchanged from previous guidance. The application of mark-to-market accounting for these natural gas contracts is not expected to have an impact on NU's cash flows or dividend policy in 2005. The company obtained the approval of the Audit Committee of the NU Board of Trustees and the concurrence of its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, in the application of mark-to-market accounting and the decision to restate the second and third quarter 2004 financial statements. NU has approximately 129 million common shares outstanding.
