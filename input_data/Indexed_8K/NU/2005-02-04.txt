This amendment changes the formula for calculating the target benefit under the SERP for officers of NU System Companies who become eligible for the target benefit on or after February 1, 2005. For these officers, the formula for calculating the target benefit uses an amount equal to 50 percent of the participant's Final Average Compensation. For officers who were eligible for the target benefit prior to February 1, 2005, the formula uses 60 percent of Final Average Compensation. The result is that an officer who becomes eligible for the target benefit under the SERP on or after February 1, 2005 is eligible for a smaller benefit than if he or she had become eligible for the target benefit prior to February 1, 2005.
