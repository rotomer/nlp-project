Other Events
In a decision dated October 12, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ("Second Circuit") held that the shareholders of Northeast Utilities ("NU") had no right to sue Consolidated Edison, Inc. ("CEI") for its alleged breach of the parties' merger agreement dated October 13, 1999 and reversed the March 21, 2003 opinion and order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York insofar as it denied CEI's motion for summary judgment as to NU's claim for the shareholder premium arising out of such breach.
For further information about this matter, reference is made to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2004 and Part II. Item 1. Legal Proceedings of its Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005.
