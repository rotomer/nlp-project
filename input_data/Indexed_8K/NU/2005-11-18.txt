Item 8.01 Other Events
On November 9, 2005, Public Service Company of New Hampshire ("PSNH") announced an agreement to work with other parties in New Hampshire, including state legislators, state energy and environmental officials, and certain state environmental groups, to support new legislation that would require PSNH to reduce mercury emissions from its coal-fired power plants at Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire and Schiller Station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in the aggregate by at least 80 percent by July 1, 2013.  If passed, the proposed legislation also would provide incentives for both maximizing reductions after 2013 and achieving mercury reductions in earlier years.
Under the proposed legislation, PSNH would install wet scrubber technology at Merrimack Station at a currently estimated cost of up to $250 million no later than July 1, 2013.  If the proposed legislation is enacted and regulatory approvals are obtained, major construction expenditures would be expected in 2011 and 2012.  As a result, PSNH has not changed its current capital expenditure projections for 2006-2010.  Together, the coal-fired units at Merrimack Station and Schiller Station generate 585 megawatts of electricity and represent a significant share of PSNH's base load generation.  
If the proposed legislation is enacted and the proposal is approved by various regulatory bodies, PSNH believes that related costs would be fully recoverable with a return through customer rates.  However, customer costs associated with the scrubber project are projected to be substantially mitigated as a result of the project's reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, offsetting the company's need to purchase SO emissions credits.
