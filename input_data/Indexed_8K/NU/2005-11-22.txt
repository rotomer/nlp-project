Financial Condition and Business Analysis
Executive Summary
The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this annual report.
Results and Outlook:
Northeast Utilities (NU or the company) reported earnings of $116.6 million in 2004 compared with earnings of $116.4 million in 2003 and $152.1 million in 2002.
After the payment of preferred dividends, earnings at the Utility Group increased by $23.1 million to $155.6 million, or $1.21 per share, in 2004 compared with $132.5 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2003.
Included in 2004 earnings is an after-tax loss of $48.3 million associated with mark-to-market accounting for certain natural gas positions established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England.  Results in 2004 also include after-tax investment write-downs totaling $8.8 million, primarily associated with NU's investments in a fuel cell development company and a telecommunications company.
Results in 2003 included a $36.9 million after-tax loss associated with the implementation of Standard Market Design (SMD) in Connecticut and a negative cumulative effect of an accounting change of $4.7 million from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities."
On March 9, 2005, NU completed its previously announced comprehensive review of its competitive energy businesses and decided that NU Enterprises will exit the wholesale marketing business. NU also concluded that NU Enterprises' energy services businesses are not central to NU's long-term strategy and do not meet the company's expectations of profitability. As a result, the company will explore ways to divest those businesses in a manner that maximizes their value. NU will retain its competitive generation and retail energy marketing businesses, because it believes that the generation assets and retail business are competitively positioned to create significant opportunities for those businesses over the next several years.
The Utility Group estimates that it will earn between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005. Parent and other costs, primarily related to interest expense, are estimated to total between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005. Because of the variety of methods the company could use to implement its decisions concerning the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses, NU will not provide a 2005 earnings range for its NU Enterprises businesses or for NU consolidated.
Regulatory Items:
NU resolved a number of outstanding regulatory issues, providing the company with more ratemaking certainty than it has had in a number of years. Among the most important items were:
Transmission:
On August 19, 2004, a Connecticut Superior Court dismissed the City of Norwalk's appeal of the Connecticut Siting Council's (CSC) approval of a 345 kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Bethel, Connecticut and Norwalk, Connecticut.
On September 16, 2004, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a settlement agreement with the states of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts that allowed the transmission business to implement a formula rate with an 11.0 percent return on equity (ROE).
CL&P:
On June 28, 2004, the FERC approved a settlement agreement to resolve the dispute over the implementation of SMD in Connecticut.  Under the settlement, The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) returned to its customers and suppliers, including affiliate Select Energy, Inc. (Select Energy), approximately $158 million of revenues collected from customers in 2003 and early 2004.
The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) issued a final decision on August 4, 2004 on CL&P's petition for reconsideration of the DPUC's December 2003 rate order. The decision had a positive earnings impact of $6.9 million in 2004.
On August 1, 2003, CL&P filed with the DPUC to establish transitional standard offer (TSO) rates equal to December 31, 1996 total rate levels.  On December 19, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision setting the average TSO rate at $0.1076 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) effective January 1, 2004.
As a result of higher supply charges, higher federally mandated congestion charges (FMCC) and a $25.1 million distribution rate increase approved by the DPUC in CL&P's rate case, on November 24, 2004, CL&P requested the DPUC to increase its TSO rate for 2005.  On December 22, 2004, the DPUC approved a 10.4 percent rate increase effective January 1, 2005 and allowed for the recovery of the remainder of the requested increase through existing and new refunds and overrecoveries.
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P is incurring as of February 1, 2005.
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed for approval for a 1.6 percent increase to TSO rates ($29.2 million) to collect additional FMCC from customers effective May 1, 2005. The increase is necessary to collect costs related to an additional Reliability Must Run (RMR) contract related to two generating plants located in southwest Connecticut.  The RMR contract has preliminary approval for billing from the FERC and is subject to a future review by the FERC prior to final approval.
Yankee Gas:
On September 3, 2004, the DPUC approved the application of Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas) to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility in Waterbury, Connecticut capable of storing 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas with an estimated cost of $108 million.
The DPUC approved the Yankee Gas rate case settlement agreement on December 8, 2004. The approval resulted in a $14 million increase in rates beginning January 1, 2005.
PSNH:
In October 2004, Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) received the approvals necessary to begin construction related to the conversion of one of three 50-megawatt units at the coal-fired Schiller Station to burn wood.
On September 2, 2004, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) approved the negotiated settlement of the PSNH rate case that was filed in 2003. The settlement agreement resulted in an annualized delivery rate increase of $3.5 million beginning October 1, 2004 and approval of another rate increase of $10 million on June 1, 2005.
On September 24, 2004, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting a change in the transition energy service rate for residential and small commercial customers and the default energy service rate (TS/DS) for large commercial and industrial customers for the period February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006. PSNH files for updated TS/DS rates periodically to ensure timely recovery of its costs. The NHPUC issued its order approving PSNH's proposed TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh on January 28, 2005.
WMECO:
On December 29, 2004, the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE) approved a settlement agreement to increase Western Massachusetts Electric Company's (WMECO) electricity distribution rates by $6 million annually effective January 1, 2005 and by an additional $3 million annually beginning January 1, 2006. The settlement also reduced WMECO's transition charge by approximately $13 million annually.
Liquidity:
During 2004, the Utility Group issued a total of $505 million of fixed-rate bonds and notes with maturities ranging from 10 years to 30 years. The debt was issued primarily to fund capital expenditure programs, repay higher cost debt and fund prior spent nuclear fuel obligations.
NU's capital expenditures, totaled $643.8 million in 2004, compared with $563.6 million in 2003 and $510.5 million in 2002. The increase resulted from increased spending on new electric transmission projects. NU projects capital expenditures of approximately $740 million in 2005.
NU's net cash flows from operations totaled $511.5 million in 2004, compared with $587.8 million in 2003 and $610.2 million in 2002.
Overview
 NU reported 2004 earnings of $116.6 million, or $0.91 per share, compared with earnings of $116.4 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2003 and $152.1 million or $1.18 per share in 2002.  All earnings per share amounts are reported on a fully diluted basis.
Consolidated:
Earnings in 2004 of $116.6 million, or $0.91 per share, include an after-tax loss of $48.3 million, or $0.38 per share, associated with mark-to-market accounting for certain natural gas positions established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England. Also included in 2004 earnings are after-tax investment write-downs of approximately $8.8 million ($13.8 million on a pre-tax basis), or $0.07 per share, primarily related to NU's investments in a fuel cell development company and a telecommunications company. NU's 2004 earnings were essentially unchanged from 2003. Utility Group earnings increased by $23.1 million due to increased rates and other positive regulatory developments. That increase was offset by increased losses at NU Enterprises and higher parent and other costs. Increased NU Enterprises losses were due primarily to a 2 004 negative mark-to-market loss on certain natural gas contracts. Higher parent and other costs were due to higher investment write-downs in 2004.
NU's 2003 earnings of $116.4 million or $0.91 per share include a charge of $36.9 million, or $0.29 per share, associated with a loss recorded for the settlement of a wholesale power contract dispute between CL&P and its three 2003 standard offer power suppliers, including an NU subsidiary, Select Energy. Also included in 2003 earnings was a negative $4.7 million after-tax cumulative effect of an accounting change as a result of the adoption of FIN 46. 2003 earnings decreased by $35.7 million compared to 2002. Earnings at the Utility Group decreased significantly in 2003 due to lower pension income and the absence of earnings related to the Seabrook nuclear unit (Seabrook). These decreases were partially offset by lower Utility Group controllable operation and maintenance costs. NU's 2003 results benefited from lower corporate-wide interest costs and improved performance at NU Enterprises from improved margins o n Select Energy's energy supply contracts, higher volumes, improved operation of NU Enterprises' generating facilities, and the absence of natural gas trading losses that occurred in the first half of 2002.  
NU's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 present the operations for the following companies as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation:
Select Energy Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (SESI) HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. (HEC/Tobyhanna) and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC (HEC/CJTS);
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc. (Reeds Ferry)), (SECI-NH) a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc. (SECI);
Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network); and
Woods Electrical Co., Inc. (Woods Electrical).  
For further information regarding these companies, see Note 17, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements.  NU's consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of shareholders' equity, and consolidated statements of capitalization were not impacted by this revision.
A summary of NU's earnings/(losses) by major business line for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:
(1)
The NU Enterprises losses include losses totaling $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and earnings totaling $4.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.
NU's revenues during 2004 increased to $6.5 billion from $5.9 billion in 2003 and from $5.2 billion in 2002. The increase in 2004 revenues was due to increased revenues from NU Enterprises primarily as a result of higher merchant energy retail sales volumes and higher prices. The remainder of the increase in 2004 revenues related to higher Utility Group transmission and distribution revenues as a result of higher rates and higher FMCC revenues.
The increase in 2003 revenues was due to increased revenues from NU Enterprises totaling $0.6 billion as a result of higher wholesale and retail sales  volumes and higher prices. The remainder of the increase in 2003 revenues was due to increases in electric sales at the Utility Group in 2003 as compared to 2002.
The Utility Group is comprised of CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas, including their transmission, distribution and generation businesses. After the payment of preferred dividends, earnings at the Utility Group increased by $23.1 million to $155.6 million, or $1.21 per share, in 2004 compared with $132.5 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2003. Earnings at the Utility Group were $198.3 million in 2002. The increase in Utility Group earnings during 2004 was primarily due to increases in CL&P's retail rates. CL&P's earnings increased in 2004 compared to 2003 by approximately $12 million due to amounts disallowed in the December 2003 rate case decision and subsequently allowed in the reconsideration decision. Those improvements were partially offset by lower pension income and higher interest and depreciation expense. A summary of Utility Group earnings by company for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:
Utility Group:
*After preferred dividends.
CL&P earned $82.5 million in 2004 after preferred dividends of $5.6 million, compared with $63.4 million in 2003 after preferred dividends of $5.6 million. CL&P's improved earnings resulted primarily from a retail rate increase that took effect January 1, 2004. These higher retail rates were offset by higher operating expenses, lower pension income and a higher effective tax rate. CL&P also benefited from the final decision on the reconsideration of CL&P's rate case, which had a positive after-tax impact of $6.9 million in 2004. In 2003, after-tax write-offs of approximately $5 million were recorded based on the DPUC's December 2003 rate case order. The higher effective tax rate was due to higher reversal of prior flow-through depreciation and other adjustments to tax expense totaling a negative $3.2 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 as opposed to a positive $5.5 million recorded in 2003.
PSNH earned $46.6 million in 2004, compared with $45.6 million in 2003. PSNH earnings were higher primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and an increase in retail sales of 3.1 percent. The lower effective tax rate and increase in sales were largely offset by higher operating expenses and higher pension expense. The lower effective tax rate was due to other adjustments to tax expense totaling a positive $5.4 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004.
WMECO earned $12.4 million in 2004, compared with $16.2 million in 2003. WMECO's 2004 earnings were lower due to lower pension income and higher interest and depreciation expense, offset by a 1.6 percent increase in retail sales.
Yankee Gas earned $14.1 million in 2004, compared with $7.3 million in 2003. Yankee Gas' 2004 results benefited from the absence of a negative $6.2 million adjustment to the estimate of unbilled revenues in 2003 and a lower effective tax rate. The lower effective tax rate was due to other adjustments to tax expense totaling a positive $4.3 million recorded in the second and third quarters of 2004.
Included in Utility Group company earnings are the results of the transmission business. Transmission business earnings were $29.5 million in 2004  as compared to $28.2 million in 2003. Transmission business earnings in 2004 are higher than 2003 primarily due to higher revenues resulting from the implementation of a FERC approved formula rate resulting in increased rates and $123 million of transmission projects that were placed in service. This forward-looking formula rate allows NU to place capital investments in rates immediately upon being placed in service. The formula rate took effect on October 28, 2003.
NU Enterprises, Inc. is the parent company of Northeast Generation Company (NGC), Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS), Select Energy, SESI and their respective subsidiaries, SECI, Reeds Ferry, and Woods Network, all of which are collectively referred to as "NU Enterprises." The generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) are also included in the results of NU Enterprises. The companies included in the NU Enterprises segment are grouped into two business segments: the merchant energy segment and the energy services business segment. The merchant energy business segment is comprised of Select Energy's wholesale marketing business, Select Energy's retail marketing business, and approximately 1,296 megawatts (MW) of pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets owned by NGC and 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets owned by HWP. The energy services business c onsists of the operations of NGS, including Woods Electrical, SESI, SECI and Woods Network.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.  
NU Enterprises:
On March 9, 2005, NU completed its previously announced comprehensive review of its competitive energy businesses and decided that NU Enterprises will exit the wholesale marketing business. NU also concluded that NU Enterprises' energy services businesses are not central to NU's long-term strategy and do not meet the company's expectations of profitability. As a result, the company will explore ways to divest those businesses in a manner that maximizes their value. NU will retain its competitive generation and retail energy marketing businesses, because it believes that the generation assets and retail business are competitively positioned to create significant opportunities for those businesses over the next several years.
NU Enterprises had a loss of $15.1 million in 2004, or $0.12 per share, compared with a loss of $3.4 million, or $0.03 per share in 2003, and a loss of $53.2 million, or $0.41 per share, in 2002.
NU Enterprises 2004 loss includes an after-tax loss of $48.3 million, or $0.38 per share, associated with mark-to-market accounting for certain natural gas positions established to mitigate the risk of electricity purchased in anticipation of winning certain levels of wholesale electric load in New England.
A summary of NU Enterprises' earnings/(losses) by business for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:
(1)
The energy services, parent and other losses include losses totaling $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and earnings totaling $4.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.
The mark-to-market loss on natural gas contracts was the primary reason for increased NU Enterprises losses in 2004. This loss was in the wholesale marketing portion of the merchant energy segment. However, merchant energy earnings benefited from improved results in the retail marketing portion of the merchant energy segment from increased commercial and industrial electric and natural gas sales. Retail marketing earned $5.1 million in 2004, compared to a loss of $1.8 million in 2003. Energy services, parent and other earnings decreased by $5.1 million in 2004 from 2003 due primarily to losses on a construction contract.
: Losses unrelated to the Utility Group and NU Enterprises totaled $23.9 million in 2004, compared with a loss of $12.7 million in 2003 and income of $7 million in 2002. The higher losses in 2004 were mostly attributable to investment write-downs related to NU's investments in a fuel cell development company and a telecommunications company and due to higher interest expenses. The higher losses in 2003 were mostly attributable to the negative $4.7 million cumulative effect of an accounting change associated with the adoption of FIN 46 recorded in 2003 and to Seabrook related gains recorded in 2002.
Parent and Other
Future Outlook
The Utility Group estimates that it will earn between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005. That range reflects earnings of between $0.96 per share and $1.00 per share in the regulated distribution and generation business and between $0.26 per share and $0.30 per share in the transmission business.
Utility Group:
The earnings of NU Enterprises will be impacted by many factors, including the amount of asset impairments or losses on disposals that could result from the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and explore ways to divest the energy services segment, the mark-to-market loss that may result from the application of mark-to-market accounting to certain wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are sold or until the commodities are delivered, and other closure costs. Accordingly, NU will not be providing NU Enterprises or NU consolidated 2005 earnings guidance.
NU Enterprises:
Parent and other costs, primarily related to interest expense, are estimated to total between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005.
Parent and Other:
Strategic Overview
The company has identified significant investment requirements in the Utility Group transmission and distribution businesses and expects to invest more than $3.7 billion in regulated electric and natural gas infrastructure from 2005 through 2009.
Based on current projections, NU expects that the need to invest heavily in regulated infrastructure to meet reliability requirements and customer growth will cause NU's Utility Group distribution and generation rate base to rise from $2.5 billion in 2004 to nearly $3.9 billion by the end of 2009. Based on currently projected expenditures and capital project completion dates, NU expects that the same factors will increase NU's Utility Group transmission rate base from approximately $460 million in 2004 to approximately $1.7 billion by the end of 2009.
: On March 9, 2005, NU completed its previously announced comprehensive review of each of NU Enterprises' businesses, in which a full range of alternative strategies was considered. That review considered:
NU Enterprises Business Review
The impact of the increase in competition in the New England wholesale energy markets over the last six months of 2004, which has affected Select Energy's profitability by reducing the number of bids won and by reducing the margins on the bids that are won;
The potential growth of the retail business, which had a significant improvement in earnings in 2004 and which serves a market that NU believes to be growing;
The competitiveness and opportunities for increased value for the 1,443 MW of generation currently owned by NU Enterprises;
The strategic fit of the energy services businesses; and
The impact of any significant changes on NU as a whole.
As a result of the comprehensive review, NU has decided that NU Enterprises will exit the wholesale marketing business. NU also concluded that NU Enterprises' energy services businesses are not central to NU's long-term strategy and do not meet the company's expectations of profitability. As a result, the company will explore ways to divest those businesses in a manner that maximizes their value. Those businesses include electrical, mechanical, telecommunications, commercial plumbing, and performance contracting companies. NU will retain its competitive generation and retail energy marketing businesses, because it believes that the generation assets and retail business are competitively positioned to create significant opportunities for those businesses over the next several years.
NU has concluded that the wholesale merchant energy sector in the power pools between Maine and Maryland is becoming increasingly competitive and that NU Enterprises' wholesale marketing business will be unable to attain the profit margins necessary to generate acceptable returns and cash flows. As a result, NU Enterprises will explore a number of alternatives for exiting the wholesale marketing business, including selling the wholesale franchise, selling existing contracts, restructuring longer term contracts, and allowing shorter term contracts to expire without being renewed. In the interim, NU Enterprises will only bid on new full requirements wholesale contracts to improve the value of its book of business by reducing existing electric positions.
NU Enterprises' marketing subsidiary, Select Energy, has built a very strong retail energy marketing franchise in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states, and the company expects to build on that market presence. Additionally, the number of commercial and industrial customers buying their electricity and natural gas from competitive suppliers is continuing to rise. Select Energy's retail marketing revenues in 2004 were approximately $850 million on sales of approximately 10 million megawatt-hours of electricity and 40 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Select Energy's retail marketing business serves approximately 30,000 commercial and industrial locations in the New England, New York and PJM power pools. Select Energy's retail marketing business projects revenues to grow to approximately $1 billion in 2005 because of a continued expansion of the retail market and its high customer retention rate of appro ximately 85 percent.
NU will retain its 1,443 MW of competitive generating assets because it expects that their value could increase significantly in the coming years. The competitive generating assets, which include pumped storage, hydroelectric, and coal-fired units, are contained within NGC and HWP subsidiaries. NU Enterprises also will retain its NGS subsidiary, which operates the NGC and HWP plants.
NU Enterprises accounted for approximately $2.0 billion of NU's revenue in 2004, excluding sales to affiliated regulated companies. The wholesale marketing business accounted for approximately $1 billion of that revenue and NU Enterprises' energy services businesses accounted for approximately $154 million.
NU Enterprises' energy services businesses include E.S. Boulos Company (Boulos) and Woods Electrical, both electrical contractors; Woods Network, a telecommunications contracting firm; SECI, an electrical, mechanical, and plumbing contractor; SESI, a performance contracting subsidiary that specializes in upgrading the energy efficiency of large governmental and institutional facilities.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.  
NU expects to record a charge in the first quarter of 2005 associated with the wholesale marketing and energy services business. The level of that charge will depend on a number of factors, including how the disposition of those businesses is accomplished.
The company expects that implementation of its decisions will have an impact on employment levels in those businesses but that the actual impact is not known at this time because the disposition process has just begun. It is the company's goal to minimize layoffs by using, to the extent possible, open positions within NU or by a possible sale of both the wholesale marketing franchise and the energy services businesses in which the buyers may offer positions to existing employees.
Liquidity
NU continues to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. At December 31, 2004, NU had $47 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand compared with $43.4 million at December 31, 2003. As discussed in Note 16, "Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements," the December 31, 2003 amount of cash and cash equivalents has been restated.
Consolidated:
Cash flows from operations decreased by $76.3 million from $587.8 million in 2003 to $511.5 million in 2004. Changes in current assets and liabilities were consistent from year to year and were decreases of approximately $91 million in 2003 and approximately $86 million in 2004. Increases in cash flows related to deferred taxes were offset by decreases related to regulatory refunds.
The decrease in year over year cash flows from regulatory (refunds)/overrecoveries is primarily due to lower Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) and Generation Service Charge (GSC) collections in 2004 as CL&P refunds amounts to its ratepayers for past over collections or uses those amounts to recover current costs. These refunds are also the primary reason for the positive change in year over year deferred income taxes, which has increased operating cash flows as refunded amounts were currently deducted for tax purposes. Lower taxes paid also benefited cash flows from operations in 2004 due to bonus tax depreciation on newly completed plant assets.
NU paid common dividends of $80.2 million in 2004, compared with $73.1 million in 2003 and $67.8 million in 2002. The increase reflects increases in quarterly common dividends of $0.0125 per share declared in the third quarters of 2002, 2003, and 2004. Management expects to continue to recommend that the NU Board of Trustees increase the common dividend on an annual basis, subject to the company's future earnings and cash requirements. On January 31, 2005, the Board of Trustees approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share, payable March 31, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005.
Capital expenditures described herein are cash capital expenditures and exclude cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portion of pension income. NU's capital expenditures totaled $643.8 million in 2004, compared with $563.6 million in 2003 and $510.5 million in 2002. NU's 2004 capital expenditures included $370.8 million by CL&P, $143.6 million by PSNH, $56.6 million by Yankee Gas, $38.6 million by WMECO, and $34.2 million by other NU subsidiaries, including $17.6 million by NU Enterprises. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily the result of higher transmission capital expenditures, which totaled $163.9 million in 2004, compared with $96.3 million in 2003 and $57.9 million in 2002. The company projects capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 billion over the five-year period from 2005 through 2009, including approximately $740 million in 2005. Capital spending projections are highly depende nt on regulatory approval of major projects, particularly transmission investments.
Management projects that NU will need in excess of $4 billion from 2005 through 2009 to meet its capital expenditure requirements, common and preferred dividends, and other cash requirements. NU expects to fund approximately half of this need through operating cash flows with the remainder expected to be funded through external financings and the sale of common shares. Management believes that the majority of the external financing will be debt but that NU will need to raise several hundred million dollars through the sale of its common shares. The timing and amount of those equity issuances will depend greatly on the timing of major transmission investments and the level of dividends and equity capital that will be paid to NU by its subsidiaries. Over the next five years, management expects the Utility Group to continue to issue debt annually while debt levels at NU parent and NGC continue to decline.
To maintain a capital structure that includes approximately 55 percent of total debt at each of the Utility Group companies, NU continues to infuse common equity. NU parent made a total of $94.5 million of common equity contributions to the Utility Group companies in 2004, including $88 million to CL&P. At December 31, 2004, NU parent had loaned on a temporary basis approximately $110 million to other NU companies, most of which was loaned to the Utility Group companies through the NU money pool. Over the course of 2005, these subsidiaries are expected to repay most of that amount to NU parent, which will use those proceeds and subsidiary dividends to fund NU's common dividend, meet NU parent interest and sinking fund obligations, and infuse additional common equity into the Utility Group companies, particularly CL&P. NU expects to continue to infuse additional equity into the regulated companies for several year s beyond 2005. To raise that additional equity, NU expects to sell common shares to the public as early as 2006.
The significant capital requirements of the Utility Group, particularly at CL&P, were one reason that the credit rating outlooks on various NU and subsidiary securities were lowered in 2004. Standard and Poor's (S&P) reduced the outlook on all NU securities it rates to "negative" from "stable." In 2004, S&P lowered its ratings on NGC's debt to BB+, below investment grade, and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) lowered its ratings on NGC debt to Baa3, its lowest investment grade ratings. Fitch Ratings changed the outlook on NU and CL&P debt to "negative" in January 2005. In  February 2005, Moody's reduced by one level the ratings of NU, CL&P, Yankee Gas, and NGC. It lowered by two levels the ratings on WMECO and affirmed with no change the ratings of PSNH. The ratings changes will result in modest increases in future borrowing costs for NU, CL& ;P and WMECO on their respective revolving credit agreements. The changes are not expected to have a material impact on borrowing costs when the Utility Group seeks long-term financing to support its capital investment plans. NGC did not issue new debt in 2004 and is not expected to issue new debt in the near future. All ratings of NU and subsidiary securities remain investment grade with the exception of Moody's and S&P ratings on NGC's bonds. As a result, those downgrades had no impact on the company's financial results.
On November 8, 2004, NU entered into a 5-year unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit (LOC) facility for $500 million on a short-term basis.  This facility is intended to provide liquidity, LOCs and necessary capital for NU Enterprises. At December 31, 2004, there were $100 million of borrowings  and $48.9 million of LOCs outstanding under this credit facility. For more information regarding the NU parent revolving credit facility, see Note 2, "Short-Term Debt," to the consolidated financial statements.
On November 8, 2004, the Utility Group entered into a 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility for $400 million. Under this credit facility, CL&P is able to borrow up to $200 million, and PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas will be able to borrow up to $100 million each on a short-term basis. There were $80 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at December 31, 2004. For more information regarding the Utility Group revolving credit facility, see Note 2, "Short-Term Debt" to the consolidated financial statements. In addition to its revolving credit line, CL&P has an arrangement with a financial institution under which CL&P can sell up to $100 million of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues. At December 31, 2004, CL&P had sold accounts receivable totaling $90 million to that financial institution. For more information regarding the sale of receivables, see Not e 1O, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Sale of Receivables" to the consolidated financial statements.
Utility Group:
On September 17, 2004, CL&P issued $150 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds at a fixed interest rate of 4.8 percent and also issued $130 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds at a fixed interest rate of 5.75 percent. CL&P used the proceeds from these issuances to repay short-term and redeem long-term debt.
During 2004, as part of the approved SMD settlement agreement, CL&P paid $83 million to its suppliers, of which $40.5 million was paid to affiliate Select Energy, and refunded $75 million to its customers. Of the combined payment and refund amount totaling $158 million, $124 million was funded from an escrow fund that was established during 2003 and 2004 as these SMD costs were being collected from customers. Additionally, the DPUC ordered a refund of $88.5 million in CTA/System Benefits Charge (SBC) overcollections over a seven-month period beginning with October 2004 consumption. The combination of the SMD and CTA/SBC refunds, when combined with CL&P's proposed capital expenditures, will negatively impact CL&P's liquidity. However, CL&P expects no difficulty in meeting these additional cash requirements.
Under FERC policy, transmission owners may capitalize debt and equity costs during the construction period through an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Debt costs capitalized offset interest expense with no impact on net income, while equity costs capitalized increase net income. CL&P expects to fund its construction expenditures with approximately 45 percent equity and 55 percent debt.
On July 22, 2004, PSNH issued $50 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds at a fixed interest rate of 5.25 percent. Proceeds were used to repay short-term debt and fund PSNH's capital expenditure program. In October 2004, PSNH received the approvals necessary to begin the construction related to the conversion of one of the coal-fired units at Schiller Station to burn wood. The NHPUC approved the project, but the NHPUC's approval has been appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. This project is expected to cost approximately $75 million.
On September 23, 2004, WMECO issued $50 million of 30-year senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 5.9 percent. Proceeds were used to finance a trust fund that will be used to meet WMECO's prior spent nuclear fuel liability of $49.3 million at December 31, 2004 which is recorded in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2004, the prior spent nuclear fuel trust totaled $49.3 million.
On January 30, 2004, Yankee Gas issued $75 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds carrying an interest rate of 4.8 percent. Yankee Gas issued an additional $50 million of 15-year first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of 5.26 percent on November 15, 2004. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds were primarily used to repay short-term debt incurred to redeem long-term debt.
During 2004 NGC repaid approximately $32 million of long-term debt and is scheduled to meet $37.5 million of sinking fund maturities in 2005. SESI borrowed a total of $7.8 million during 2004 to finance the implementation of energy saving improvements at customer facilities. In 2004, SESI sold $30 million of receivables related to the energy savings contract projects. The transfer of receivables to the unaffiliated third party qualified as a sale under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities  A Replacement of SFAS No. 125." Accordingly, the $30 million sold at December 31, 2004 is not included as debt in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, SESI had $93.2 million and $118 million of long-term debt outstanding, respectively. Funds to repay thes e borrowings are provided by SESI's energy savings contract project revenues. Performance of these energy savings contract projects is guaranteed by NU.

Nuclear Decommissioning and Plant Closure Costs
The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC) is currently in litigation with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel) over the termination of its decommissioning contract. On June 13, 2003, CYAPC gave notice of the termination of its contract with Bechtel for the decommissioning of its nuclear power plant. CYAPC terminated the contract due to Bechtel's incomplete and untimely performance and refusal to perform the remaining decommissioning work. Bechtel has departed the site, and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process.
CYAPC's estimated decommissioning and plant closure costs for the period 2000 through 2023 have increased by approximately $395 million over the April 2000 estimate of $436 million approved by the FERC in a 2000 rate case settlement. The revised estimate reflects the increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, increased security and liability and property insurance costs, and the fact that CYAPC is now self-performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel in July 2003. NU's share of CYAPC's increase in decommissioning and plant closure costs is approximately $194 million. On July 1, 2004, CYAPC filed with the FERC for recovery of these increased costs. In the filing, CYAPC sought to increase its annual decommissioning collections from $16.7 million to $93 million for a six-year period beginning on January 1, 2005. On August 30, 2004, the FERC issued an order accepting the rates, with collection beginning on February 1, 2005 subject to refund, and scheduled hearings for May 2005. In total, NU's estimated remaining decommissioning and plant closure obligation for CYAPC is $308.7 million at December 31, 2004.
On June 10, 2004, the DPUC and Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed a petition seeking a declaratory order that CYAPC be allowed to recover all decommissioning costs from its wholesale purchasers, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, but that such purchasers may not be allowed to recover in their retail rates any costs that the FERC might determine to have been imprudently incurred. On August 30, 2004, the FERC denied this petition. On September 29, 2004, the DPUC and OCC asked the FERC to reconsider the petition. On October 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order granting further consideration regarding the DPUC's and OCC's petition for reconsideration. No hearing date has been established for this reconsideration.
On February 22, 2005, the DPUC filed testimony with the FERC. In its filed testimony, the DPUC argues that approximately $215 million to $225 million of CYAPC's requested increase is due to CYAPC's imprudence in managing the decommissioning project while Bechtel was the contractor. Therefore, the DPUC recommends a total disallowance of between $225 million to $234 million. Hearings are scheduled to begin on June 1, 2005. NU's share of the DPUC's recommended disallowance is between $110 million to $115 million.
On June 23, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC asserting a number of claims and seeking a variety of remedies, including monetary and punitive damages and rescission of the contract. Bechtel has since amended its complaint to add claims for wrongful termination. On August 22, 2003, CYAPC filed its answer and counterclaims, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing. Discovery is currently underway, and a trial has been scheduled for May 2006.
In the prejudgment remedy proceeding before the Connecticut Supreme Court (the Court), Bechtel sought garnishment of the CYAPC decommissioning trust and related payments. In October 2004, Bechtel and CYAPC entered into an agreement under which Bechtel waived its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYAPC's real property in Connecticut and the escrowing of $41.7 million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to CYAPC through June 30, 2007 with respect to CYAPC's common equity. This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be implemented until the Court found that such assets were subject to attachment. CYAPC has contested the attachability of such assets. The DPUC is an intervener in this proceeding.
Management cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding required for the collection of the increased CYAPC decommissioning costs. Management believes that the costs have been prudently incurred and will ultimately be recovered from the customers  of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. However, there is a risk that some portion of these increased costs may not be recovered, or will have to be refunded if recovered, as a result of the FERC proceedings. Management also cannot predict the timing and the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
The Yankee Companies filed litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983  under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act). Under the Act, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) was to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear plants of Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC), Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC) and CYAPC no later than January 31, 1998 in return for payments by each company into the nuclear waste fund. No fuel has been collected by the DOE, and spent nuclear fuel is stored on the sites of the Yankee Companies' plants. YAEC, MYAPC and CYAPC collected the funds for payments into the nuclear waste fund from wholesale utility customers under FERC-approved contract rates. The wholesale utility customers in turn collect these payments from their retail electric customers. The  Yankee Companies' individu al damage claims attributed to the government's breach totaling $548  million are specific to each plant and include incremental storage, security, construction and other costs through 2010, which is the earliest date the DOE projects that it will begin removing nuclear fuel. The YAEC damage claim is $191 million, the MYAPC claim is $160 million and the CYAPC claim is $197 million.
The DOE trial ended on August 31, 2004 and a verdict has not been reached. The current Yankee Companies' rates do not include an amount for recovery of damages in this matter. Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
Business Development and Capital Expenditures
In 2004, NU's capital expenditures totaled $643.8 million, compared with depreciation of $224.9 million. In 2003 and 2002, capital expenditures totaled $563.6 million and $510.5 million, respectively, compared with depreciation of $204.4 million and $205.6 million, respectively. In 2005, capital expenditures are projected to total approximately $740 million, compared with projected depreciation of approximately $240 million. The increasing level of capital expenditures is driven primarily by a need to improve the capacity and reliability of NU's regulated energy delivery system. That increased level of capital expenditures, compared with depreciation levels, also is increasing the amount of plant in service and the regulated companies' earnings base, provided NU's Utility Group companies achieve timely recovery of their investment.
Consolidated:
Utility Group:
: In December 2003, the DPUC approved $900 million of distribution capital expenditures for CL&P from 2004 through 2007. Those expenditures are intended to improve the reliability of the distribution system and to meet growth requirements on the distribution system. In 2004, CL&P's distribution capital expenditures totaled $241.8 million, compared with $258.7 million in 2003 and $219.7 million in 2002. In 2005, CL&P projects distribution capital expenditures of approximately $230 million.
CL&P
CL&P's transmission capital expenditures totaled $128.1 million in 2004, compared with $63.5 million in 2003 and $39.1 million in 2002. In 2005, CL&P's transmission capital expenditures are projected to total approximately $190 million. The primary reason for the increase projected for 2005 is the expectation that construction will increase in the spring of 2005 on a new 21-mile, 345 kV transmission project between Bethel, Connecticut and Norwalk, Connecticut. The CSC initially approved that project in July 2003.
On August 19, 2004, a Connecticut Superior Court judge dismissed an appeal by the City of Norwalk of the permit granted to CL&P by the CSC to construct a 345 kV transmission project from Bethel, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut. Based upon a recently completed estimate, the project is currently projected to cost between $300 million and $350 million. The project is expected to begin to alleviate identified reliability issues in southwest Connecticut and to help offset rising customer costs for all of Connecticut. Work on the related substations has begun, and work on the transmission lines is expected to start in March 2005 after receiving permits from the towns and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The major line construction contracts were signed in early March 2005. Management estimates a project completion date of December 2006. At December 31, 2004, CL&P has capitalized $65 million of costs associa ted with this project.
On October 9, 2003, CL&P and The United Illuminating Company (UI) filed for approval at the CSC for a separate 69-mile 345 kV transmission line from Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut. Construction is expected to commence after the final route and configuration are determined by CSC. CL&P and UI initially estimated a cost of $620 million for the total project. In June 2004, after the New England Independent System  Operator (ISO-NE) raised concerns over the amount of underground line that had been proposed, the CSC requested that a committee comprised of representatives of CL&P, UI and ISO-NE study various alternatives and reach a consensus on the proposed project configuration. The report was filed on December 20, 2004 and recommended a maximum of 24 miles of underground line. On December 28, 2004 CL&P and UI filed updated cost estimates with the CSC which reflect changes needed to address t echnical issues introduced by the extensive amount of underground transmission being proposed and a two-year delay in the project in-service date from 2007 to 2009. The new estimates place the cost of the project between $840 million and $990 million. The variation in the cost range is due to unknown conditions that may be encountered during construction and a provision for other contingencies. Additional steps being considered by the CSC to lower magnetic fields along the overhead portion of the proposed route would add between $70 million and $80 million to the estimated cost. The CSC completed hearings on the proposal and the alternatives on February 17, 2005, and a ruling on the proposed project is expected by April 7, 2005. At December 31, 2004, CL&P has capitalized $18 million associated with this project.
On October 1, 2004, CL&P and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) jointly filed plans with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to replace an undersea 13-mile electric transmission line between Norwalk, Connecticut and Northport - Long Island, New York, consistent with a comprehensive settlement agreement reached on June 24, 2004. This project is estimated to cost in the range of $114 million to $135 million with CL&P and LIPA each owning approximately 50 percent of the line. The cost range reflects that vendor contracts have not yet been signed. The project has received CSC approval, and federal and New York state approvals are expected in 2005. Pending final approval, construction activities are scheduled to begin in the fall of 2006. Management expects the line to be in service by the middle of 2008. At December 31, 2004, CL&P has capitalized $7 million of costs related to this project.
In May 2004, CL&P applied to the CSC to construct two 115 kV 9-mile underground transmission lines between Norwalk, Connecticut and Stamford, Connecticut. The project is expected to cost approximately $120 million and will help meet the growing electric demands in the area. Management expects the lines to be in service by 2008. At December 31, 2004, CL&P has capitalized $3 million of costs related to this project.
During 2004, NU placed in service $123 million of electric transmission projects. These projects included CL&P's $38 million upgrade of a transmission substation in Stamford, Connecticut that will allow additional electricity to be imported into southwest Connecticut.
On September  3, 2004, the DPUC approved the application by Yankee Gas to construct a LNG storage facility in Waterbury, Connecticut, at an expected cost of $108 million that is capable of storing the equivalent of 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas. On October 15, 2004, Yankee Gas signed a contract for the design and building of the facility, which will be filled through both liquefaction of natural gas on-site and the transportation of LNG from off-site locations. Formal groundbreaking for the project occurred on January 27, 2005, and management expects the facility to become operational in time for the 2007/2008 heating season. At December 31, 2004, Yankee Gas has capitalized $12.9 million of costs related to this project.
Yankee Gas:
On November 1, 2004, Yankee Gas placed in service a new nine-mile gas line to connect its system in southeast Connecticut to the New England Gas Company (NEGASCO) system in Rhode Island. The construction project and a 20-year contract between Yankee Gas and NEGASCO were previously approved by the DPUC and related interstate transportation services by the FERC.
In 2004, PSNH's capital expenditures totaled $143.6 million, compared with $105.4 million in 2003 and $107 million in 2002. PSNH's capital expenditures are projected to increase to approximately $150 million in 2005, primarily as a result of the conversion of one of three 50 megawatt units at the coal-fired Schiller Station to burn wood (Northern Wood Power Project). Construction of the $75 million Northern Wood Power Project has begun and is expected to be completed by late 2006. The NHPUC's 2004 approval of the project has been appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court brought by some of New Hampshire's existing wood-fired generating plant owners. Management does not believe that the appeal will negatively affect PSNH's ability to complete the Northern Wood Power Project.
PSNH:
In addition to the Northern Wood Power Project, PSNH's capital spending in 2005 will be driven in part by its agreement in its delivery charge 2004 rate case settlement to invest approximately $60 million annually in its distribution capital improvement program.
In 2004, WMECO's capital expenditures totaled $38.6 million, compared with $33.3 million in 2003 and $26.5 million in 2002. As part of WMECO's rate settlement approved by the DTE on December 29, 2004, WMECO agreed to invest not less than $24 million in capital expenditures in 2005 and 2006 related to reliability improvements. For further information regarding rate matters associated with business development and capital expenditures, see "Utility Group Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters," in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
WMECO:
In 2004, capital expenditures totaled $11.8 million at NGC, $1.5 million at HWP, and $4.3 million at other NU Enterprises businesses. Capital expenditures at NGC in 2004 included the final work on a $25 million project to increase the capacity of the Cabot conventional hydroelectric station in Massachusetts by 9 MW to 62 MW. HWP is evaluating spending approximately $14 million in 2005 and 2006 to meet new Massachusetts clean air requirements without which HWP's Mt. Tom coal-fired generating station would be required to cease operation in October 2006. NGC's capital expenditures in 2005 are projected to total approximately $10 million.
NU Enterprises:
Transmission Access and FERC Regulatory Changes
NU companies CL&P, WMECO and PSNH are members of the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and, since 1997, have provided regional open access transmission service over their combined transmission system under the NEPOOL Open Access Transmission Tariff, which is administered by ISO-NE and local open access transmission service under the NU Companies Open Access Tariff No. 10, which the NU companies administer.
On October 31, 2003, ISO-NE, along with NU and six other New England transmission owning companies, filed a proposal with the FERC to create a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) for New England in compliance with a 1999 FERC order calling on all transmission owners to voluntarily join RTOs (Order 2000). The RTO is intended to strengthen the independent and efficient management of the region's power system while ensuring that customers in New England continue to have highly reliable service and realize the benefits of a competitive wholesale energy market.
In a separate filing made on November 4, 2003, the New England transmission owning companies requested, consistent with the FERC's proposed pricing policy for RTOs, that the FERC approve a single ROE for regional and local transmission service rates that would consist of a proposed 12.8 percent base ROE as well as incentive adders of 0.5 percent for joining a RTO and 1.0 percent for constructing new transmission facilities approved by the RTO.
On March 24, 2004, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the New England RTO proposal but set for hearing the determination of the appropriate base ROE for transmission rates under the RTO and the clarification as to which facilities the 1.0 percent incentive adder should apply. The 0.5 percent ROE adder was accepted for regional rates.
On November 3, 2004, the FERC issued an order that 1) determined that the New England transmission owners' methodology used to calculate the proposed ROE is appropriate, 2) clarified the application of the 0.5 percent incentive adder for joining a RTO for regional assets and reaffirmed the appropriateness of the 1.0 percent incentive adder for new investments; however, it left still unresolved the type of investments to which the 1.0 percent incentive adder should apply, and 3) approved certain compliance items that were required by the FERC's March 24, 2004 order.
While the order approved the methodology that had been proposed by the transmission owners for calculating the base ROE, it determined that the actual base ROE would be determined following the conclusion of an ordered hearing, which commenced on January 25, 2005. As part of the hearing procedures, the New England transmission owners submitted supplemental testimony supporting their ROE proposal on January 10, 2005 that, among other things, updated the ROE calculations submitted with the November filing. The decision on the ROE incentive adders could result in a different ROE being utilized in the calculation of Regional Network Service (RNS) tariffs than the ROE utilized in the calculation of Local Network Service (LNS) tariffs. An initial administrative law judge decision on these issues is expected in May 2005, and a final ruling regarding these issues is expected by the first quarter of 2006.
In January 2005, the New England transmission owners voted affirmatively to approve activation of the RTO, which occurred on February 1, 2005. As of February 1, 2005, transmission rates were adjusted to reflect the ROEs proposed by the New England transmission owners in the original RTO filing (12.8 percent plus the requested 0.5 percent), subject to refund to reflect the ROE resulting from the ultimate outcome of the hearings. Management cannot at this time predict the ultimate ROE that will be determined following the hearings.
Utility Group Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters
Wholesale transmission revenues are based on rates and formulas that are approved by the FERC. Most of NU's wholesale transmission revenues are collected through a combination of the RNS tariff and NU's LNS tariff. NU's LNS tariff is reset on June 1st of each year to coincide with the change in RNS rates. Additionally, NU's LNS tariff provides for a true-up to actual costs, which ensures that NU recovers its total transmission revenue requirements, including the allowed ROE. Through December 31, 2004, this true-up has resulted in the recognition of a $4.6 million regulatory liability for refund to electric distribution companies, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.
Transmission:
On June 14, 2004, the transmission segment reached a settlement agreement with the parties to its rate case, which allows NU to implement formula-based rates as proposed with an allowed ROE of 11.0 percent. On September 16, 2004, the FERC approved the settlement agreement. The retroactive impact of the change in ROE from 11.75 percent to 11.0 percent reduced earnings by $1 million and $0.1 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Effective February 1, 2005, the 11.0 percent ROE was increased to the aforementioned 12.8 percent ROE.
On February 1, 2005, consistent with its tariff, NU's transmission segment implemented an increase to its transmission tariff that is expected to increase 2005 revenues by approximately $8 million over 2004 transmission revenues.
A significant portion of NU's transmission businesses' revenue is from charges to NU's electric distribution companies CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. These companies recover transmission charges through rates charged to their retail customers. WMECO has a rate tracking mechanism to track transmission costs charged in distribution rates to the actual amount of transmission charges incurred. The 2004 rates set in the CL&P distribution rate case contained a level of transmission revenue sufficient to recover CL&P's 2004 transmission costs. On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P is incurring as of February 1, 2005. The June 1, 2005 PSNH retail rate increase includes revenues to recover expected transmission costs. Neither CL&P nor PSNH currently have tr ansmission rate tracking mechanisms that track transmission costs.
In March 2004, ISO-NE filed a proposal at the FERC to implement locational installed capacity (LICAP) requirements. LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation asset capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a reserve margin and a cushion. In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology. The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings. Hearings began at the end of February 2005. A FERC decision is anticipated in the fall of 2005. Management cannot at this time predict the outcome of this FERC proceeding.
LICAP:
CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will incur LICAP charges. Because southwest Connecticut is a constrained area with insufficient generation assets, CL&P could incur LICAP costs totaling several hundred million dollars. These costs would be recovered from CL&P's customers through the
FMCC mechanism. PSNH and WMECO will also recover these costs from customers.
Connecticut  CL&P:
: On June 25, 2003, the Governor of Connecticut signed into law Public Act No. 03-135 (the Act) which amended Connecticut's 1998 electric utility industry legislation. The Act required CL&P to file a four-year transmission and distribution plan with the DPUC.  On December 17, 2003, the DPUC issued its final decision in the rate case.
Public Act No. 03-135 and Rate Proceedings
CL&P filed a petition for reconsideration of certain items in the final decision on December 31, 2003. The DPUC issued a final decision on the petition on August 4, 2004. The final decision authorized CL&P to use existing CTA overrecoveries in lieu of an increase in rates to recover approximately $24 million, which is the net present value of the $32 million sought in the reconsideration. The final decision had a 2004 positive pre-tax impact of $11.5 million ($6.9 million after-tax) on CL&P. The remaining amount of $12.5 million is being amortized over four years beginning August 1, 2004 as an increase to revenues as the related costs to be recovered are incurred.
Under the Act, CL&P is allowed to collect a fixed procurement fee of 0.50 mills per kWh from customers who purchase TSO. One mill is equal to one-tenth of a cent. That fee can increase to 0.75 mills if CL&P outperforms certain regional benchmarks. The fixed portion of the procurement fee amounted to approximately $12 million (approximately $7 million after-tax) for 2004. On September 15, 2004, CL&P submitted to the DPUC its proposed methodology to calculate the variable portion (incentive portion) of the procurement fee. On November 18, 2004 the DPUC suspended this proceeding and has not indicated when the schedule will be resumed. The variable portion of the procurement fee has not yet been reflected in earnings.
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P is incurring as of February 1, 2005. If the DPUC does not approve this deferral, CL&P's application provides for an alternate proposal to increase its retail transmission rate to recover an additional $7.6 million on an annual basis, effective February 1, 2005. Under this proposal the increase would equal $0.00031 per kWh, and would represent approximately a 0.2 percent increase in overall rates as of February 1, 2005. Hearings in this docket have not been scheduled.
Retail Transmission Rate Filing:
: The CTA allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and independent power producer (IPP) over market costs, while the SBC allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2004, CL&P filed its 2003 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the DPUC, which compares CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements. A final decision in the 2003 CTA and SBC docket was issued on August 4, 2004 and ordered a refund to customers of $88.5 million over a seven-month period beginning with October 2004 consumption.
In the 2001 CTA and SBC reconciliation filing, and subsequently in a September 10, 2002 petition to reopen related proceedings, CL&P requested that a deferred intercompany tax liability associated with the intercompany sale of generation assets be excluded from the calculation of CTA revenue requirements. On September 10, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision denying CL&P's request, and on October 24, 2003, CL&P appealed the DPUC's final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court. The appeal has been fully briefed and argued. A decision from the court is not expected to be issued until the second quarter of 2005. If CL&P's request is granted through these  court proceedings, then there could be additional amounts due to CL&P from its customers. The 2004 impact of including the deferred intercompany tax liability in CTA revenue requirements has been a reduction in revenue of approximate ly $19 million.
On September 9, 2004, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC requesting approval to issue long- term debt in the amount of $600 million during the period February 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007. Additionally, CL&P requested approval to enter into hedging transactions from time to time through December 31, 2007 in connection with any prospective or outstanding long-term debt in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the debt or debt issuances. A final decision from the DPUC was issued on January 26, 2005. The final decision approved CL&P's request to issue $600 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2007. Additionally, the final decision approved CL&P's request to enter into hedging transactions in connection with any prospective or outstanding long-term debt in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the debt or debt issuances. CL&P plans to issue up to $200 million in long-term debt by the middle of 2005.
Application for Issuance of Long-Term Debt:
The vast majority of CL&P's customers buy their energy through CL&P's TSO, rather than buying energy directly from competitive suppliers. On August 1, 2003, CL&P filed with the DPUC to establish TSO rates equal to December 31, 1996 total rate levels. In October 2003, CL&P requested bids from wholesale energy marketers to supply its TSO requirements from 2004 through 2006. Five wholesale marketers supplied CL&P's TSO requirements in 2004, including Select Energy. On December 19, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision setting the average TSO rate of $0.1076 per kWh effective January 1, 2004. In November 2004, CL&P requested bids from wholesale marketers to supply the TSO requirements in 2005 and 2006 that were not filled in the 2003 solicitation. Due to higher energy prices, the bids received and accepted by CL&P were significantly higher than those accepted in 2003. As a result of the higher supply costs, higher FMCC and a $25.1 million distribution rate increase approved by the DPUC in CL&P's rate case, on November 24, 2004, CL&P requested the DPUC to increase its TSO rate by 16.7 percent in 2005. On December 22, 2004, the DPUC approved the increase of 16.2 percent effective January 1, 2005, although the impact was partially offset by a continuation of the CTA refund. The DPUC also ordered that projected 2004 and 2005 CTA overrecoveries and half of projected 2004 distribution overrecoveries be used to moderate increases for customers that otherwise would occur when the current CTA refund expires on May 1, 2005. Overall, the final decision approved an increase to the January 2004 TSO rates of approximately 10.4 percent, including the effects of existing and new refunds and overrecoveries. The DPUC denied requests by the Connecticut Attorney General and OCC to defer the recovery of higher supplier costs into future years. On February 3, 2005, the OC C filed an appeal with the Connecticut Superior Court challenging this decision. This appeal is identical to the appeal filed with the same court in February 2004 challenging the DPUC's December 2003 decision. Management believes that this appeal will not impact the DPUC's December 22, 2004 order.
CL&P TSO Rates:
Also, pursuant to state law, on December 19, 2003, the DPUC set CL&P's TSO rates for January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and confirmed that state law exempted FMCC, Energy Adjustment Clause (EAC) charges and certain other charges from the statutorily imposed rate cap. The OCC filed appeals of this decision with the Connecticut Superior Court. The OCC claims that the decision improperly implements an EAC charge under Connecticut law, fails to properly define and identify the fees that CL&P will be allowed to collect from customers and improperly calculates base rates for purposes of determining the rate cap. Management believes that these appeals will not impact the TSO rates approved by the DPUC.
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed for a 1.6 percent increase to rates ($29.2 million) to collect additional FMCC from customers effective May 1, 2005. The increase is necessary to collect costs related to an additional RMR contract related to two generating plants located in southwest Connecticut. The RMR contract has preliminary approval for billing from the FERC and is subject to a future review by the FERC prior to final approval.
Connecticut  Yankee Gas:
: On July 2, 2004, Yankee Gas filed a rate case with the DPUC to increase retail rates by $26.5 million, or 7.2 percent, effective January 1, 2005. Yankee Gas also requested an authorized ROE of 10.75 percent in the rate case filing. The requested increase in rates was based on increased costs of distribution delivery services such as pension and healthcare, as well as the cost of additional investments needed to maintain a safe and reliable gas distribution system.
Rate Case Filing
On October 14, 2004, Yankee Gas filed a settlement agreement with the DPUC. Parties to the settlement agreement included the OCC and the Prosecutorial Division of the DPUC. The settlement agreement increases customer rates by $14 million annually, allows a ROE of 9.9 percent and reduces Yankee Gas' annual expense for plant taken out of service by $5.7 million. As part of the settlement agreement, Yankee Gas agreed not to file a new rate increase application to be effective prior to the earlier of the in-service date of its new LNG facility or July 1, 2007. On December 8, 2004, the DPUC issued a final decision approving the settlement agreement as filed. The rate increase took effect on January 1, 2005.
New Hampshire:
PSNH's delivery rates were fixed, effective May 1, 2001, by the "Agreement to Settle PSNH Restructuring" (Restructuring Settlement) until February 1, 2004. Consistent with the requirements of the Restructuring Settlement and state law, PSNH filed a delivery service rate case and tariffs with the NHPUC on December 29, 2003 to increase electricity delivery rates by approximately $21 million, or 2.6 percent, effective February 1, 2004.
Delivery Rate Case:
On July 14, 2004, PSNH filed with the NHPUC a revenue requirements settlement agreement among several parties, including the NHPUC staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA). The terms of the proposed settlement agreement allowed for increases in PSNH's delivery rates totaling $3.5 million annually, effective prospectively beginning October 1, 2004, and an incremental $10 million annual increase effective prospectively on June 1, 2005, for a total rate increase of $13.5 million. On July 29, 2004, PSNH filed with the NHPUC a rate design settlement agreement among several parties, including the NHPUC staff. These proposed revenue requirements and rate design settlement agreements together resolved all delivery service rate case issues. On September 2, 2004, the NHPUC issued an order approving both settlement agreements, and new delivery service rates went into effect on October 1, 2004.
e: In accordance with the Restructuring Settlement and state law, PSNH files for updated TS/DS rates periodically to ensure timely recovery of its costs. The TS/DS rate recovers PSNH's generation and purchased power costs, including a return on PSNH's generation investment. PSNH defers for future recovery or refund any difference between its TS/DS revenues and the actual costs incurred.
Transition Energy Service and Default Energy Servic
On September 24, 2004, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting a change in the TS/DS rate for the period February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006. In December 2004, PSNH petitioned for a TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh based on updated market information. The NHPUC issued its order approving a TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh on January 28, 2005. This TS/DS rate includes an 11 percent ROE on PSNH's generation assets, which is subject to further review by the NHPUC.
The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs. On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year. This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues billed with stranded costs, and TS/DS revenues billed with TS/DS costs. The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of PSNH's generation operations. The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $208.6 million at December 31, 2004. This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of nonsecuritized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $411.3 million to $202.7 million.
SCRC Reconciliation Filings:
The 2003 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on April 30, 2004, and a stipulation and settlement agreement between PSNH, the  OCA and NHPUC staff was filed with the NHPUC on October 4, 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, no costs related to the recovery of stranded costs or the cost of providing transition energy service were disallowed, and the NHPUC staff agreed to accept the 2003 SCRC filing without change. On October 29, 2004, the NHPUC issued an order accepting the settlement agreement as filed.
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing is expected to be filed with the NHPUC by May 2, 2005. Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis. On May 2, 2005, PSNH expects to file its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation that will include a request to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process. This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting. At December 31, 2004, the PSNH unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively. If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs. Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
PSNH is planning to file a wholesale distribution rate case with the FERC in late March 2005. This FERC filing is necessary due to the reclassification of certain assets from PSNH's transmission business to distribution business. PSNH plans to file a revenue requirements analysis in order to recover certain delivery costs arising from the provision of wholesale delivery service to another New Hampshire utility.
Wholesale Distribution Rate Case:
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2004, WMECO filed its 2003 transition cost reconciliation with the DTE. This filing reconciled the recovery of generation-related stranded costs for calendar year 2003. The DTE has not initiated its investigation into this filing. WMECO expects to file its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the DTE on March 31, 2005. The DTE combined the 2003 transition cost reconciliation filing and the  2004 transition cost reconciliation filing into a single proceeding. The timing of this decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, but management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.
Transition Cost Reconciliation:
On December 29, 2004, the DTE approved a rate case settlement agreement submitted by WMECO, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, and the Low-Income Energy Affordability Network. The settlement agreement provides for a $6 million increase in WMECO's distribution rate effective January 1, 2005 and an additional $3 million increase in WMECO's distribution rate effective January 1, 2006 and for a decrease in WMECO's transition charge by approximately $13 million annually. The lower transition charge will delay recovery of transition costs and will reduce WMECO's cash flow but not its earnings as part of the rate case settlement. WMECO agreed not to file a full rate case with rates effective prior to January 1, 2007.
Distribution Rate Case Settlement Agreement:
NU Enterprises
NU Enterprises aligns its businesses into two business segments: the merchant energy business segment and the energy services and other business segment. The merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing businesses. Also currently included in the merchant energy segment are 1,443 MW of generation assets, including 1,296 MW of pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets at NGC and 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets at HWP. The wholesale business primarily serves full requirements sales to LDCs and bilateral sales to other load serving counterparties. To serve these customers, Select Energy relies on its own generation and an inventory of energy contracts.
Business Segments:
The energy services business segment includes the operations of SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, NGS, including Boulos and Wood Electrical, and Woods Network. SESI performs energy management services for large commercial customers, institutional facilities and the United States government and energy-related construction services.  SECI provides mechanical and electrical contracting services for new construction and service contracts.  Reeds Ferry purchases equipment on behalf of SECI.  NGS operates and maintains NGC's and HWP's generation assets and provides third-party electrical services. Woods Network is a network design, products and services company.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.
NU Enterprises lost $15.1 million in 2004. This loss includes a $48.3 million mark-to-market loss associated with certain wholesale natural gas positions. In 2003, NU Enterprises lost $3.4 million. This loss includes a $35.6 million charge associated with SMD. NU Enterprises' merchant energy retail marketing business earnings improved to net income of $4.9 million in 2004, compared with a loss of $1.8 million in 2003.
Results:
NU Enterprises' energy services, parent and other businesses lost $3 million in 2004 compared with earnings of approximately $2.1 million in 2003. The 2004 earnings decrease is the result of losses recorded on a major construction contract.
On March 9, 2005, NU completed its previously announced comprehensive review of its competitive energy businesses and decided that NU Enterprises will exit the wholesale marketing business. NU also concluded that NU Enterprises' energy services businesses are not central to NU's long-term strategy and do not meet the company's expectations of profitability. As a result, the company will explore ways to divest those businesses in a manner that maximizes their value. NU will retain its competitive generation and retail energy marketing businesses because it believes that the generation assets and retail business are competitively positioned to create significant opportunities for those businesses over the next several years.
Outlook:
NU Enterprises' 2005 earnings will be impacted by many factors, including the amount of asset impairments or losses on disposals that could result from the decision to explore divesting the services segment, the mark-to-market loss that may result from the application of mark-to-market accounting to certain wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are sold or until the commodities are delivered, and other closure costs.
CL&P's standard offer purchases from Select Energy represented $502 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $558 million during the same period in 2003. Other energy purchases between CL&P and Select Energy totaled $109.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $130 million during the same period in 2003. Additionally, WMECO's purchases from Select Energy represented $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $143 million during the same period in 2003. These amounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Intercompany Transactions:
NU Enterprises' Market and Other Risks
The decision to exit the wholesale marketing business will change the risk profile of NU Enterprises in 2005. Subsequent to the sale of the wholesale marketing business, NU Enterprises will continue to be exposed to certain market risks; however, management believes that those risks will be reduced. The merchant energy business segment will be comprised of generation assets and the retail marketing segment, which will enter into contracts of varying lengths of time to buy and sell energy commodities, including electricity, natural gas, and oil to retail customers. Market risk represents the loss that may affect the merchant energy business segment's financial results, primarily Select Energy, due to adverse changes in commodity market prices.
Overview:
Risk management within Select Energy has been organized to address the market, credit and operational exposures arising from the merchant energy business segment. The framework for managing these risks is set forth in NU's risk management policies and procedures, which are reviewed by the NU Board of Trustees on an as needed basis.
A significant portion of Select Energy's merchant energy marketing activities has been providing electricity to full requirements customers, which are primarily regulated LDCs and commercial and industrial retail customers. Under the terms of full requirements contracts, Select Energy is required to provide a percentage of the LDC's electricity requirements at all times. The volumes sold under these contracts vary based on the usage of the LDC's retail electric customers, and usage is dependent upon factors outside of Select Energy's control, such as the weather. The varying sales volumes could be different than the supply volumes that Select Energy expected to utilize, either from its limited generation or from electricity purchase contracts, to serve the full requirements contracts. Differences between actual sales volumes and supply volumes can require Select Energy to purchase additional electricity or sell excess electricity, both of which are subject to market conditions such as weather, plant availability, transmission congestion, and potentially volatile price fluctuations that can impact prices and, in turn, Select Energy's margins.
The pricing terms of full requirement contracts and of supply contracts can affect the timing of Select Energy's margins. Many full requirements contracts have higher prices in certain months, while many supply contracts have one price for the entire contract term. Accordingly, Select Energy's margins will tend to be higher in the months when the full requirements contract price is higher and lower or could be negative when the full requirements contract price is lower.
In June 2004, Select Energy began purchasing fixed-price electricity and some electricity with prices indexed to gas for 2005 and 2006 in anticipation of winning full requirements contract sales and sales to load-serving entities. Purchasing electricity in advance creates the risk of electricity price decreases before the full requirement quantities are contracted and before contract prices are known.
To mitigate the risk of electricity price decreases on the fixed-price electricity that was purchased, Select Energy in June 2004 began selling wholesale natural gas contracts for 2005 and 2006. The intended result of this risk mitigation strategy was that decreases in the value of the fixed-price electricity purchase contracts would be offset in part by increases in the value of the gas contracts, and vice versa. Select Energy intended to purchase natural gas when quantities and prices of electricity are secured by full requirements contracts or sales contracts with load-serving entities. Natural gas was sold in this risk mitigation strategy due to the high liquidity of the natural gas market compared to the low liquidity of electricity in New England.
The electricity contracts were accounted for on the accrual basis through 2004, which would have resulted in earnings recognition when the electricity would have been delivered to customers in 2005 and 2006. These electricity purchase contracts were to be used to meet electricity sales contract requirements, which was a key component of the merchant energy wholesale business. Until the decision to cease wholesale marketing activities was made, management believed that this electricity would be delivered to its customers. The decision on March 9, 2005 to exit the wholesale marketing business changed management's conclusion regarding the likelihood that many wholesale marketing contracts would result in delivery to customers. This in turn resulted in a change in March 2005 from accrual accounting to fair value accounting for the wholesale marketing contracts that will be sold. Under fair value accounting, changes in the fa ir value of these contracts will impact 2005 earnings until the contracts are completed or sold.
The natural gas contracts are recorded at current fair value with changes in fair value impacting earnings. At December 31, 2004 the fair value of the natural gas contracts was a negative $77.7 million. The changes in fair values totaling a negative $77.7 million increased fuel, purchased and net interchange power in 2004. Of the total fair value of negative $77.7 million, approximately negative $68 million relates to 2005 with approximately negative $10 million related to 2006.
The use of fair value accounting for the aforementioned natural gas and electricity contracts has exposed and will continue to expose Select Energy's and NU's earnings to future changes in natural gas and electricity prices, which could be significant. This has and can reasonably be expected to create uncertainty in 2005 regarding Select Energy's and NU's earnings and earnings trends.
The natural gas contracts are included in non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in the table in Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the consolidated financial statements.
 Select Energy manages its portfolio of retail marketing contracts to maximize value while operating within NU's corporate risk tolerance. Select Energy generally acquires retail customers in small increments, which while requiring careful sourcing allows energy purchases to be acquired in small increments with low risk. However, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
Retail Marketing Activities:
The generation assets, either owned by NU Enterprises or contracted with third parties, are subject to certain operational risks, including but not limited to the length of scheduled and non-scheduled outages, bidding and scheduling with various ISOs, environmental issues and fuel costs. Generation is also subject to various federal, state and local regulations. These risks may result in changes in the anticipated gross margins which Select Energy realizes from its generation portfolio/activities.
Generation Activities:
For information on derivatives used for hedging purposes and non-trading derivatives, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the consolidated financial statements.
Hedging and Other Non-Trading:
Historically, energy trading transactions at Select Energy include financial transactions and physical delivery transactions for electricity, natural gas and oil in which Select Energy attempted to profit from changes in market prices. Energy trading contracts are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value affect net income.
Wholesale Contracts Defined as "Energy Trading":
At December 31, 2004, Select Energy had trading derivative assets and trading derivative liabilities as follows:
There can be no assurances that Select Energy will realize cash corresponding to the present positive net fair value of its trading positions. Numerous factors could either positively or negatively affect the realization of the net fair value amount in cash. These include the sales price to be received on the sale of these contracts, the volatility of commodity prices until the contracts are sold, the outcome of future transactions, the performance of counterparties, and other factors.
Select Energy has policies and procedures requiring all trading positions to be marked-to-market at the end of each business day and segregating responsibilities between the individuals actually trading (front office) and those confirming the trades (middle office). The determination of the  portfolio's fair value is the responsibility of the middle office independent from the front office.
The methods used to determine the fair value of energy trading contracts are identified and segregated in the table of fair value of contracts at December 31, 2004. A description of each method is as follows: 1) prices actively quoted primarily represent New York Mercantile Exchange futures and options that are marked to closing exchange prices; and 2) prices provided by external sources primarily include over-the-counter forwards and options, including bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, and are marked to the mid-point of bid and ask market prices. Currently, Select Energy has one contract for which a portion of the contract's fair value is determined based on a model or other valuation method. The model utilizes natural gas prices and a conversion factor to electricity. Management recorded a modeling reserve to reduce the value of the contract for those years that do not have liq uid prices to zero. Broker quotes for electricity at locations that Select Energy has entered into
deals are available through the year 2007. For all natural gas positions, broker quotes extend through 2013.
Generally, valuations of short-term contracts derived from quotes or other external sources are more reliable should there be a need to liquidate the contracts , while valuations for longer-term contracts are less certain. Accordingly, there is a risk that contracts will not be realized at the amounts recorded. However, Select Energy has obtained corresponding purchase or sale contracts for a large portion of the trading contracts that have maturities in excess of one year.
Because these trading contracts are sourced, changes in the value of these contracts due to fluctuations in commodity prices are not expected to significantly affect Select Energy's earnings.
As of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the sources of the fair value of trading contracts and the changes in fair value of these trading contracts are included in the following tables. Intercompany transactions are eliminated and not reflected in the amounts below.
The fair value of energy trading contracts decreased to $29.6 million at December 31, 2004 from $32.5 million at December 31, 2003. The change in the fair value of the trading portfolio is primarily attributable to contracts being settled in 2004, offset by changes in the fair value of contracts. The change in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions of $2.3 million in 2003 resulted from a change in the discount rate management uses to determine the fair value of trading contracts. In the second quarter of 2003, the rate was changed from a fixed rate of 5 percent to a market-based LIBOR discount rate to better reflect current market conditions.

In general, the market for energy products has become shorter term in nature with less liquidity, market pricing information is less readily available and participants are sometimes unable to meet Select Energy's credit standards without providing cash or LOC support. Select Energy is being adversely affected by these factors, and there could be a continuing adverse impact on Select Energy's business.
Changing Market:
In addition, NU Enterprises has concluded that competition has increased significantly in the wholesale power market in New England over the last six months of 2004. This increase in competition may affect Select Energy's profitability by reducing the number of bids won and by reducing the margins on those bids which are won.
Changes are occurring in the administration of transmission systems in territories in which Select Energy does business. As the market continues to evolve, there could be additional challenges or opportunities that management cannot determine at this time.
In March 2004, ISO-NE filed a proposal at the FERC to implement LICAP requirements. LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation asset capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a reserve margin and a cushion. In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology. The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings. Hearings began at the end of February 2005. A FERC decision is anticipated in the fall of 2005. Management cannot at this time predict the outcome of this FERC proceeding.
Depending on the pricing curves that are ultimately implemented LICAP could produce significant benefits for generation assets either owned or leased by NU Enterprises. NU Enterprises owned or leased approximately 300 MW of generation assets in Connecticut and approximately 1,300 MW of generation assets in western Massachusetts.
Counterparty credit risk relates to the risk of loss that Select Energy would incur because of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. Select Energy was established written credit policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk. These policies require an evaluation of potential counterparties' financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances (including cash advances, LOCs, and parent guarantees), and the use of standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. This evaluation results in establishing credit limits prior to Select Energy's entering into contracts. The appropriateness of these limits is subject to continuing review. Concentrations among these counterparties may affect Select Energy's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes to economic, regulatory or other conditions. At December 31, 2004, approximately 77 percent of Select Energy's counterparty credit exposure to wholesale and trading counterparties was collateralized or rated BBB- or better. Select Energy was provided $57.7 million and $46.5 million of counterparty deposits at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. For further information, see Note 1Y, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Counterparty Deposits," to the consolidated financial statements.
Counterparty Credit:
A number of Select Energy's contracts require the posting of additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs in the event NU's ratings were to decline and in increasing amounts dependent upon the severity of the decline. At NU's present investment grade ratings, Select Energy has not had to post any collateral based on credit downgrades. Were NU's unsecured ratings to decline two levels to sub-investment grade, Select Energy could, under its present contracts, be asked to provide at December 31, 2004 approximately $361 million of collateral or LOCs to various unaffiliated counterparties and approximately $140 million to several independent system operators and unaffiliated LDCs, which management believes NU would currently be able to provide, subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) limits. NU's credit ratings outlooks are currently stable or negati ve, but management does not believe that at this time there is a significant risk of a ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade levels.
Select Energy's Credit:
Consolidated Edison, Inc. Merger Litigation
On March 5, 2001, Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) advised NU that it was unwilling to close its merger with NU on the terms set forth in the parties' 1999 merger agreement (Merger Agreement). On March 12, 2001, NU filed suit against Con Edison seeking damages in excess of $1 billion.
On May 11, 2001, Con Edison filed an amended complaint seeking damages for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation in an unspecified amount, but which Con Edison's Chief Financial Officer has testified is at least $314 million. NU disputes both Con Edison's entitlement to any damages as well as its method of computing its alleged damages.
The companies completed discovery in the litigation and submitted cross motions for summary judgment. The court denied Con Edison's motion in its entirety, leaving intact NU's claim for breach of the Merger Agreement, and partially granted NU's motion for summary judgment by eliminating Con Edison's claims against NU for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
An intervener in this litigation has made the claim that NU shareholders at March 5, 2001 are entitled to damages from Con Edison, if any, and not current NU shareholders.
Appeals on this and other issues are now pending and no trial date has been set. At this stage of the litigation, management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate effect on NU.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The CL&P Receivables Corporation (CRC) was incorporated on September 5, 1997, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of CL&P. CRC has an agreement with CL&P to purchase and has an arrangement with a highly-rated financial institution under which CRC can sell up to $100 million of an undivided interest in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, CRC had sold an undivided interest in its accounts receivable and unbilled revenues of $90 million and $80 million, respectively, to that financial institution with limited recourse.
Utility Group:
CRC was established for the sole purpose of selling CL&P's accounts receivable and unbilled revenues and is included in the consolidated NU financial statements. On July 7, 2004, CRC renewed its Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement with CL&P and the financial institution through July 6, 2005, and the termination date of the facility was extended to July 3, 2007. Management plans to renew this agreement prior to its expiration. CL&P's continuing involvement with the receivables that are sold to CRC and the financial institution is limited to the servicing of those receivables.
The transfer of receivables to the financial institution under this arrangement qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140. Accordingly, the $90 million and $80 million outstanding under this facility are not reflected as debt or included in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
This off-balance sheet arrangement is not significant to NU's liquidity or other benefits. There are no known events, demands, commitments, trends, or uncertainties that will, or are reasonably likely to, result in the termination, or material reduction in the amount available to the company under this off-balance sheet arrangement.
During 2001, SESI created HEC/CJTS which is a special purpose entity (SPE). SESI created HEC/CJTS for the sole purpose of providing a bankruptcy remote entity for the financing of a construction project. The construction project was the construction of an energy center to serve the Connecticut Juvenile Training School (CJTS). The owner of CJTS, the State of Connecticut, entered into a 30-year lease with HEC/CJTS for the energy center. Simultaneously, HEC/CJTS transferred its interest in the lease with the State of Connecticut to investors who are unaffiliated with NU in exchange for the issuance of $19.2 million of Certificates of Participation. The transfer of HEC /CJTS's interest in the lease was accounted for as a sale under SFAS No. 140. The debt of $19.2 million created in relation to the transfer of interest and issuance of the Certificates of Participation was derecognized and is not reflect ed as debt or included in the consolidated financial statements. No gain or loss was recorded. HEC/CJTS does not provide any guarantees or on-going services, and there are no contingencies related to
NU Enterprises:
this arrangement.
SESI has a separate contract with the State of Connecticut to operate and maintain the energy center. The transaction was structured in this manner to obtain tax-exempt rate financing and therefore to reduce the State of Connecticut's lease payments.
This off-balance sheet arrangement is not significant to NU's liquidity, capital resources or other benefits. There are no known events, demands, commitments, trends, or uncertainties that will, or are reasonably likely to, result in the termination of this off-balance sheet arrangement.
SESI entered into a master purchase agreement with an unaffiliated third party on April 30, 2002 under which SESI may sell certain receivables that are due or become due under delivery orders issued pursuant to federal energy savings performance contracts. At December 31, 2004, SESI had sold $30 million of receivables related to the installation of the energy efficiency projects under this arrangement. The transfer of receivables to the unaffiliated third party under this arrangement qualified as a sale under SFAS No. 140. Accordingly, the $30 million sold at December 31, 2004 is not included as debt in the consolidated financial statements. Under the delivery order with the United States government, SESI is responsible for on-going maintenance and other services related to the energy efficiency project installation. SESI receives payment for those services in addition to the amounts sold under the master purchase agreement.< /P>
SESI has entered into assignment agreements to sell an additional $26.5 million of receivables. This sale will be complete upon customer acceptance of the project installation. Until construction is completed, the advances under the purchase agreement are included in long-term debt in the consolidated financial statements.
This off-balance sheet arrangement is not significant to NU's liquidity or other benefits. There are no known events, demands, commitments, trends, or uncertainties that will, or are reasonably likely to, result in the termination, or material reduction in the amount sold under this off-balance sheet arrangement.
NU's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 present the operations for SESI, including HEC/CJTS, as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation.  For further information regarding this revision, see Note 17, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and at times difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements of NU. Management communicates to and discusses with NU's Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees all critical accounting policies and estimates. The following are the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical in nature.
In accordance with current accounting pronouncements, NU's consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries upon which control is maintained and all variable interest entities (VIE) for which NU is the primary beneficiary, as defined. Determining whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is subjective and requires management's judgment. There are certain variables taken into consideration to determine whether the company is considered the primary beneficiary to the VIE. A change in any one of these variables could require the company to reconsider whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. All intercompany transactions between these subsidiaries are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Presentation:
NU has less than 50 percent ownership interests in CYAPC, YAEC, MYAPC, and two companies that transmit electricity imported from the Hydro-Quebec system. NU does not control these companies and does not consolidate them in its financial statements. NU accounts for the investments in these companies using the equity method. Under the equity method, NU records its ownership share of the earnings or losses at these companies. Determining whether or not NU should apply the equity method of accounting for an investment requires management judgment.
NU had a preferred stock investment in R. M. Services, Inc. (RMS). Upon adoption of FIN 46, management determined that NU was the primary beneficiary of RMS and subsequently consolidated RMS into its financial statements. The consolidation of RMS resulted in a negative $4.7 million after-tax cumulative effect of an accounting change in the third quarter of 2003. On June 30, 2004, the assets and liabilities of RMS were sold. For more information on RMS, see Note 1I, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Accounting for R.M. Services, Inc." to the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FIN 46 (FIN 46R). FIN 46R has resulted in fewer NU investments meeting the definition of a VIE. FIN 46R was effective for NU for the first quarter of 2004 and did not have an impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Utility Group retail revenues are based on rates approved by the state regulatory commissions. These regulated rates are applied to customers' use of energy to calculate a bill. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions.
Revenue Recognition:
The determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and an estimated amount of unbilled revenues is recorded.
Certain Utility Group companies utilize regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms to track the recovery of certain incurred costs. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically, with overcollections refunded to customers or underrecollections collected from customers in future periods.
Wholesale transmission revenues are based on rates and formulas that are approved by the FERC. Most of NU's wholesale transmission revenues are collected through a combination of the RNS tariff and NU's LNS tariff. The RNS tariff, which is administered by ISO-NE, recovers the revenue requirements associated with transmission facilities that are deemed by the FERC to be Pool Transmission Facilities. The LNS tariff, which was accepted by the FERC on October 22, 2003, provides for the recovery of NU's total transmission revenue requirements, net of revenue credits received from various rate components, including revenues received under the RNS rates.
NU Enterprises recognizes revenues at different times for its different business lines. Wholesale and retail marketing revenues are recognized when energy is delivered to customers. Trading revenues are typically recognized as the fair value of trading contracts changes. Service revenues are recognized as services are provided, often on a percentage of completion basis.
Revenues and expenses for derivative contracts that are entered into for trading purposes are recorded on a net basis in revenues when these transactions settle. The settlement of wholesale non-trading derivative contracts for the sale of energy or gas by both the Utility Group and NU Enterprises that are related to customers' needs are recorded in operating expenses. Derivative contracts that hedge an underlying transaction and that qualify for hedge accounting affect earnings when the forecasted transaction being hedged occurs, when hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recorded, when the forecasted transaction being hedged is no longer probable of occurring, or when there is an accumulated other comprehensive loss and when the hedge and the forecasted transaction being hedged are in a loss position on a combined basis. The settlement of hedge derivative contracts is recorded in the same revenue or expense line as the transaction being hedged. For further information regarding the accounting for these contracts, see Note 1F, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Derivative Accounting," to the consolidated financial statements.
Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or gas delivered to customers that has not been billed. Unbilled revenues represent assets on the balance sheet that become accounts receivable in the following month as customers are billed.
Utility Group Unbilled Revenues:
The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. Estimating the impact of these factors is complex and requires management's judgment. The estimate of unbilled revenues is important to NU's consolidated financial statements as adjustments to that estimate could significantly impact operating revenues and earnings.
The Utility Group currently estimates unbilled revenues monthly using the requirements method. The requirements method utilizes the total monthly volume of electricity or gas delivered to the system and applies a delivery efficiency (DE) factor to reduce the total monthly volume by an estimate of delivery losses in order to calculate total estimated monthly sales to customers. The total estimated monthly sales amount less total monthly billed sales amount results in a monthly estimate of unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average rate to the estimate of unbilled sales. The estimated DE factor can have a significant impact on estimated unbilled revenue amounts.
During 2004 the unbilled sales estimates for all Utility Group companies were tested using the cycle method. The cycle method uses the billed sales from each meter reading cycle and an estimate of unbilled days in each month based on the meter reading schedule. The cycle method is historically more accurate than the requirements method when used in a mostly weather-neutral month. The cycle method testing was performed in the second and fourth quarters of 2004 but did not have a material impact on earnings.
During 2003 the cycle method resulted in adjustments to the estimate of unbilled revenues that had a net positive after-tax earnings impact of approximately $4.6 million. The 2003 positive after-tax impacts on CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO were $7.2 million, $3.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. There was a negative after-tax impact on Yankee Gas of $6.2 million, including certain gas cost adjustments.
Effective January 1, 2001, NU adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
Derivative Accounting:
Most of the contracts comprising Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing activities are derivatives, and many Utility Group contracts for the purchase or sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives. The application of derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: election and designation of the normal purchases and sales exception, identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, identifying hedge relationships, assessing and measuring hedge ineffectiveness, and determining the fair value of derivatives. All of these judgments, depending upon their timing and effect, can have a significant impact on NU's consolidated net income.
The judgment applied in the election of the normal purchases and sales exception (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusions that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then the normal exception and accrual accounting would be terminated and fair value accounting would be applied. Cash flow hedge contracts that are designated as hedges for contracts for which the company has elected the normal purchases and sales exception can continue to be accounted for as cash flow hedges only if the normal exception for the hedged contract continues to be appropriate. If the normal exception is terminated, then the hedge designation would be term inated at the same time.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amended existing derivative accounting guidance. This new statement incorporates interpretations that were included in previous Derivative Implementation Group (DIG) guidance, clarifies certain conditions, and amends other existing pronouncements. It was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Management has determined that the adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not change NU's accounting for wholesale and retail marketing contracts or the ability of NU Enterprises to elect the normal purchases and sales exception. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 resulted in fair value accounting for certain Utility Group contracts that are subject to unplanned netting and do not meet the definition of capacity contracts. These non-trading derivative contracts are recorded at fai r value at December 31, 2004 and 2003 as derivative assets and liabilities with offsetting amounts
recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets because the contracts are part of providing regulated electric or gas service.
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133, and 'Not Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in EITF Issue No. 02-3," was derived from EITF Issue No. 02-3, which requires net reporting in the income statement of energy trading activities. Issue No. 03-11 addresses income statement classification of revenues related to derivatives that physically deliver and are not related to energy trading activities. Prior to Issue No. 03-11, there was no specific accounting guidance that addressed the classification in the income statement of Select Energy's retail marketing and wholesale contracts or the Utility Group's power supply contracts, many of which are non-trading derivatives.
On July 31, 2003, the EITF reached a consensus in Issue No. 03-11 that determining whether realized gains and losses on contracts that physically deliver and are not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net (sales and purchases both in expenses) or gross (sales in revenues and  purchases in expenses) basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. The EITF indicated that existing accounting guidance should be considered and provided no new guidance in Issue No. 03-11. In Issue No. 03-11, the EITF did not provide transition  guidance, which management could have interpreted as becoming applicable on October 1, 2003 for revenues from that date forward. However, management applied its conclusion on net or gross reporting to all periods presented to enhance comparability.
Select Energy reports the settlement of long-term derivative contracts that physically deliver and are not held for trading purposes on a gross basis, generally with sales in revenues and purchases in expenses. Short-term sales and purchases represent power that is purchased to serve full  requirements contracts but is ultimately not needed based on the actual load of the full requirements customers. This excess power is sold to the independent system operator or to other counterparties. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, settlements of short-term derivative contracts that are not held for trading purposes, are reported on a net basis in expenses.
The Utility Group reports the settlement of all short-term sales contracts that are part of procurement activities on a net basis in expenses.
On June 25, 2003, the DIG cleared Issue No. C-20, which addressed the meaning of "not clearly and closely related regarding contracts with a price adjustment feature" as it relates to the election of the normal purchase and sales exception to derivative accounting. The implementation of this guidance was required for the fourth quarter of 2003 for NU. The implementation of Issue No. C-20 resulted in CL&P recording the fair value of two existing power purchase contracts as derivatives, one as a derivative asset, and one as a derivative liability. An offsetting regulatory liability and an offsetting regulatory asset were recorded, as these contracts are part of stranded costs, and management believes that these costs will continue to be recovered or refunded in rates.
The accounting policies of NU's regulated utility companies historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." The transmission and distribution businesses of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, along with PSNH's generation business and Yankee Gas' distribution business, continue to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and management believes the application of SFAS No. 71 to that portion of those businesses continues to be appropriate. Management must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date. If, as a result of a change in circumstances, it is determined that any portion of these companies no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under SFAS No. 71, that portion of the company will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write-off the respective regulato ry assets and liabilities. Such a write-off could have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Regulatory Accounting:
The application of SFAS No. 71 results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, NU records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. Management must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. Management bases its conclusion on certain factors, including changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and the status of any potential new legislation. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or are probable future refunds to customers.
Management uses its best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements. Management believes it is probable that the Utility Group companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded.
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill balances be reviewed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. NU selected October 1st as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. The goodwill impairment analysis impacts the Yankee Gas and the NU Enterprises segment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired it will be written-off to the extent it is impaired. This could have a significant impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
NU has completed its impairment analyses as of October 1, 2004 for all reporting units that maintain goodwill and has determined that no impairments exist.
In performing the impairment evaluation required by SFAS No. 142, NU estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. NU estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow methodologies and an analysis of comparable companies or transactions. The discounted cash flow analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions, including future growth rates, operating cost escalation rates, allowed ROE, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and long-term earnings multiples of comparable companies. These assumptions are critical to the estimate and are susceptible to change from period to period.
Modifications to the aforementioned assumptions in future periods, particularly changes in discount rates, could result in future impairments of goodwill. Actual financial performance and market conditions in upcoming periods could also impact future impairment analyses.
NU's subsidiaries participate in a uniform noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Pension Plan) covering substantially all regular NU employees. NU also participates in a postretirement benefit plan (PBOP Plan) to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits through a benefit plan to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net periodic benefit credit or cost is based on several significant assumptions. If these assumptions were changed, the resulting change in benefit obligations, fair values of plan assets, funded status and net periodic benefit credits or costs could have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (PBOP):
Pre-tax periodic pension expense/income for the Pension Plan, excluding settlements, curtailments, and special termination benefits, totaled expense of $5.9 million, income of $31.8 million and income of $73.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The pension expense/income amounts exclude one-time items recorded under SFAS No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits."
Results:
As a result of litigation with nineteen former employees, in April 2004, NU was ordered by the court to modify its retirement plan to include special retirement benefits for fifteen of these former employees retroactive to the dates of their retirement and provide increased future monthly benefit payments. In the third quarter of 2004, NU withdrew its appeal of the court's ruling. As a result, NU recorded $2.1 million in special termination benefits related to this litigation in 2004.
There were no settlements, curtailments or special termination benefits recorded in 2003.
Net SFAS No. 88 items associated with early termination programs and the sale of the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear units totaled $22.2 million in income for the year ended December 31, 2002. This amount was recorded as a regulatory liability for refund to customers.
The pre-tax net PBOP Plan cost, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled $41.7 million, $35.1 million and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2002 PBOP Plan cost excludes one-time items associated with the sale of the Seabrook nuclear units. These items totaled $1.2 million in income for the year ended December 31, 2002.
In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, NU evaluated input from actuaries and consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and NU's historical 20-year compounded return of approximately 11 percent. NU's expected long-term rates of return on assets is based on certain target asset allocation assumptions and expected long-term rates of return. NU believes that 8.75 percent is a reasonable long-term rate of return on Pension Plan and PBOP Plan assets for 2004. NU will continue to evaluate the actuarial  assumptions, including the expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust the appropriate assumptions as necessary. The Pension Plan's and PBOP Plan's target asset allocation assumptions and expected long-term rates of return assumptions by asset category are as follows:
Long-Term Rate of Return Assumptions:
The actual asset allocations at December 31, 2004 and 2003 approximated these target asset allocations. NU regularly reviews the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. For information regarding actual asset allocations, see Note 4A, "Employee Benefits  Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," to the consolidated financial statements.
NU bases the actuarial determination of Pension Plan and PBOP Plan income/expense on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation calculation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. Since the market-related valuation calculation recognizes gains or losses over a four-year period, the future value of the market-related assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. There will be no impact on the fair value of Pension Plan and PBOP Plan assets.
Actuarial Determination of Income and Expense:
At December 31, 2004, the Pension Plan had cumulative unrecognized investment gains of $59 million, which will decrease pension expense over the next four years. At December 31, 2004, the Pension Plan had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of $413 million, which will increase pension expense over the expected future working lifetime of active Pension Plan participants, or approximately 13 years. The combined total of unrecognized investment gains and actuarial losses at December 31, 2004 is a net unrecognized loss of $354 million. These gains and losses impact the determination of pension expense and the actuarially determined prepaid pension amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets but have no impact on expected Pension Plan funding.
At December 31, 2004, the PBOP Plan had cumulative unrecognized investment gains of $53 million, which will decrease PBOP Plan expense over the next four years. At December 31, 2004, the PBOP Plan also had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of $219 million, which will increase PBOP Plan expense over the expected future working lifetime of active PBOP Plan participants, or approximately 13 years. The combined total of unrecognized investment gains and actuarial losses at December 31, 2004 is a net unrecognized loss of approximately $166 million. These gains and losses impact the determination of PBOP Plan cost and the actuarially determined accrued PBOP Plan cost recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.
The discount rate that is utilized in determining future pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach where each cash flow related to the Pension or PBOP liability stream is discounted at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of the cash flow. The yield curve is developed from the top quartile of AA rated Moody's and S&P's bonds without callable features outstanding at December 31, 2004. This process calculates the present values of these cash flows and calculates the equivalent single discount rate that produces the same present value for future cash flows. The discount rates determined on this basis are 6.00 percent for the Pension Plan and 5.50 percent for the PBOP Plan at December 31, 2004. Discount rates used at December 31, 2003 were 6.25 percent for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan.
Discount Rate:
Due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on Pension Plan assets of 8.75 percent, a discount rate of 6.00 percent and an expected rate of return on PBOP assets of 6.85 percent for health assets, net of tax and 8.75 percent for life assets and nontaxable health assets, a discount rate of 5.50 percent and various other assumptions, NU estimates that expected contributions to and forecasted expense for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan will be as follows (in millions):
Expected Contribution and Forecasted Expense:
Future actual pension and postretirement expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans and amounts capitalized.
The following represents the increase/(decrease) to the Pension Plan's and PBOP Plan's reported cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points (in millions):
Sensitivity Analysis:
The market-related value of the Pension Plan assets has increased from $1.9 billion at December 31, 2003 to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2004. The projected benefit obligation (PBO) for the Pension Plan has increased from $1.9 billion at December 31, 2003 to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2004. These changes have decreased the funded status of the Pension Plan on a PBO basis from an overfunded position of $3.8 million at December 31, 2003 to an underfunded position of $57.7 million at December 31, 2004. The PBO includes expectations of future employee compensation increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of the Pension Plan was approximately $225 million less than Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2004 and approximately $240 million less than Pension Plan assets at December 31, 2003. The ABO is the obligation for employee service and compensation provided through December 31, 2004. If the A BO exceeds Pension Plan assets at a future plan measurement date, NU will record an additional minimum liability. NU has not made employer contributions since 1991.
Plan Assets:
The value of PBOP Plan assets has increased from $178 million at December 31, 2003 to $199.8 million at December 31, 2004. The benefit obligation for the PBOP Plan has increased from $405 million at December 31, 2003 to $468.3 million at December 31, 2004. These changes have increased the underfunded status of the PBOP Plan on an accumulated projected benefit obligation basis from $227 million at December 31, 2003 to $268.5 million at December 31, 2004. NU has made a contribution each year equal to the PBOP Plan's postretirement benefit cost, excluding curtailment, settlements and special termination benefits.
The health care cost trend assumption used to project increases in medical costs was 8 percent for 2004 and 9 percent for 2003, decreasing one percentage point per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2007. The effect of increasing the health care cost trend by one percentage point would have increased 2004 service and interest cost components of the PBOP Plan cost by $1 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003.
Health Care Cost:
Income tax expense is calculated each year in each of the jurisdictions in which NU operates. This process involves estimating NU's actual current tax exposures as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as timing of the deduction and expenses for tax and book accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in NU's consolidated balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of NU's segments. Adjustments made to income taxes could significantly affect NU's consolidated financial statements. Management must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense , deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances.
Income Taxes:
NU accounts for deferred taxes under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." For temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities that will be recovered in rates in the future, NU has established a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset amounted to $316.3 million and $253.8 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions in which NU's Utility Group companies operate require the tax effect of specific temporary differences to be "flowed through" to utility customers. Flow through treatment means that deferred tax expense is not recorded on the consolidated statements of income. Instead, the tax effect of the temporary difference impacts both amounts for income tax expense currently included in customers' rates and the company's net income. Flow through treatment can result in effective income tax rates that are significantly dif ferent than expected income tax rates. Recording deferred taxes on flow through items is required by SFAS No. 109, and the offset to the deferred tax amounts is the regulatory asset referred to above.
A reconciliation from expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in the accompanying footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1H, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
The estimates that are made by management in order to record income tax expense, accrued taxes and deferred taxes are compared each year to the actual tax amounts filed on NU's income tax returns. The income tax returns were filed in the fall of 2004 for the 2003 tax year, and NU recorded  differences between income tax expense, accrued taxes and deferred taxes on its consolidated financial statements and the amounts that were on its income tax returns.
Depreciation expense is calculated based on an asset's useful life, and judgment is involved when estimating the useful lives of certain assets. A change in the estimated useful lives of these assets could have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements absent timely rate relief for Utility Group assets.
Depreciation:
: Environmental reserves are accrued using a probabilistic model approach when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to environmental liabilities could have a significant effect on earnings. The probabilistic model approach estimates the liability based on the most likely action plan from of a variety of available remediation options, ranging from no action to remedies ranging from establishing institutional controls to full site remediation and long-term monitoring. The probabilistic model approach estimates the liabilities associated with each possible action plan based on findings through various phases of site assessments.
Accounting for Environmental Reserves
These estimates are based on currently available information from presently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and several cost estimates from outside engineering and remediation contractors. These amounts also take into consideration prior experience in remediating contaminated sites and data released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations. These estimates are subjective in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose when working on a specific site. These estimates are subject to revisions in future periods based on actual costs or new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site or newly enacted laws and regulations. The amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs b ased on current site information from site assessments and remediation estimates. These liabilities are estimated on an undiscounted basis.
Under current rate-making policy, PSNH and Yankee Gas have regulatory recovery mechanisms in place for environmental costs. Accordingly, regulatory assets have been recorded for certain of PSNH's and Yankee Gas' environmental liabilities. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $28 million and $26.3 million, respectively, have been recorded as regulatory assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  CL&P recovers a certain level of environmental costs currently in rates but does not have an environmental cost recovery tracking mechanism. Accordingly, changes in CL&P's environmental reserves impact CL&P's earnings. WMECO does not have a regulatory mechanism to recover environmental costs from its customers, and changes in WMECO's environmental reserves impact WMECO's earnings.
Capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to total approximately $104 million in aggregate for the years 2005 through 2009. Of the $104 million, approximately $55 million relates to the conversion of a 50 megawatt oil and coal burning unit at Schiller Station to a wood burning unit to, among other things, provide a reduction in air emissions at the plant and approximately $14 million relates to installing equipment to  meet emission requirements at HWP's Mt. Tom coal-fired generating station. The remainder primarily relates to other environmental remediation programs associated with NU's hydroelectric generation assets.
NU adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 143 requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet at fair value when incurred and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 defines an asset retirement obligation (ARO) as a legal obligation that is required to be settled due to an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or a written or oral promise to remove an asset. AROs may stem from environmental laws, state laws and regulations, easement agreements, building codes, contracts, franchise grants and agreements, oral promises made upon which third parties have relied, or the dismantlement, restoration, or reclamation of properties.
Asset Retirement Obligations:
Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, certain removal obligations were identified that management believes are AROs but either have not been incurred or are not material. These removal obligations arise in the ordinary course of business or have a low probability of occurring. The types of obligations primarily relate to transmission and distribution lines and poles, telecommunication towers, transmission cables and certain FERC or state regulatory agency re-licensing issues. There was no impact to NU's earnings upon adoption of SFAS No. 143; however, if there are changes in certain laws and regulations, orders, interpretations or contracts entered into by NU, there may be future AROs that need to be recorded.
On June 17, 2004, the FASB issued the proposed interpretation, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." The proposed interpretation requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of an ARO that is conditional on a future event if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated and clarifies that there are no circumstances in which a law or regulation obligates an entity to perform retirement activities but then allows the entity to permanently avoid settling the obligation.
If adopted in its current form, there may be an impact to NU for AROs that NU currently concludes have not been incurred (conditional obligations). These conditional obligations may include utility poles and asbestos that, if removed or disturbed by construction or demolition, creates a disposal obligation. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of the interpretation on NU.
Under SFAS No. 71, regulated utilities, including NU's Utility Group companies, currently recover amounts in rates for future costs of removal of plant assets. Future removals of assets do not represent legal obligations and are not AROs. Historically, these amounts were included as a component of accumulated depreciation until spent. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, these amounts totaling $328.8 million and $334 million, respectively, are classified as regulatory liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
: In addition to SPEs that are described in the "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis, during 2001 and 2002, to facilitate the issuance of rate reduction bonds and certificates intended to finance certain stranded costs, NU established four SPEs: CL&P Funding LLC, PSNH Funding LLC, PSNH Funding LLC 2, and WMECO Funding LLC (the funding companies). The funding companies were created as part of state-sponsored securitization programs. The funding companies are restricted from engaging in non- related activities and are required to operate in a manner intended to reduce the likelihood that they would be included in their respective parent company's bankruptcy estate if they ever become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. The funding companies and the securitization amounts are consolidated in the accompanying consolidated fina ncial statements.
Special Purpose Entities
During 1999, SESI established an SPE, HEC/Tobyhanna, in connection with a federal energy savings performance project located at the United States Army Depot in Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania. HEC/Tobyhanna sold $26.5 million of Certificates related to the project and used the funds to repay SESI for the costs of the project. HEC/Tobyhanna's activities and Certificates are included in NU's consolidated financial statements.
:  The accounting for the business segments of NU Enterprises at December 31, 2004 assumed that those businesses are going concerns and will continue to be NU Enterprises' segments in the future. The comprehensive review of each of the NU Enterprises businesses resulted in decisions that changed the existing going concern accounting conclusions for certain of those businesses on March 9, 2005. The impacts of the decisions could be material and could include:
Accounting Implications of NU Enterprises Comprehensive Business Review
The impairment of long-lived assets if they are no longer held and used and become held for sale at expected sales prices that are less than carrying values.
The impairment of goodwill if expected cash flows that support the fair values of the reporting units that hold goodwill are reduced significantly by a change in business strategy or a decision to sell all or portions of the reporting units at prices less than carrying values.
The impairment of intangible assets if expected cash flows that support them are reduced to below their carrying values.
The recognition of closure costs such as severance, benefit plan curtailments, and lease termination payments.
The recognition of losses associated with settling energy contracts currently accounted for on an accrual method of accounting that have negative fair values at the time of settlement.
The termination of the normal purchase and sales exception to fair value accounting for derivatives and the resulting recognition of losses or gains on changes in fair value of the contracts since inception.
The methods of implementing the company's decision involving the wholesale marketing and services businesses are under review. Accordingly, management cannot determine the amounts of impairments or other losses.
For further information regarding the matters in this "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section, see Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," Note 4, "Employee Benefits," Note 5, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and Note 6B, "Commitments and Contingencies  Environmental Matters," to the consolidated financial statements.
Other Matters
For further information regarding other commitments and contingencies, see Note 6, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: Information regarding  NU's contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2004 is summarized through 2009 and thereafter as follows:
Commitments and Contingencies:
(a)
Included in NU's debt agreements are usual and customary positive, negative and financial covenants. Non-compliance with certain covenants, for example the timely payment of principal and interest, may constitute an event of default, which could cause an acceleration of principal in the absence of receipt by the company of a waiver or amendment. Such acceleration would change the obligations outlined in the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments.
(b)
The capital lease obligations include imputed interest of $16.2 million.
(c)
NU has no provisions in its capital or operating lease agreements or agreements related to its long-term contractual arrangements or Select Energy purchase commitments that could trigger a change in terms and conditions, such as acceleration of payment obligations.
(d)
Amounts are not included on NU's consolidated balance sheets.
(e)
Select Energy's purchase agreement amounts can exceed the amount expected to be reported in fuel, purchased and net interchange power because energy trading purchases are classified in revenues.
Rate reduction bond amounts are non-recourse to NU, have no required payments over the next five years and are not included in this table. The Utility Group's standard offer service contracts and default service contracts also are not included in this table. The estimated payments under interest rate swap agreements are not included in this table as the estimated payment amounts are not determinable. For further information regarding NU's contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and related footnotes, and Note 2, "Short-Term Debt," Note 6D, "Commitments and Contingencies  Long-Term Contractual Arrangements," and Note 9, "Leases," to the consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations
The components of significant income statement variances for the past two years are provided in the table below.  
(a) Percent greater than 100.
Operating Revenues
Total revenues increased $605 million in 2004, compared with 2003, due to higher revenues from NU Enterprises ($375 million), higher electric distribution revenues ($172 million), higher gas distribution revenues ($46 million) and higher regulated transmission revenues ($13 million).
The NU Enterprises' revenue increase of $375 million is primarily due to higher revenues for the merchant retail energy business ($197 million), the 2003 revenue reduction recorded for the settlement of a wholesale power dispute associated with CL&P standard offer supply ($56 million), and an increased level of competitive energy services business ($30 million). Higher revenues for the merchant retail energy business resulted from higher electric volumes ($119 million), higher gas prices ($48 million), higher electric prices ($28 million), and higher gas volumes ($2 million). The competitive energy services business revenue increase resulted from higher revenues from a cogeneration project and higher volumes in the mechanical contracting group.
The electric distribution revenue increase of $172 million is primarily due to non-earnings components of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail rates ($141 million). The distribution component of these companies and the retail transmission component of CL&P and PSNH that flow through to earnings increased $33 million, primarily due to the CL&P retail transmission rate increase effective in January 2004. The nonearnings components increase of $141 million is primarily due to the pass through of energy supply costs ($269 million) and CL&P FMCC ($151 million), partially offset by the resolution of SMD cost recovery which was being collected from CL&P customers in 2003 and early 2004 and subsequently refunded beginning in late 2004 ($71 million), lower CL&P EAC revenue as a result of the end of EAC billings in 2003 ($44 million), lower transition cost recoveries for CL&P and WMECO ($44 million) and lower CL& P system benefit cost recoveries ($31 million). Regulated retail sales increased 0.9 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. On a weather adjusted basis, retail sales increased 1.9 percent as a result of improved economic conditions and increasing use per customer. In addition, electric wholesale revenues decreased $72 million, primarily due to lower Utility Group sales related to IPP contracts and the expiration of long-term contracts.
The higher gas distribution revenue of $46 million is primarily due to the increased recovery of gas costs ($17 million) and the absence of the 2003 unbilled revenue adjustment ($28 million).
Transmission revenues were higher primarily due to the October 2003 implementation of the transmission rate case approved at the FERC.
Total revenues increased $782 million in 2003, compared with 2002, due to higher revenues from NU Enterprises ($538 million), higher Utility Group electric revenues ($165 million) and higher Utility Group gas revenues ($79 million).
The NU Enterprises' revenue increase of $538 million is primarily due to higher wholesale and retail requirements sales volumes ($386 million) and higher prices ($339 million).
The Utility Group revenue increase of $165 million is primarily due to higher retail electric revenue ($217 million), partially offset by lower wholesale revenue ($57 million). The regulated retail electric revenue increase is primarily due to higher CL&P recovery of incremental locational marginal pricing (LMP) costs net of amounts to be returned to customers ($72 million), higher sales volumes ($73 million), an adjustment to unbilled revenues ($46 million) and a higher average price resulting from the mix among customer classes for the regulated companies ($25 million). The higher Yankee Gas revenue is primarily due to higher recovery of gas costs ($81 million) and higher gas sales volumes ($26 million), partially offset by an adjustment to unbilled revenues ($28 million). Regulated retail electric kWh sales increased by 2.1 percent and firm natural gas sales increased by 7.8 percent in 2003, before the adjustments to u nbilled revenues. The regulated wholesale revenue decrease is primarily due to lower PSNH 2003 sales as a result of the sale of Seabrook.
Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power
Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expense increased $496 million in 2004, primarily due to higher wholesale costs at NU Enterprises ($224 million) and higher purchased power costs for the Utility Group ($272 million). The increase for the Utility Group is primarily due to an increase in the standard offer supply costs for CL&P ($152 million) and WMECO ($16 million), higher Yankee Gas expenses ($33 million) primarily due to increased gas prices, higher expenses for PSNH ($10 million) primarily due to higher energy and capacity purchases, partially offset by the 2003 CL&P recovery of certain fuel costs ($44 million).
Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expense increased $686 million in 2003, primarily due to higher wholesale energy purchases at NU Enterprises ($630 million) and higher gas costs ($77 million), partially offset by lower nuclear fuel ($20 million).
Other Operation
Other operation expenses increased $105 million in 2004, primarily due to higher expenses for NU Enterprises resulting from the increased volume in the contracting business ($45 million), higher CL&P RMR costs and other power pool related expenses ($71 million), higher PSNH fossil production expense ($6 million), and higher distribution expenses ($4 million), partially offset by lower C&LM expense ($20 million).
Other operation expense increased $92 million in 2003, primarily due to higher expenses for NU Enterprises resulting from service business growth ($13 million), higher regulated business administrative and general expenses primarily due to higher health care costs ($16 million), lower pension income ($31 million), higher RMR related transmission expense ($30 million), higher conservation and load management expenditures ($16 million), higher distribution expense ($6 million), and higher load and dispatch expenses ($6 million), partially offset by lower nuclear expense due to the sale of Seabrook ($29 million).
Maintenance
Maintenance expense increased $13 million in 2004, primarily due to higher expenses for NU Enterprises at its generating plants ($5 million), the absence of the 2003 positive resolution of the Millstone use of proceeds docket ($5 million) and higher electric distribution expenses ($5 million).
Maintenance expense decreased $24 million in 2003, primarily due to lower nuclear expense resulting from the sale of Seabrook ($26 million), partially offset by higher gas distribution expenses ($2 million).
Depreciation
Depreciation increased $20 million in 2004 due to higher Utility Group plant balances and higher depreciation rates at CL&P resulting from the distribution rate case decision effective in January 2004.
Depreciation decreased $1 million in 2003 primarily due to lower decommissioning and depreciation expenses resulting from 2002 depreciation of Seabrook as compared to no 2003 Seabrook-related depreciation ($7 million) and lower NU Enterprises depreciation due to a study which resulted in lengthening the useful lives of certain generation assets ($3 million), partially offset by higher Utility Group depreciation resulting from higher plant balances ($9 million).
Amortization
Amortization decreased $53 million in 2004 primarily due to lower Utility Group recovery of stranded costs and a decrease in amortization expense resulting from the amortization of GSC over-recoveries allowed in the CL&P distribution rate case effective in January 2004 ($29 million).
Amortization decreased $129 million in 2003 primarily due to the 2002 amortization of stranded costs upon the sale of Seabrook ($183 million), partially offset by higher amortization in 2003 related to the Utility Group's recovery of stranded costs ($62 million), in part resulting from higher wholesale revenue from the sale of IPP related energy.
Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds
Amortization of rate reduction bonds increased $12 million in 2004 due to the repayment of a higher principal amount as compared to 2003. Amortization of rate reduction bonds increased $5 million in 2003 due to the repayment of principal.
Taxes Other Than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes increased $11 million in 2004 primarily due to higher payroll taxes ($4 million), higher sales tax ($3 million) and higher local property taxes ($2 million).
Taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million in 2003, primarily due to a credit recorded in 2002 recognizing a Connecticut sales and use tax audit settlement ($8 million), partially offset by a lower 2003 payment to compensate the Town of Waterford for lost property tax revenue as a result of the sale of Millstone ($3 million) and lower New Hampshire property taxes due to the sale of Seabrook ($2 million).
Gain on Sale of Utility Plant
Gain on the sale of utility plant decreased $187 million in 2003 due to the gain recognized in 2002 resulting from CL&P's and North Atlantic Energy Corporation's (NAEC) sale of Seabrook ($187 million).
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased $7 million in 2004 primarily due to the issuance of $75 million of ten-year notes at Yankee Gas in January 2004, the issuance of $50 million of thirty-year senior notes at WMECO in September 2004, and the issuance of $150 million of five-year notes at NU Parent in June 2003.
Interest expense, net decreased $27 million in 2003 primarily due to lower interest for the regulated subsidiaries resulting from lower rates ($12 million), lower interest at NU Parent as a result of the interest rate swap related to its $263 million fixed-rate senior notes ($8 million), capitalized interest on prepayments for generator interconnections ($4 million) and lower NAEC interest due to the retirement of debt ($3 million), partially offset by higher competitive business interest as a result of higher debt levels ($3 million).
Other Income/(Loss), Net
Other income/(loss), net increased $15 million in 2004 primarily due to the recognition, beginning in 2004, of a CL&P procurement fee approved in the TSO docket decision ($12 million).
Other (loss)/income, net decreased $46 million in 2003 primarily due to the 2002 elimination of certain reserves associated with NU's ownership share of Seabrook ($25 million), 2002 Seabrook related gains ($15 million), lower equity in earnings from the Yankee companies in 2003 ($7 million), a higher level of donations in 2003 ($5 million), RMS losses recorded in 2003 ($4 million) and lower 2003 conservation and load management incentive income ($2 million), partially offset by 2002 investment write-downs ($18 million).
Income Taxes
Included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a reconciliation of actual and expected tax expense. The tax effect of temporary differences is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions. In past years, this rate-making treatment has required the company to provide the customers with a portion of the tax benefits associated with accelerated tax depreciation in the year it is generated (flow-through depreciation). As these flow-through differences turn around, higher tax expense is recorded.
Income tax expense increased by $7 million in 2004 due to higher reversal of prior flow-through depreciation and lower favorable adjustments to tax expense, partially offset by lower state income tax expense, due to increased state tax credits and favorable unitary apportionment.
Income tax expense decreased by $25 million in 2003, primarily due to lower taxable income.
Net (Loss)/Income from Discontinued Operations
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the (loss)/income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income.  See Note 17, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Net of Tax Benefit
A cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax benefit ($5 million) was recorded in the third quarter of 2003 in connection with the adoption of FIN 46, which required NU to consolidate RMS into NU's financial statements and adjust its equity interest as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.

Northeast Utilities Service Company (NUSCO) provides centralized accounting, administrative, engineering, financial, information technology, legal, operational, planning, purchasing, and other services to NU's companies. Three other subsidiaries construct, acquire or lease some of the property and facilities used by NU's companies.
The Utility Group furnishes franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts through three companies: The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO). Another company, North Atlantic Energy Corporation (NAEC), previously sold all of its entitlement to the capacity and output of the Seabrook nuclear unit (Seabrook) to PSNH under the terms of two, life-of-unit, full cost recovery contracts (Seabrook Power Contracts). Seabrook was sold on November 1, 2002. Another Utility Group subsidiary is Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), which is Connecticut's largest natural gas distribution system. The Utility Group includes three reportable business segments: the regulated electric utility distribution segment, the regulated gas utility distribution segment and the regul ated electric utility transmission segment.
Utility Group:
Effective January 1, 2004, PSNH completed the purchase of the electric system and retail franchise of Connecticut Valley Electric Company (CVEC), a subsidiary of Central Vermont Public Service Corporation (CVPS), for $30.1 million. CVEC's 11,000 customers in western New Hampshire have been added to PSNH's customer base of more than 460,000 customers. The purchase price included the book value of CVEC's plant assets of approximately $9 million and an additional $21 million to terminate an above-market wholesale power purchase agreement CVEC had with CVPS. The $21 million payment is being recovered from PSNH's customers.
NU Enterprises, Inc. is the parent company of Northeast Generation Company (NGC), Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS), Select Energy, Inc. (Select Energy),  Select Energy Services, Inc. (SESI) and their respective subsidiaries, Select Energy Contracting, Inc. (SECI), Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc. (Reeds Ferry) and Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network), all of which are collectively referred to as "NU Enterprises." The generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) are also included in the results of NU Enterprises. The companies included in the NU Enterprises segment are grouped into two business segments: the merchant energy segment and the energy services business segment. The merchant energy business segment is comprised of Select Energy's wholesale marketing business, which includes approximately 1,296 megawatts (MW) of pumped storage and hydroelectric g eneration assets owned by NGC, 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets owned by HWP, and Select Energy's retail marketing business.
NU Enterprises:
The energy services and other business segment includes the operations of SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, NGS, and Woods Network. SESI performs energy management services for large commercial customers, institutional facilities and the United States government and energy-related construction services. SECI provides mechanical and electrical contracting services for new construction and service contracts.  Reeds Ferry purchases equipment on behalf of SECI.  NGS operates and maintains NGC's and HWP's generation assets and provides third-party electrical services.  Woods Network is a network design, products and services company.

Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of NU and of its subsidiaries, as applicable, include the accounts of all their respective subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Subsequent to the filing of its 2003 Form 10-K and annual report, NU concluded that it incorrectly classified as unrestricted cash from counterparties amounts that should have been classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003. These corrections reclassified unrestricted cash from counterparties to cash and cash equivalents because those funds were unrestricted and were used to fund or were available to fund the company's operations. The December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet has been restated for these corrections and a correction to decrease derivative assets and liabilities by the same amount in order to eliminate intercompany derivative assets and liabilities. See Note 16, "Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements," to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Additionally, certain reclassifications of prior year's data have been made to conform with the current year's presentation. See Note 16 for the effects of the significant reclassifications which include the reclassification of $5.6 million in cash dividends on preferred stock of subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented.
NU's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to present the operations for the following companies as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation:
SESI and its wholly owned subsidiaries HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC;
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry) (SECI-NH), a division of SECI;
Woods Network; and
Woods Electrical Co., Inc. (Woods Electrical).  
For further information regarding these companies, see Note 17, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements.  NU's consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of shareholders' equity, and consolidated statements of capitalization were not impacted by this revision.

New Accounting Standards
The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued and later deferred the effective date of accounting guidance in EITF Issue No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." EITF Issue No. 03-1 provides guidance on how to evaluate and recognize an impairment loss that is other-than-temporary and could impact NU's investments in Acumentrics Corporation (Acumentrics) and NEON Communications, Inc. (NEON) upon its effective date. Certain accounting guidance included in EITF Issue No. 03-1 is not effective until the FASB concludes on this issue. EITF Issue No. 03-1 also requires certain annual disclosures, which are included in this annual report.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments:
For information regarding these disclosures see Note 1J, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Other Investments" and Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payments," (SFAS No. 123R), which amended SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123R requires all companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted to employees. NU has elected to apply SFAS No. 123R on a modified prospective method. Under this method, NU will recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on July 1, 2005, the effective date of SFAS No. 123R, and any new awards after that date. NU is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 123R, but management believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Payments:
For further information regarding equity-based compensation, see Note 1N, "Equity-Based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements.
): On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed into law a bill that expands Medicare, primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit and by adding a federal subsidy to qualifying plan sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. NU chose to reflect the impact on December 31, 2003 reported amounts with no impact on 2003 expenses, assets, or liabilities.
Accounting for the Effect of Medicare Changes on Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension (PBOP
On May 19, 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," to provide guidance on accounting for the effects of the aforementioned Medicare expansion. This FSP concludes that the effects of the federal subsidy should be considered an actuarial gain and treated like similar gains and losses and requires certain disclosures for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits which are included in this annual report. The accounting treatment under FSP No. FAS 106-2 is consistent with NU's accounting treatment at December 31, 2003 and reduced the projected benefit obligation by $7.5 million and $19.5 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (FIN 46R). FIN 46R resulted in fewer NU investments meeting the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE). FIN 46R was effective for NU for the first quarter of 2004 and did not have an impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities:
D.
Guarantees
NU provides credit assurance in the form of guarantees and letters of credit in the normal course of business, primarily for the financial performance obligations of NU Enterprises. NU would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of non-performance by NU Enterprises, primarily Select Energy. At December 31, 2004, the maximum level of exposure in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," under guarantees by NU, primarily on behalf of NU Enterprises, totaled $1.1 billion. A majority of these guarantees do not have established expiration dates. For the guarantees with expiration dates, most are due to expire by December 31, 2005. Additionally, NU had $48.9 million of letters of credit issued, of which $33.9 million were issued for the benefit of NU Enterprises at December 31, 2004.
At December 31, 2004, NU had outstanding guarantees on behalf of the Utility Group of $12.7 million. This amount is included in the total outstanding NU guarantee exposure amount of $1.1 billion.
Several underlying contracts that NU guarantees and certain surety bonds contain credit ratings triggers that would require NU to post collateral in the event that NU's credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade.
NU currently has authorization from the SEC to provide up to $750 million of guarantees for NU Enterprises through June 30, 2007. The $12.7  million in guarantees to the Utility Group are subject to a separate $50 million SEC limitation apart from the current $750 million guarantee limit. The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit for NU Enterprises at December 31, 2004 is $358.6 million, which is  calculated using different, more probabilistic and fair-value based criteria than the maximum level of exposure required to be disclosed under FIN 45. FIN 45 includes all exposures even though they are not reasonably likely to result in exposure to NU.
On October 19, 2004, the SEC authorized NU to issue guarantees of up to an aggregate $100 million through June 30, 2007 of the debt or other obligations of two of its subsidiaries, NUSCO and Rocky River Realty Company. These companies provide certain specialized support and real estate services and occasionally enter into transactions that require financial backing from NU parent. The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit under this category at December 31, 2004 is $0.2 million.
E.
Revenues
Utility Group retail revenues are based on rates approved by the state regulatory commissions. These regulated rates are applied to customers' use of energy to calculate a bill. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions.
Utility Group:
Certain Utility Group companies utilize regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms to track the recovery of certain incurred costs. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically, with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections collected from customers in future periods.
Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or gas delivered to customers that has not been billed. Unbilled revenues are assets on the balance sheet that become accounts receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when changes in estimating methodology occur and under other circumstances.
Utility Group Unbilled Revenues:
The Utility Group estimates unbilled revenues monthly using the requirements method. The requirements method utilizes the total monthly volume of electricity or gas delivered to the system and applies a delivery efficiency (DE) factor to reduce the total monthly volume by an estimate of delivery losses in order to calculate total estimated monthly sales to customers. The total estimated monthly sales amount less the total monthly billed sales amount results in a monthly estimate of unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating sales to the respective rate classes, then applying an average rate to the estimate of unbilled sales. The estimated DE factor can have a significant impact on estimated unbilled revenue amounts.
In accordance with management's policy of testing the estimate of unbilled revenues twice each year using the cycle method of estimating unbilled revenues, testing was performed in the second and fourth quarters of 2004 but did not have a material impact on earnings. The cycle method uses the billed sales from each meter reading cycle and an estimate of unbilled days in each month based on the meter reading schedule. The cycle method is more accurate than the requirements method when used in a mostly weather-neutral month.
During 2003 the cycle method resulted in adjustments to the estimate of unbilled revenues that had a net positive after-tax earnings impact of approximately $4.6 million. The 2003 positive after-tax impacts on CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO were $7.2 million, $3.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. There was a negative after-tax impact on Yankee Gas of $6.2 million, including certain gas cost adjustments.
Wholesale transmission revenues are based on rates and formulas that are approved by the FERC. Most of NU's wholesale transmission revenues are collected through a combination of the New England Regional Network Service (RNS) tariff and NU's Local Network Service (LNS) tariff. The RNS tariff, which is administered by the New England Independent System Operator, recovers the revenue requirements associated with transmission facilities that are deemed by the FERC to be regional facilities. This regional rate is reset on June 1st of each year. The LNS tariff provides for the recovery of NU's total transmission revenue requirements, net of revenues received from other sources, including those revenues received under RNS rates. NU's LNS tariff is also reset on June 1st of each year to coincide with the change in RNS rates. Additionally, NU's LNS tariff provides f or a true-up to actual costs which ensures that NU recovers its total transmission revenue requirements, including an allowed ROE.
Utility Group Transmission Revenues:
A significant portion of NU's transmission businesses' revenue is from charges to NU's distribution businesses. These distribution businesses recover these charges through rates charged to their retail customers. WMECO has a rate tracking mechanism to track transmission costs charged in distribution rates to the actual amount of transmission charges incurred. The 2004 rates set in the CL&P distribution rate case contained a level of transmission revenue sufficient to recover CL&P's anticipated 2004 transmission costs. The June 1, 2005 PSNH retail rate increase includes revenues to recover expected transmission costs. Neither CL&P nor PSNH have transmission cost tracking mechanisms.
NU Enterprises: NU Enterprises' revenues are recognized at different times for its different business lines. Wholesale and retail marketing revenues are recognized when energy is delivered. Trading revenues are recognized as the fair value of trading contracts changes. Service revenues are recognized as services are provided, often on a percentage of completion basis.
F.
Derivative Accounting
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amended SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 incorporated interpretations that were included in previous Derivative Implementation Group guidance, clarified certain conditions, and amended other existing pronouncements. It was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Management has determined that the adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not change NU's accounting for wholesale and retail marketing contracts, or the ability of NU Enterprises to elect the normal purchases and sales exception. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 resulted in fair value accounting for certain of Utility Group contracts that are subject to unplanned netting and do not meet the definition of capacity contracts. These non-trading derivative contracts are recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities with offsetting amounts recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets because the contracts are part of providing regulated electric or gas service and because management believes that these amounts will be recovered or refunded in rates.
SFAS Nos. 133 and 149:
In August of 2003, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by its EITF in July 2003 on EITF Issue No. 03-11, "Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes' as Defined in Issue No. 02-3." Prior to Issue No. 03-11, no specific guidance existed to address the classification in the income statement of derivative contracts that are not held for trading purposes. The consensus stated that determining whether realized gains and losses on contracts that physically deliver and are not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross basis was a matter of judgment that depended on the relevant facts and circumstances. NU Enterprises and the Utility Group have derivative sales contracts, and though these contracts may result in physical delivery, management has determined, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, that because these transactions are part of the respective companies' procurement activities, inclusion in operating expenses better depicts these sales activities. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the settlement of these derivative contracts that are not held for trading purposes are reported on a net basis in expenses.
EITF Issue No. 03-11:
In EITF Issue No. 03-11, the EITF did not provide transition guidance, which management could have interpreted as becoming applicable on October 1, 2003 for revenues from that date forward. However, management applied its conclusion on net or gross reporting to all periods presented to enhance comparability. Operating revenues and fuel, purchased and net interchange power for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflect net reporting. The adoption of net reporting had no effect on net income.
Contracts: The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies between contracts and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contracts are derivatives.  Non-derivative contracts are recorded at the time of delivery or settlement.
Accounting for Energy
Most of the contracts comprising Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing activities are derivatives. The application of derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, is complex and requires management's judgment. Judgment is applied in the election and designation of the normal purchases and sale exception (and resulting accounting upon delivery or settlement), which includes the conclusions that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then the normal exception and accounting upon delivery or settlement would be terminated and fair value accounting would be applied.
Both long-term non-derivative contracts and long-term derivative contracts that are normal are recorded in revenues when these contracts represent  sales, and recorded in fuel, purchased and net interchange power when these contracts represent purchases, except for sales contracts that relate to procurement activities. These contracts are recorded in fuel, purchased and net interchange power when settled.
Derivative contracts that are entered into for trading purposes are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and changes in fair value impact earnings. Revenues and expenses for these contracts are recorded on a net basis in revenues. Derivative contracts that are not held for trading purposes and that do not qualify as normal purchases and sales or hedges are non-trading derivative contracts. These contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and changes in fair value for these contracts are recorded primarily in expenses.
Contracts that are hedging an underlying transaction and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value generally reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Hedges impact earnings when the forecasted transaction being hedged occurs, when hedge ineffectiveness is measured  and recorded, when the forecasted transaction being hedged is no longer probable of occurring, or when there is an accumulated other comprehensive loss and when the hedge and the forecasted transaction being hedged are in a loss position on a combined basis.
For further information regarding these contracts and their accounting, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the consolidated financial statements.
G.
Utility Group Regulatory Accounting
The accounting policies of NU's Utility Group conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
The transmission and distribution businesses of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, along with PSNH's generation business and Yankee Gas' distribution business, continue to be cost-of-service rate regulated. New Hampshire's electric utility industry restructuring laws have been modified to delay the sale of PSNH's fossil and hydroelectric generation assets until at least April of 2006. There has been no regulatory action to the contrary, and management currently has no plans to divest of these generation assets. As the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) has allowed and is expected to continue to allow rate recovery of a return on and recovery of these assets, as well as all operating expenses, PSNH meets the criteria for the application of SFAS No. 71. Stranded costs related to generation assets, to the extent not currently recovered in rates, are deferred as Part 3 stranded costs under the "Agre ement to Settle PSNH Restructuring" (Restructuring Settlement). Part 3 stranded costs are non-securitized regulatory assets that must be recovered by a recovery end date determined in accordance with the Restructuring Settlement or be written off.
Management believes the application of SFAS No. 71 to the portions of those businesses continues to be appropriate. Management also believes it is probable that NU's Utility Group companies will recover their investments in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets. In addition, all material net regulatory assets are earning an equity return, except for securitized regulatory assets, which are not supported by equity.
The components of regulatory assets are as follows:
Regulatory Assets:
Additionally, the Utility Group had $11.6 million and $12.3 million of regulatory costs at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, that are included in deferred debits and other assets  other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These amounts represent regulatory costs that have not yet been approved by the applicable regulatory agency. Management believes that these costs are recoverable in future rates.
In March of 2001, CL&P and WMECO sold their ownership interests in the Millstone nuclear units (Millstone). The gains on the sale in the amounts of approximately $521.6 million and $119.8 million, respectively, for CL&P and WMECO were used to offset recoverable nuclear costs. These unamortized recoverable nuclear costs amounted to $22.5 million at December 31, 2003, and were fully recovered by December 31, 2004. Additionally, PSNH recorded a regulatory asset in conjunction with the sale of Millstone 3 with an unamortized balance of $29.7 million and $33.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which is included in recoverable nuclear costs. Also included in recoverable nuclear costs for 2004 and 2003 are $22.3 million and $26.6 million, respectively, primarily related to Millstone 1 recoverable nuclear costs associated with the undepreciated plant and related assets at t he time Millstone 1 was shutdown.
Recoverable Nuclear Costs:
In March 2001, CL&P issued $1.4 billion in rate reduction certificates. CL&P used $1.1 billion of the proceeds from that issuance to buyout or buydown certain contracts with independent power producers (IPP). The unamortized CL&P securitized asset balance is $850 million and $960.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. CL&P used the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the rate reduction certificates to securitize a portion of its SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," regulatory asset. The securitized SFAS No. 109 regulatory asset had a balance remaining of $144.3 million and $163.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Securitized Assets:
In April 2001, PSNH issued rate reduction bonds in the amount of $525 million. PSNH used the majority of the proceeds from that issuance to buydown its power contracts with NAEC. The remaining PSNH securitized asset balance is $392.2 million and $427.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In January 2002, PSNH issued an additional $50 million in rate reduction bonds and used the proceeds from that issuance to repay short-term debt that was incurred to buyout a purchased-power contract in December 2001. The remaining PSNH securitized asset balance for the January 2002 issuance is $29.4 million and $37.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In May 2001, WMECO issued $155 million in rate reduction certificates and used the majority of the proceeds from that issuance to buyout an IPP contract. The remaining WMECO securitized asset balance is $121.5 million and $132 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Securitized assets are being recovered over the amortization period of their associated rate reduction certificates and bonds. All outstanding rate reduction certificates of CL&P are scheduled to amortize by December 30, 2010, while PSNH rate reduction bonds are scheduled to fully amortize by May 1, 2013, and WMECO rate reduction certificates are scheduled to fully amortize by June 1, 2013.
The tax effect of temporary differences (differences between the periods in which transactions affect income in the financial statements and the periods in which they affect the determination of taxable income) is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and SFAS No. 109. Differences in income taxes between SFAS No. 109 and the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions are recorded as regulatory assets. For further information regarding income taxes, see Note 1H, "Summary of  Significant Accounting Policies  Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes, Net:
CL&P, WMECO and PSNH, under the terms of contracts with the Yankee Companies, are responsible for their proportionate share of the remaining costs of the units, including decommissioning. These amounts are recorded as unrecovered contractual obligations. A portion of these obligations for CL&P was securitized in 2001 and is included in securitized regulatory assets. Amounts for PSNH are being recovered along with other stranded costs. See Note 6E, "Deferred Contractual Obligations" for additional information.
Unrecovered Contractual Obligations:
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act), CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and NAEC were assessed for their proportionate shares of the costs of decontaminating and decommissioning uranium enrichment plants owned by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) (D&D Assessment). The Energy Act requires that regulators treat D&D Assessments as a reasonable and necessary current cost of fuel, to be fully recovered in rates like any other fuel cost. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO no longer own nuclear generation but continue to recover these costs through rates. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, NU's total D&D Assessment deferrals were $13.9 million and $18 million, respectively, and have been recorded as recoverable energy costs. Also included in recoverable energy costs at December 31, 2004, is $32.5 million related to federally mandated congestion charges. During 2003, CL&P paid for a temporary generation resource in southwest Connecticut to help maintain reliability. Costs for this resource of $15.8 million were recorded as recoverable energy costs at December 31, 2003.
Recoverable Energy Costs:
In conjunction with the implementation of restructuring under the Restructuring Settlement on May 1, 2001, PSNH's fuel and purchased power adjustment clause (FPPAC) was discontinued. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, PSNH had $144.8 million and $162.2 million, respectively, of recoverable energy costs deferred under the FPPAC. Under the Restructuring Settlement, the FPPAC deferrals are recovered as a Part 3 stranded cost through a stranded cost recovery charge. Also included in PSNH's recoverable energy costs are deferred costs associated with certain contractual purchases from IPPs. These costs are also treated as Part 3 stranded costs and amounted to $50.1 million and $56.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The regulated rates of Yankee Gas include a purchased gas adjustment clause under which gas costs above or below base rate levels are charged to or credited to customers. Differences between the actual purchased gas costs and the current rate recovery are deferred and recovered or refunded in future periods. These amounts are recorded as recoverable energy costs of $13.7 million and $2.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The majority of the recoverable energy costs are currently recovered in rates from the customers of CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas. PSNH's recoverable energy costs are Part 3 stranded costs which are non-securitized regulatory assets which must be recovered by a recovery end date determined in accordance with the Restructuring Settlement or be written off. Based on current projections, PSNH expects to fully recover all of its Part 3 costs by the recovery end date.
The Utility Group had $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Regulatory Liabilities:
These amounts are comprised of the following:
Under SFAS No. 71, regulated utilities, including NU's Utility Group companies, currently recover amounts in rates for future costs of removal of plant assets. Historically, these amounts were included as a component of accumulated depreciation until spent. These amounts are classified as regulatory liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."
The Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and IPP over market costs while the Generation Service Charge (GSC) allows CL&P to recover the costs of the procurement of energy for standard offer service. The System Benefits Charge (SBC) allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced workers protection costs. The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs.
The regulatory liabilities offsetting derivative assets relate primarily to the fair value of CL&P IPP contracts and PSNH purchase and sales contracts used for market discovery of future procurement activities that will benefit ratepayers in the future.
H.
Income Taxes
The tax effect of temporary differences (differences between the periods in which transactions affect income in the financial statements and the periods in which they affect the determination of taxable income) is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and SFAS No. 109.
NU and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Likewise NU and its subsidiaries file state income tax returns, with some filing in more than one state. NU and its subsidiaries are parties to a tax allocation agreement under which taxable subsidiaries pay no more taxes than they would have otherwise paid had they filed a standalone tax return. Subsidiaries generating tax losses are similarly paid for their losses when utilized.
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the current and long-term net accumulated deferred tax obligations are as follows:
At December 31, 2004, NU had state net operating loss carry forwards of $206.2 million that expire between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2004, NU also had state credit carry forwards of $9.3 million that expire on December 31, 2009.
At December 31, 2003, NU had state net operating loss carry forwards of $119.5 million that expire between December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2023. The state net operating losses produced a deferred tax asset of $17.2 million and $10.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
NU had established a valuation allowance of $12.6 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In 2000, NU requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) regarding the treatment of unamortized investment tax credits (ITC) and excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) related to generation assets that have been sold. EDIT are temporary differences between book and taxable income that were recorded when the federal statutory tax rate was higher than it is now or when those differences were expected to be resolved. The PLR addresses whether or not EDIT and ITC can be returned to customers, which without a PLR management believes would represent a violation of current tax law. The IRS declared a moratorium on issuing PLRs until final regulations on the return of EDIT and ITC to regulated customers are issued by the Treasury Department. Proposed regulations were issued in March 2003, and a hearing took place in June 2003. The proposed new regulations would allow the return of EDIT and ITC to regul ated customers without violating the tax law. Also, under the proposed regulations, a company could elect to apply the regulation retroactively. The Treasury Department is currently deliberating the comments received at the hearing. The ultimate results of this contingency could have a positive impact on CL&P's earnings.
I.
Accounting for R.M. Services, Inc.
NU had an investment in R.M. Services, Inc. (RMS), a provider of consumer collection services. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which was effective for NU on July 1, 2003. RMS is a VIE, as defined. FIN 46, as revised, requires that the party to a VIE that absorbs the majority of the VIE's losses, defined as the "primary beneficiary," consolidate the VIE. Upon adoption of FIN 46 on July 1, 2003, management determined that NU was the "primary beneficiary" of RMS under FIN 46 and that NU was now required to consolidate RMS into its financial statements. To consolidate RMS, NU eliminated the carrying value of its preferred stock investment in RMS and recorded the assets and liabilities of RMS. This adjustment resulted in a negative $4.7 million after-tax cumulative effect of an accounting change in the third quarter of 2003, and is summarized as follows (in millions of dollars):
Prior to the consolidation of RMS on July 1, 2003, NU recorded $1.4 million of pre-tax investment write-downs in 2003. After RMS was consolidated on July 1, 2003, $1.9 million of after-tax operating losses were included in earnings.
On June 30, 2004, RMS sold virtually all of its assets and liabilities for $3 million. NU recorded a gain totaling $0.8 million on the sale of RMS. Prior to the sale, RMS was consolidated into NU's financial statements and had after-tax operating losses totaling $1 million in 2004. These charges and gains are included in Note 1V, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Other Income/(Loss)," and in the other segment in Note 15, "Segment Information," to the consolidated financial statements.
NU has no other VIE's for which it is defined as the "primary beneficiary."
J.
Other Investments
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, NU maintained certain cost method and other investments. The cost method investments are comprised of NEON, a provider of optical networking services and Acumentrics, a developer of fuel cell and power quality equipment. Yankee Energy System, Inc. maintains the other investment, a long-term note receivable from BMC Energy LLC (BMC), an operator of renewable energy projects.
Under a 2002 common stock purchase agreement with NEON, NU invested $2.1 million in 2004 in exchange for an additional 341,000 shares of NEON common stock.
NEON:
On July 19, 2004, NEON and Globix Corporation (Globix) announced a definitive merger agreement in which Globix, an  unaffiliated publicly owned entity, would acquire NEON for shares of Globix common stock. The merger closed on March 8, 2005, and NU received 1.2748 shares of Globix common stock for each of the 2.1 million shares of NEON stock it owned. Management calculated the estimated fair value of its investment in NEON based on the Globix share price at December 31, 2004 and the conversion factor. Results of the calculation indicated that the fair value of NU's investment in NEON was below the carrying value at December 31, 2004 and was impaired. As a result, NU recorded a pre-tax write-down of $2.2 million.
In 2002, NU recorded an investment write-down of $14.6 million on a pre-tax basis to reduce the carrying value of the investment in NEON to its net realizable value at that time. NU's investment in NEON had a carrying value of $9.8 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Based on new information that affected the fair value of NU's investment in Acumentrics, management determined that the value of NU's investment declined in 2004 and that these declines were other than- temporary in nature. Total investment write-downs of $9.1 million on a pre-tax basis were recorded in 2004 to reduce the carrying value of the investment. The balance of this investment at December 31, 2003 totaled $9.5  million including an investment in Acumentrics debt securities of $2 million. During 2004, NU invested an additional $0.2 million in Acumentrics debt securities. At December 31, 2004, after the investment write-downs, NU's remaining investment in Acumentrics totaled $0.6 million in debt securities.
Acumentrics:
In late-March 2004, based on revised information that impacted undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value estimates, management determined that the fair value of the note receivable from BMC had declined and that the note was impaired. As a result, management recorded an investment write-down of $2.5 million on a pre-tax basis in the first quarter of 2004. NU's remaining note receivable from BMC, which management expects to collect from BMC, totaled $1.3 million and $4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
BMC:
The NEON, Acumentrics and BMC investment write-downs are included in other income/(loss) on the accompanying consolidated statement of income. For further information regarding other income/(loss), see Note 1V, "Other Income/(Loss)" to the consolidated financial statements.
K.
Depreciation
The provision for depreciation on utility assets is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated remaining useful lives of depreciable plant-in-service, which range primarily from 3 years to 75 years, adjusted for salvage value and removal costs, as approved by the appropriate regulatory agency where applicable. Depreciation rates are applied to plant-in-service from the time it is placed in service. When plant is retired from service, the original cost of the plant, including costs of removal less salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Cost of removal is classified as a regulatory liability. The depreciation rates for the several classes of electric utility plant-in-service are equivalent to a composite rate of 3.3 percent in 2004, 3.4 percent in 2003 and 3.2 percent in 2002.
NU also maintains other non-utility plant which is being depreciated using the straight-line method based on their estimated remaining useful lives, which range primarily from 15 years to 120 years. In 2002, NU Enterprises concluded a study of the depreciable lives of certain generation assets. The impact of this study was to lengthen the useful lives of those generation assets by 32 years to an average of 70 years. In addition, the useful lives of certain software was revised and shortened to reflect a remaining life of 1.5 years. Depreciation expense associated with these generation assets and software totaled $12.1 million in 2004, $14.2 million in 2003 and $17.7 million in 2002.
L.
Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
Regional Nuclear Companies: At December 31, 2004, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO own common stock in three regional nuclear companies (Yankee Companies). NU's ownership interests in the Yankee Companies at December 31, 2004, which are accounted for on the equity method are 49 percent of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC), 38.5 percent of the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and 20 percent of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC). In 2003, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO sold their collective 17 percent ownership interest in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation (VYNPC). NU's total equity investment in the Yankee Companies at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $28.6 million and $32.2 million, respectively. Earnings related to these equity investments are included in other income/(loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For further information, see Note 1V, "Other Income/(Los s)," to the consolidated financial statements. Each of the remaining Yankee Companies owns a single nuclear generating plant which is being decommissioned.
NU owns 49 percent of the common stock of CYAPC with a carrying value of $21.4 million at December 31, 2004. CYAPC is involved in litigation over the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel). Management believes that this litigation has not impaired the value of its investment in CYAPC at December 31, 2004 but will continue to evaluate the impact of the litigation on NU's investment. For further information regarding the Bechtel litigation, see Note 6E, "Commitments and Contingencies  Deferred Contractual Obligations," to the consolidated financial statements.
NU parent has a 22.66 percent equity ownership interest in two companies that transmit electricity imported from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. NU's investment and exposure to loss is $9.5 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Hydro-Quebec:
M.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
The allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a non-cash item that is included in the cost of Utility Group utility plant and represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of other interest expense and the cost of equity funds is recorded as other income on the consolidated statements of income as follows:
The average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula that develops an average rate using the cost of the company's short-term financings as well as the company's capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity). The average rate is applied to eligible construction work in progress amounts to calculate AFUDC.
N.
Equity-Based Compensation
NU maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and other long-term, equity-based incentive plans under the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan). NU accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. No equity-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share (EPS) if NU had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to equity-based employee compensation:
Net income as reported includes $3.8 million, $2 million and $1 million of expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. NU accounts for restricted stock in accordance with APB No. 25 and amortizes the intrinsic value of the award over the related service period.
NU assumes an income tax rate of 40 percent to estimate the tax effect on total equity-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value-based method for all awards.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, no stock options were awarded.
Under SFAS No. 123R, NU will be required to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on July 1, 2005, the effective date of SFAS No. 123R, and any new awards after that date. Management believes that the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not be material.
O.
Sale of Receivables
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, CL&P had sold an undivided interest in its accounts receivable of $90 million and $80 million, respectively, to a financial institution with limited recourse through CL&P Receivables Corporation (CRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of CL&P. CRC can sell up to $100 million of an undivided interest in its accounts receivable and unbilled revenues. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reserve requirements calculated in accordance with the Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement were $18.8 million and $29.3 million, respectively. These reserve amounts are deducted from the amount of receivables eligible for sale at the time. Concentrations of credit risk to the purchaser under this agreement with respect to the receivables are limited due to CL&P's diverse customer base within its service territory.
Utility Group:
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, amounts sold to CRC by CL&P but not sold to the financial institution totaling $139.4 million and $166.5 million, respectively, are included in investments in securitizable assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These amounts would be excluded from CL&P's assets in the event of CL&P's bankruptcy. On July 7, 2004, CRC renewed its Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement with CL&P and the financial institution through July 6, 2005, and the termination date of the facility was extended to July 3, 2007. CL&P's continuing involvement with the receivables that are sold to CRC and the financial institution is limited to the servicing of those receivables.
The transfer of receivables to the financial institution under this arrangement qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities  A Replacement of SFAS No. 125."
: SESI has a master purchase agreement with an unaffiliated third party under which SESI may sell certain monies due or to become due under delivery orders issued pursuant to federal government energy savings performance contracts. The sale of a portion of the future cash flow from the energy savings performance contract is used to reimburse the costs to construct the energy savings projects. SESI continues to provide performance period services under the contract with the government for the remaining term. The portion of future government payments for performance period services is not sold to the fund or recorded as a receivable until such services are rendered.
NU Enterprises
At December 31, 2004, SESI had sold $30 million of accounts receivable related to the installation of the energy efficiency projects, with limited recourse, under this master purchase agreement. Under the delivery order with the government, SESI is responsible for on-going maintenance and other services related to the energy efficiency project installation. SESI receives payment for those services in addition to the amounts sold under the master purchase agreement. NU has provided a guarantee that SESI will perform its obligations under the master purchase agreement and subsequent individual assignment agreements. The sale of the receivables to the unaffiliated third party qualifies for sales treatment under SFAS No. 140, and therefore these receivables are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
In 2004, SESI entered into assignment agreements to sell an additional $26.5 million of receivables upon completion of the installation of the energy savings projects in 2005. Until the construction is completed, the receivables are recorded under the percentage of completion method and included in the consolidated financial statements and the advances under the purchase agreement are recorded as debt.
P.
Asset Retirement Obligations
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143. This statement requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment be recognized as a liability at fair value when incurred and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made. SFAS No. 143 was effective on January 1, 2003 for NU. Management has completed its review process for potential asset retirement obligations (ARO) and has not identified any material AROs that have been incurred. However, management has identified certain removal obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business or have a low probability of occurring. These types of obligations primarily relate to transmission and distribution lines and poles, telecommunication towers, transmission cables, and certain FERC or state regulatory agency re-licensing issues. These obligations are AROs that have not been incurred or are not material in na ture.
On June 17, 2004, the FASB issued the proposed interpretation, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations." The proposed interpretation requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of an ARO that is conditional on a future event if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated and clarifies that there are no circumstances in which a law or regulation obligates an entity to perform retirement activities but then allows the entity to permanently avoid settling the obligation.
If adopted in its current form, there may be an impact to NU for AROs that NU currently concludes have not been incurred (conditional obligations). These conditional obligations may include utility poles and asbestos that, if removed or disturbed by construction or demolition, creates a disposal obligation. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of the interpretation on NU. The interpretation is scheduled to be issued in the first quarter of 2005 and would be effective for NU no later than December 31, 2005.
A portion of NU's regulated utilities' rates is intended to recover the cost of removal of certain utility assets. The amounts recovered do not represent AROs and are recorded as regulatory liabilities. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, cost of removal was approximately $328.8 million and $334 million, respectively.
Q.
Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies include materials purchased primarily for construction, operation and maintenance (O&M) purposes. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
R.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. At the end of each reporting period, overdraft amounts are reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to accounts
payable.
S.
Special Deposits
Special deposits represent amounts Select Energy has on deposit with unaffiliated counterparties and brokerage firms in the amount of $46.3 million and amounts included in escrow for SESI that have not been spent on construction projects of $20 million at December 31, 2004. Similar amounts totaled $17 million and $32 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Special deposits at December 31, 2004 also included $16.3 million in escrow for Yankee Gas. The $16.3 million represents Yankee Gas' June 1, 2005 first mortgage bond payment. Special deposits at December 31, 2003 also included $30.1 million in escrow that PSNH funded to acquire CVEC on January 1, 2004.
T.
Restricted Cash  LMP Costs
Restricted cash  LMP costs represents incremental locational marginal pricing (LMP) cost amounts that were collected by CL&P and deposited into an escrow account.
At December 31, 2003, restricted cash  LMP costs totaled $93.6 million, and an additional $30 million was deposited in 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, $83 million of the amount was paid to CL&P's standard offer suppliers in accordance with the FERC approved Standard Market Design (SMD) settlement. The remaining $41 million was released from the escrow account in the third quarter of 2004 and was refunded to CL&P's customers as a credit on bills from September to December of 2004.
U.
Excise Taxes
Certain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are collected by NU from its customers. These excise taxes are accounted for on a gross  basis with collections in revenues and payments in expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, gross receipts taxes, franchise taxes and other excise taxes of $97 million, $96.8 million, and $88.8 million, respectively, are included in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
V.
Other Income/(Loss)
The pre-tax components of NU's other income/(loss) items are as follows:
Investment income includes equity in earnings of regional nuclear generating and transmission companies of $2.6 million in 2004, $4.5 million in 2003 and $11.2 million in 2002. Equity in earnings relates to NU's investment in the Yankee Companies and the Hydro-Quebec system.
None of the amounts in either other income  other or other loss  other are individually significant.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information
X.
Marketable Securities
NU currently maintains two trusts that hold marketable securities. The trusts are used to fund NU's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and WMECO's prior spent nuclear fuel liability. NU's marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale, as defined by SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments and Debt and Equity Securities." Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are included in other income/(loss), in the consolidated statements of income.
For information regarding marketable securities, see Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
Y.
Counterparty Deposits
Balances collected from counterparties resulting from Select Energy's credit management activities totaled $57.7 million at December 31, 2004 and $46.5 million at December 31, 2003. These amounts are recorded as current liabilities and included as counterparty deposits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. To the extent Select Energy requires collateral from counterparties, cash is received as a part of the total collateral required. The right to receive such cash collateral in an unrestricted manner is determined by the terms of Select Energy's agreements. Key factors affecting the unrestricted status of a portion of this cash collateral include the financial standing of Select Energy and of NU as its credit supporter.
Z.
Provision for Uncollectible Accounts
NU maintains a provision for uncollectible accounts to record its receivables at an estimated net realizable value. This provision is determined based upon a variety of factors, including applying an estimated uncollectible account percentage to each receivables aging category, historical collection and write-off experience and management's assessment of individual customer collectibility. Management reviews at least quarterly the collectibility of the receivables, and if circumstances change, collectibility estimates are adjusted accordingly. Receivable balances are written-off against the provision for uncollectible accounts when these balances are deemed to be uncollectible.
2.
Short-Term Debt
The amount of short-term borrowings that may be incurred by NU and its operating companies is subject to periodic approval by either the SEC under the 1935 Act or by the respective state regulators. On June 30, 2004, the SEC granted authorization allowing NU, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas to incur total short-term borrowings up to a maximum of $450 million, $450 million, $100 million, $200 million, and $150 million, respectively, through June 30, 2007. The SEC also granted authorization for borrowing through the NU Money Pool (Pool).
Limits:
The charter of CL&P contains preferred stock provisions restricting the amount of unsecured debt that CL&P may incur. At meetings in November 2003, CL&P obtained authorization from its stockholders to issue unsecured indebtedness with a maturity of less than 10 years in excess of the 10 percent of total capitalization limitation in CL&P's charter, provided that all unsecured indebtedness would not exceed 20 percent of total capitalization for a ten-year period expiring March 2014. On March 18, 2004, the SEC approved this change in CL&P's charter. As of December 31, 2004, CL&P is permitted to incur $394.8 million of additional unsecured debt.
PSNH is authorized by the NHPUC to incur short-term borrowings up to a maximum of $100 million.
On November 8, 2004, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas entered into a 5-year unsecured revolving credit  facility for $400 million. This facility replaces a $300 million credit facility that expired on November 8, 2004. CL&P may draw up to $200 million, with PSNH, WMECO and Yankee Gas able to draw up to $100 million, subject to the $400 million maximum borrowing limit. Unless extended, the credit facility will expire on November 6, 2009. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were $80 million and $40 million, respectively, in borrowings under these credit facilities.
Utility Group Credit Agreement:
On November 8, 2004, NU entered into a 5-year unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit (LOC) facility for $500 million. This facility replaces a $350 million 364-day facility that expired on November 8, 2004. This facility provides a total commitment of $500 million which is available for advances, subject to an LOC sub-limit. Subject to the advances outstanding, LOCs may be issued in notional amounts up to $350 million for periods up to 364 days. The agreement provides for LOCs to be issued in the name of NU or any of its subsidiaries. This total commitment may be increased to $600 million, subject to approval, at the request of the borrower. Unless extended, the credit facility will expire on November 6, 2009.
NU Parent Credit Agreement:
Current SEC authorization permits borrowings up to a maximum of $450 million. On November 20, 2004, an application was filed with the SEC requesting an increase of maximum borrowings to $500 million, to match this facility limit. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were $100 million and $65 million, respectively, in borrowings under these credit facilities. In addition, there were $48.9 million and $106.9 million in LOCs outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Under the Utility Group and NU parent credit agreements, NU and its subsidiaries may borrow at fixed or variable rates plus an applicable margin based upon certain debt ratings, as rated by the lower of Standard and Poor's or Moody's Investors Service. The weighted average interest rates on NU's notes payable to banks outstanding on December 31, 2004 and 2003 were 4.53 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively.
Under the Utility Group and NU parent credit agreements, NU and its subsidiaries must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including but not limited to, consolidated debt ratios and interest coverage ratios. The most restrictive financial covenant is the interest coverage ratio. The parties to the credit agreements currently are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants.
Amounts outstanding under these credit facilities are classified as current liabilities as notes payable to banks on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as management anticipates that all borrowings under these credit facilities will be outstanding for no more than 364 days at any one time.
On June 30, 2004, E.S. Boulos Company (Boulos), a subsidiary of NGS, renewed its $6 million line of credit. This credit facility replaces a similar credit facility that expired on June 30, 2004, and unless extended, will expire on June 30, 2005. This credit facility limits Boulos' ability to pay dividends if borrowings are outstanding and limits access to the Pool for additional borrowings. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no borrowings under this credit facility.
Other Credit Facility:
3.
Derivative Instruments
Derivatives that are utilized for trading purposes are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. Other contracts that are derivatives but do not meet the definition of a cash flow hedge and cannot be designated as being used for normal purchases or normal sales are also recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. For those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative and meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in the fair value of the effective portion of those contracts are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions occur. For contracts that meet the definition of a derivative but do not meet the hedging requirements, and for the ineffective portion of contracts that meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in fair value of those contracts are recognized currently in earnings. Derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges and the item they are hedging are both recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative contracts that are entered into as a normal purchase or sale and will result in physical delivery, and are documented as such, are recognized in revenue and expense when such deliveries occur.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, a negative $57.8 million, net of tax, was reclassified as an expense from other comprehensive income in connection with the consummation of the underlying hedged transactions and recognized in earnings. Also during 2004, new cash flow hedge transactions were entered into that hedge cash flows through 2007. As a result of these new transactions and market value changes since January 1, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by $28.3 million, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2004, was a negative $3.5 million, net of tax (decrease to equity), relating to hedged transactions, and it is estimated that a negative $2.9 million included in this net of tax balance will be reclassified as a decrease to earnings within the next twelve months. Cash flows from hedge contracts are reported in the same category as cash flows from the underlying hedged tr ansaction.
There was a negative pre-tax impact of $0.5 million recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges. A negative pre-tax $0.6 million was recognized in 2004 earnings for the ineffective portion of fair value hedges. The changes in the fair value of both the fair value hedges and the natural gas inventory being hedged are recorded in fuel, purchased, and net interchange power on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
The tables below summarize current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The business activities of NU Enterprises that result in the recognition of derivative assets include concentrations of credit risk to energy marketing and trading counterparties. At December 31, 2004, Select Energy has $87.3 million of derivative assets from trading, non-trading, and hedging activities. These assets are exposed to counterparty credit risk. However, a significant portion of these assets is contracted with investment grade rated counterparties or collateralized with cash. The amounts below do not include option premiums paid, which are recorded as prepayments and amounted to $5.4 million and $9.1 million related to energy trading activities and $5.2 million and $7.6 million related to marketing activities at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. These amounts also do n ot include option premiums paid of $18.7 million related to non-trading gas options at December 31, 2004.
The amounts below also do not include option premiums received, which are recorded as other current liabilities and amounted to $7 million and $12.2 million related to energy trading activities at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, and $1.1 million related to marketing activities at December 31, 2004. Also not included at December 31, 2004, are option premiums received of $19 million related to non-trading gas options.
: To gather market intelligence and utilize this information in risk management activities for the wholesale marketing  activities, Select Energy conducts limited energy trading activities in electricity, natural gas, and oil, and therefore, experiences net open positions. Select Energy manages these open positions with strict policies that limit its exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures.
NU Enterprises  Trading
Derivatives used in trading activities are recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value are recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income in the period of change. The net fair value positions of the trading portfolio at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were assets of $29.6 million and $32.5 million, respectively.
Select Energy's trading portfolio includes New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures, financial swaps, and options, the fair value of which is based on closing exchange prices; over-the-counter forwards, financial swaps, and options, the fair value of which is based on the mid-point of bid and ask market prices; and bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, the fair value of which is determined using available information from external sources. Select Energy's trading portfolio also includes transmission congestion contracts (TCC). The fair value of the TCCs included in the trading portfolio is based on published market data.
Certain non-trading derivative contracts are used for delivery of energy related to Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing activities. Changes in fair value of a negative $79.4 million of non-trading derivative contracts were recorded primarily in expenses in 2004. Of the $79.4 million change in fair value, $77.7 million relates to natural gas hedges at December 31, 2004. These hedges are used to mitigate the risk of electricity price changes on Select Energy's fixed price electricity purchase contracts. These hedges do not meet criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges nor do they meet the normal purchase and sales exception and are accordingly accounted for at fair value as non-trading contracts. The contracts are natural gas contracts with fair values determined by prices provided by external sources and actively quoted markets. Select Energy held none of t hese contracts at December 31, 2003.
NU Enterprises  Non-Trading:
Market information for the TCCs classified as non-trading is not available, and those contracts cannot be reliably valued. Management believes the amounts paid for these contracts, which total $3.2 million at December 31, 2004, and $4.3 million at December 31, 2003 and are included in premiums paid, are equal to their fair value.
Select Energy utilizes derivative financial and commodity instruments, including futures and forward contracts, to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas purchased to meet firm sales and purchase commitments to certain customers. Select Energy also utilizes derivatives, including price swap agreements, call and put option contracts, and futures and forward contracts to manage the market risk associated with a portion of its anticipated supply and delivery requirements. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments and are used  to reduce the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity or natural gas. A derivative that hedges exposure to the variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (a cash flow hedge) is initially recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Cash flow hedges impact net income when the forecasted transaction being hedged occurs, when hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recorded, when the forecasted transaction being hedged is no longer probable of occurring, or when there is accumulated other comprehensive loss and the hedge and the forecasted transaction being hedged are in a loss position on a combined basis.
NU Enterprises  Hedging:
Select Energy maintains natural gas service agreements with certain customers to supply gas at fixed prices for terms extending through 2006. Select Energy has hedged its gas supply risk under these agreements through NYMEX futures contracts. Under these contracts, which also extend through 2006, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements. At December 31, 2004 the NYMEX futures contracts had notional values of $90.7 million and were recorded at fair value as derivative liabilities of $3.2 million.
Select Energy also maintains various physical and financial instruments to hedge its electric and gas purchases and sales through 2006. These instruments include forwards, futures, options, financial collars and swaps. These hedging contracts, which are valued at the mid-point of bid and ask market prices, were recorded as derivative assets of $3.7 million and derivative liabilities of $6.7 million at December 31, 2004.
Select Energy hedges certain amounts of natural gas inventory with gas futures, options and swaps, some of which are accounted for as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and natural gas inventory are recorded in earnings. The fair value of the futures, options and swaps were recorded as derivative assets of $0.8 million at December 31, 2004. The fair value of the hedged natural gas inventory was recorded as a reduction to fuel, materials and supplies of $1.5 million at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Select Energy recorded a negative pre-tax of $0.6 million in earnings related to its hedging instruments and natural gas inventory. In 2004, certain of these fair value hedges ere redesignated as cash flow hedges, and future changes in fair value during the hedge designation will be included in other comprehensive income (equity), unless ineffective.
Yankee Gas' non-trading derivatives consist of peaking supply arrangements to serve winter load obligations and firm sales contracts with options to curtail delivery. These contracts are subject to fair value accounting because these contracts are derivatives that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales, as defined, because of the optionality in the contract terms. Non-trading derivatives at December 31, 2004 included assets of $0.2 million and liabilities of $0.1 million.
Utility Group  Gas  Non-Trading:
Yankee Gas maintains a master swap agreement with a financial counterparty to purchase gas at fixed prices. Under this master swap agreement, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas for an unaffiliated customer is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements with that customer for a period not extending beyond 2005. At December 31, 2004, the commodity swap agreement had a notional value of $2.3 million and was recorded at fair value as a derivative asset of $1.5 million. The firm commitment contract that is hedged is also recorded as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair values of the hedge and firm commitment have offsetting impacts in earnings.
Utility Group  Gas  Hedging:
: CL&P has two IPP contracts to purchase power that contain pricing provisions that are not clearly and closely related to the price of power and therefore do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception. The fair values of these IPP non-trading derivatives at December 31, 2004 include a derivative asset with a fair value of $191.3 million and a derivative liability with a fair value of $47.2 million. An offsetting regulatory liability and an offsetting regulatory asset were recorded, as these contracts are part of the stranded costs, and management believes that these costs will continue to be recovered or refunded in rates.
Utility Group  Electric  Non-Trading
In March of 2003, NU parent entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on its $263 million, 7.25 percent fixed rate note that matures on April 1, 2012. As a matched-terms fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the swap and the hedged debt instrument are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets but are equal and offsetting in the consolidated statements of income. The cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged debt of $0.1 million is included as an increase to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The hedge is recorded as a derivative asset of $0.1 million. The resulting changes in interest payments made are recorded as adjustments to interest expense.

Employee Benefits
A.
Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions
NU's subsidiaries participate in a uniform noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Pension Plan) covering substantially all regular NU employees. Benefits are based on years of service and the employees' highest eligible compensation during 60 consecutive months of employment. Pre-tax pension expense/(income) was expense of $5.9 million in 2004, income of $31.8 million in 2003, and income of $73.4 million in 2002. These amounts exclude pension settlements, curtailments and net special termination benefit expense of $2.1 million in 2004 and income of $22.2 million in 2002. NU uses a December 31 measurement date for the Pension Plan. Pension (income)/expense attributable to earnings is as follows:
Pension Benefits:
: As a result of litigation with nineteen former employees, in April 2004, NU was ordered by the court to modify its retirement plan to include special retirement benefits for fifteen of these former employees retroactive to the dates of their retirement and increased future monthly benefit payments. In the third quarter of 2004, NU withdrew its appeal of the court's ruling. As a result, NU recorded $2.1 million in special termination benefits related to this litigation in 2004. NU made a lump sum benefit payment totaling $1.5 million to these former employees.
Pension Settlements, Curtailments and Special Termination Benefits
There were no settlements, curtailments or special termination benefits in 2003 and none in 2002 that impacted earnings.
On November 1, 2002, CL&P, NAEC and certain other joint owners consummated the sale of their ownership interests in Seabrook to a subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc. (FPL) and North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (NAESCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of NU, ceased having operational responsibility for Seabrook at that time. NAESCO employees were transferred to FPL, which significantly reduced the expected service lives of NAESCO employees who participated in the Pension Plan. As a result, NAESCO recorded pension curtailment income of $29.1 million in 2002. As the curtailment related to the operation of Seabrook, NAESCO credited the joint owners of Seabrook with this amount. CL&P recorded its $1.2 million share of this income as a reduction to stranded costs, and as such, there was no impact on 2002 CL&P earnings. PSNH was credited with its $10.5 million share of this income through the Seabrook Power Contracts with N AEC. PSNH also credited this income as a reduction to stranded costs, and as such, there was no impact on 2002 PSNH earnings.
Additionally, in conjunction with the divestiture of its generation assets, NU recorded $1.2 million in curtailment income in 2002, all of which was recorded as a regulatory liability and did not impact earnings.
Effective February 1, 2002, certain CL&P and Utility Group employees who were displaced were eligible for a Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP). The VRP supplements the Pension Plan and provides special provisions. Eligible employees include non-bargaining unit employees or employees belonging to a collective bargaining unit that has agreed to accept the VRP who are active participants in the Pension Plan at January 1, 2002, and that have been displaced as part of the reorganization between January 22, 2002 and March 2003. Eligible employees received a special retirement benefit under the VRP whose value was roughly equivalent to a multiple of base pay based on years of credited service. During 2002, NU recorded an expense of $8.1 million associated with special pension termination benefits related to the VRP. NU believes that the cost of the VRP is probable of recovery through regulated utility rates, and accordingly, the $8.1 million was recorded as a regulatory asset with no impact on 2002 earnings.
: NU bases the actuarial determination of pension plan income or expense on a market-related valuation of assets, which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation calculation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. Since the market-related valuation calculation recognizes gains or losses over a four-year period, the future value of the market-related assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized.
Market-Related Value of Pension Plan Assets
NU's subsidiaries also provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits through a benefit plan to retired employees (PBOP Plan). These benefits are available for employees retiring from NU who have met specified service requirements. For current employees and certain retirees, the total benefit is limited to two times the 1993 per retiree health care cost. These costs are charged to expense over the estimated work life of the employee. NU uses a December 31 measurement date for the PBOP Plan.
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions:
st
NU annually funds postretirement costs through external trusts with amounts that have been rate-recovered and which also are tax deductible. Currently, there are no pending regulatory actions regarding postretirement benefit costs and there are no postretirement benefit costs that are deferred as regulatory assets.
On December 8, 2003, the President signed into law a bill that expands Medicare, primarily by adding a prescription drug benefit starting in 2006 for Medicare-eligible retirees as well as a federal subsidy to plan sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans who provide a prescription drug benefit at least actuarially equivalent to the new Medicare benefit.
Impact of New Medicare Changes on PBOP:
Based on the current PBOP Plan provisions, NU's actuaries believe that NU will qualify for this federal subsidy because the actuarial value of NU's PBOP Plan is estimated to be 60 percent greater than that of the standard Medicare benefit. NU will directly benefit from the federal subsidy for retirees of PSNH and NAESCO who retired before 1993, and other NU retirees who retired before 1991. For other retirees, management does not believe that NU will benefit from the subsidy because NU's cost support for these retirees is capped at a fixed dollar commitment.
Based on the most recent actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2004, the impact of the Medicare program has been revised from a $19.5 million decrease in the PBOP benefit obligation at December 31, 2003 to $27 million at January 1, 2004. The total $27 million decrease consists of $20 million as a direct result of the subsidy for certain non-capped retirees and $7 million related to changes in participation assumptions for capped retirees and future retirees as a result of the subsidy. The total $27 million decrease is currently being amortized as a reduction to PBOP expense over approximately 13 years. For the year ended December 31, 2004, this reduction in PBOP expense totaled approximately $3.6 million, including amortization of the actuarial gain of $2 million and a reduction in interest cost and service cost based on a lower PBOP benefit obligation of $1.6 million.
There were no settlements, curtailments or special termination benefits in 2004 or 2003.
PBOP Settlements, Curtailments and Special Termination Benefits:
In 2002, NU recorded PBOP special termination benefits income of $1.2 million related to the sale of Seabrook. CL&P and PSNH recorded their shares of this curtailment as reductions to stranded costs.
The following table represents information on the plans' benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and the respective plans' funded status:
The accumulated benefit obligation for the Plan was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The following actuarial assumptions were used in calculating the plans' year end funded status:
The components of net periodic (income)/expense are as follows:
For calculating pension and postretirement benefit income and expense amounts, the following assumptions were used:
The following table represents the PBOP assumed health care cost trend rate for the next year and the assumed ultimate trend rate:
The annual per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed to decrease by one percentage point each year through 2007.  
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  The effect of changing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would have the following effects:
NU's investment strategy for its Pension Plan and PBOP Plan is to maximize the long-term rate of return on those plans' assets within an acceptable level of risk. The investment strategy establishes target allocations, which are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced. NU's expected long-term rates of return on Pension Plan assets and PBOP Plan assets are based on these target asset allocation assumptions and related expected long-term rates of return. In developing its expected long-term rate of return assumptions for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan, NU also evaluated input from actuaries and consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and NU's historical 20-year compounded return of approximately 11 percent. The Pension Plan's and PBOP Plan's target asset allocation assumptions and expected long-term rate of return assumptions by asset category are as follows:
The actual asset allocations at December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximated these target asset allocations.  The plans' actual weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows:  
:  The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid for the Pension and PBOP Plans:
Estimated Future Benefit Payments
Government subsidy represents amounts expected to be received from the federal government for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit under the PBOP Plan.
NU does not expect to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2005 and expects to make $50.3 million in contributions to the PBOP Plan in 2005.
Contributions:
Currently, NU's policy is to annually fund an amount at least equal to that which will satisfy the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Internal Revenue Code.
Postretirement health plan assets for non-union employees are subject to federal income taxes.
B.
401(k) Savings Plan
NU maintains a 401(k) Savings Plan for substantially all NU employees. This savings plan provides for employee contributions up to specified limits. NU matches employee contributions up to a maximum of three percent of eligible compensation with one percent cash and two percent NU shares. The 401(k) matching contributions of cash and NU shares made by NU were $10.5 million in 2004, $9.9 million in 2003 and $11.1 million in 2002.
C.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan
NU maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for purposes of allocating shares to employees participating in the NU's 401(k) Savings Plan. Under this arrangement, NU issued unsecured notes during 1991 and 1992 totaling $250 million, the proceeds of which were loaned to the ESOP trust (ESOP Notes) for the purchase of 10.8 million newly issued NU common shares (ESOP shares). The ESOP trust is obligated to make principal and interest payments to NU on the ESOP Notes at the same rate that ESOP shares are allocated to employees. NU makes annual contributions to the ESOP trust equal to the ESOP's debt service, less dividends received by the ESOP. NU's contribution to the ESOP trust totaled $12 million in 2004, $14.7 million in 2003 and $16.4 million in 2002. Interest expense on the unsecured notes was $5.7 million, $7.6 million and $9.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For the years ended Decembe r 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, NU recognized $7.3 million, $6.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of expense related to the ESOP, excluding the interest expense on the unsecured notes.
All dividends received by the ESOP on unallocated shares are used to pay debt service and are not considered dividends for financial reporting purposes. During the first and second quarters of 2003, NU paid a $0.1375 per share quarterly dividend. During the third quarter of 2003 through the second quarter of 2004, NU paid a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend. NU paid a $0.1625 per share dividend during the third and fourth quarters of 2004.
In 2004 and 2003, the ESOP trust issued 567,907 and 607,020 of NU common shares, respectively, to satisfy 401(k) Savings Plan obligations to employees. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, total allocated ESOP shares were 8,183,711 and 7,615,804, respectively, and total unallocated ESOP shares were 2,616,474 and 3,184,381, respectively. The fair market value of the unallocated ESOP shares at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $49.3 and $64.2 million, respectively.
D.
Equity-Based Compensation
Impact of SFAS No. 123R: SFAS No. 123R will require NU to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees on or after July 1, 2005. NU is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 123R on the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) and the Incentive Plan. Management believes that the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not be material. See Note 1C, "New Accounting Standards," for more information on SFAS No. 123R.
Since July 1998, NU has maintained an ESPP for all eligible employees. Under the ESPP, NU common shares are purchased at 6-month intervals at 85 percent of the lower of the price on the first or last day of each 6-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 25 percent of their compensation as of the beginning of the purchase period. During 2004 and 2003, employees purchased 194,838 and 225,985 shares, respectively, at discounted prices of $14.17 and $15.90 in 2004 and $12.20 in 2003. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, 1,390,403 shares and 1,585,241 shares remained registered for future issuance under the ESPP, respectively.
Employee Share Purchase Plan:
Incentive Plans: Under the Incentive Plan, NU is authorized to grant various types of awards, including restricted stock, performance units, restricted stock units, and stock options to eligible employees and board members. The number of shares that may be utilized for grants and awards during a given calendar year may not exceed the aggregate of one percent of the total number of shares of NU common shares outstanding as of the first day of that calendar year and the shares not utilized in previous years. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, NU had 1,361,528 and 1,649,268 shares of common stock, respectively, registered for issuance under the Incentive Plan.
During 2004, NU granted 25,000 shares and 382,395 units of restricted stock and restricted stock units, respectively, under the Incentive Plan. The restricted shares granted in 2004 had a fair value of $0.4 million and were recorded as an offset to shareholders' equity. The restricted stock units granted in 2004 had a fair value of $7.4 million and were recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During 2003, NU granted 383,589 shares of restricted stock under the Incentive Plan shares. Also during 2003, 75,000 restricted stock units were granted, all of which were forfeited January 1, 2004. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $3.8 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively, was expensed related to restricted stock and restricted stock units.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:
Under the Incentive Plan, NU also granted 30,122, 35,303 and 38,847 performance units during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The performance units vest ratably over three years and will be paid in cash at the end of the vesting period. NU records a liability for the performance units based on the achievement of the performance unit goals. A liability of $3.2 million and $1.5 million was recorded at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for these performance units. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $1.7 million, $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, was recorded as an expense related to these performance units.
Performance Units:
Prior to 2003, NU granted stock options to certain employees. The exercise price of stock options, as set at the time of grant, was equal to the fair market value per share at the date of grant, and therefore no equity-based compensation cost was reflected in net income. No stock options were granted during 2004 or 2003. A summary of stock option transactions is as follows:
Stock Options:
For certain options that were granted in 2002, the vesting schedule for these options is ratably over three years from the date of grant. Additionally, certain options granted in 2002 vest 50 percent at the date of grant and 50 percent one year from the date of grant, while other options granted in 2002 vest 100 percent after five years.
The fair value of each stock option grant has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions. No stock options were granted during 2004 or 2003.
The weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during 2002 was $5.64. The weighted average remaining contractual lives for the options outstanding at December 31, 2004 is 6.03 years.
In January 2005, 490,600 options that were outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2004 with exercise prices ranging from $18.4375 to $21.03 were forfeited. This forfeiture resulted in outstanding and exercisable options in January 2005 of 1,503,142 and 1,386,995, respectively.
For additional information regarding equity-based compensation, see Note 1N, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Equity-Based Compensation."
E.
Supplemental Executive Retirement and Other Plans
NU has maintained a SERP since 1987. The SERP provides its participants, who are executives of NU, with benefits that would have been provided to them under NU's retirement plan if certain Internal Revenue Code and other limitations were not imposed. The SERP liability of $24.2 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, represents NU's actuarially-determined obligation under the SERP. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $4 million, $3.9 million, and $3.8 million, respectively, was expensed related to the SERP.
The SERP is the only NU retirement plan for which a minimum pension liability has been recorded. Recording this minimum pension liability resulted in a reduction of $0.1 million to accumulated other comprehensive income.
NU maintains a plan for retirement and other benefits for certain current and past company officers. The actuarially-determined liability for this plan was $36.7 million and $35.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $4.5 million, $6.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively, was expensed related to this plan.
For further information regarding SERP investments, see Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
5.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives be reviewed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. NU uses October 1st as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Excluding adjustments to the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Woods Electrical and Woods Network recorded in 2003, there were no impairments or adjustments to the goodwill balances during 2004 or 2003. The Woods Electrical and Woods Network adjustments primarily related to the reclassification between goodwill and intangible assets.
NU's reporting units that maintain goodwill are generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 15, "Segment Information," to the consolidated financial statements. Consistent with the way management reviews the operating results of its reporting units, NU's reporting units under the NU Enterprises reportable segment include: 1) the merchant energy reporting unit and 2) the energy services reporting unit. The merchant energy reporting unit is comprised of the operations of Select Energy, NGC and the generation operations of HWP, while the energy services reporting unit is comprised of the operations of SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, NGS and Woods Network. As a result, NU's reporting units that maintain goodwill are as follows: the Yankee Gas reporting unit, which is classified under the Utility Group  gas reportable segment; the merchant energy re porting unit, which is classified under the NU Enterprises  merchant energy reportable segment; and the energy services reporting unit, which is classified under NU Enterprises  services and other.
NU has completed its impairment analyses as of October 1, 2004, for all reporting units that maintain goodwill and has determined that no impairment exists. In completing these analyses, the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using both discounted cash flow methodologies and an analysis of comparable companies or transactions.
At December 31, 2004, NU maintained $319.9 million of goodwill that is no longer being amortized, $10.8 million of identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization and $8.5 million of intangible assets not subject to amortization. At December 31, 2003, NU maintained $319.9 million of goodwill that is no longer being amortized, $14.4 million of identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization and $8.5 million of intangible assets not subject to amortization. A summary of NU's goodwill balances at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, by reportable segment and reporting unit is as follows:
The goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of Yankee Gas is not being recovered from the customers of Yankee Gas.
At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, NU's intangible assets and accumulated amortization, all of which relates to NU Enterprises, consisted of the following:
NU recorded amortization expense of $3.6 million and $3.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to these intangible assets. Substantially all of the intangible assets subject to amortization are being amortized over a period of 8.5 years.
Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated annual amortization expense for each of the succeeding 5 years from 2005 through 2009 is $3.6 million in 2005 through 2007 and no amortization expense in 2008 or 2009. These amounts may vary as acquisitions and dispositions occur in the future.

Commitments and Contingencies
A.
Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters
Connecticut:
: The CTA allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and IPP over market costs, while the SBC allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2004, CL&P filed its 2003 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which compares CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements. A final decision in the 2003 CTA and SBC docket was issued on August 4, 2004 and ordered a refund to customers of $88.5 million over a seven-month period beginning with October 2004 consumption.
In the 2001 CTA and SBC reconciliation filing, and subsequently in a September 10, 2002 petition to reopen related proceedings, CL&P requested that a deferred intercompany tax liability associated with the intercompany sale of generation assets be excluded from the calculation of CTA revenue requirements. On September 10, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision denying CL&P's request, and on October 24, 2003, CL&P appealed the DPUC's final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court. The appeal has been fully briefed and argued. A decision from the court is not expected to be issued until the second quarter of 2005. If CL&P's request is granted through these court proceedings, then there could be additional amounts due to CL&P from its customers. The 2004 impact of including the deferred intercompany liability in CTA revenue requirements has been a reduction of approximately $19.3 million in r evenue.
New Hampshire:
The SCRC allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs. On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year. This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues billed with stranded costs, and transition energy service and default energy service (TS/DS) revenues billed with TS/DS costs. The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of PSNH's generation operations. The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $208.6 million at December 31, 2004.  This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of non-securitized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $411.3 million to $202.7 million.
SCRC Reconciliation Filings:
The 2003 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on April 30, 2004, and a stipulation and settlement agreement between PSNH, the Office of Consumer Advocate and NHPUC staff was filed with the NHPUC on October 4, 2004. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, no costs related to the recovery of stranded costs or the cost of providing transition energy service were disallowed and the NHPUC staff agreed to accept the 2003 SCRC filing without change. On October 29, 2004, the NHPUC issued an order accepting the settlement agreement as filed.
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing is expected to be filed with the NHPUC by May 2, 2005. Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis. On May 2, 2005, PSNH expects to file its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation that will include a request to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process. This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting. At December 31, 2004, the PSNH unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively. If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs. Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2004, WMECO filed its 2003 transition cost reconciliation with the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE). This filing reconciled the recovery of generation-related stranded costs for calendar year 2003. The DTE has not initiated its investigation into this filing. WMECO expects to file its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the DTE on March 31, 2005. The DTE has combined the 2003 transition cost reconciliation filing and the 2004 transition cost reconciliation filing into a single proceeding. The timing of this decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, but management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.

Environmental Matters
NU is subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effect of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or the remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current and former operating sites. As such, NU has an active environmental auditing and training program and believes that it is substantially in compliance with all enacted laws and regulations.
General:
Environmental reserves are accrued using a probabilistic model approach when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The probabilistic model approach estimates the liability based on the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options, including, no action is required or several different remedies ranging from establishing institutional controls to full site remediation and monitoring.
These estimates are subjective in nature as they take into consideration several different remediation options at each specific site. The reliability and precision of these estimates can be affected by several factors including new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors.
The amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs and takes into consideration site assessment and remediation costs. Based on currently available information for estimated site assessment and remediation costs at December 31, 2004 and 2003, NU had $38.7 million and $40.8 million, respectively, recorded as environmental reserves. A reconciliation of the total reserve amount at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:
NU currently has 53 sites included in the environmental reserve. of those 53 sites, 25 sites are in the remediation or long-term monitoring phase, 22 sites have had site assessments completed and the remaining six sites are in the preliminary stages of site assessment.
For nine sites that are included in the company's liability for environmental costs, the information known and nature of the remediation options at those sites allow an estimate of the range of losses to be made. These sites primarily relate to manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. At December 31, 2004, $8.1 million has been accrued as a liability for these sites, which represents management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs. This amount differs from an estimated range of loss from $4.9 million to $25.8 million as management utilizes the probabilistic model approach to make its estimate of the liability for environmental costs. For the 45 remaining sites for which an estimate is based on the probabilistic model approach, determining a range of estimated losses is not possible.
These liabilities are estimated on an undiscounted basis and do not assume that any amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties. The environmental reserve includes sites at different stages of discovery and remediation and does not include any unasserted claims.
At December 31, 2004, there are ten sites for which there are unasserted claims; however, any related remediation costs are not probable or estimable at this time. NU's environmental liability also takes into account recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and pollutants, mandated expenditures to remediate previously contaminated sites and any other infrequent and non-recurring clean up costs.
MGP sites comprise the largest portion of NU's environmental liability. MGPs are sites that manufactured gas from coal produced certain byproducts that may pose risk to human health and the environment. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $33.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively, represent amounts for the site assessment and remediation of MGPs. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the five largest MGP sites  comprise approximately 58 percent and 57 percent, respectively, of the total MGP environmental liability.
MGP Sites:
At December 31, 2004, NU has one site that is held for sale. The site, a former MGP site, is currently held for sale under a pending purchase and sale agreement. NU is currently remediating the property and has been deferring the costs associated with those remediation efforts as allowed by a regulatory order. At December 31, 2004, NU had $7.9 million related to remediation efforts at the property and other sale costs recorded in other deferred debits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. A final decision was reached by the DPUC on January 19, 2005, which approved the sale proceedings of the former MGP site. The final decision approved the price of $24 million for the sale of the land and also approved the deferral of the gain in the amount of $13.8 million ($8.3 million after-tax). The purchase and sale agreement releases NU from all environmental claims arising out of or in connection with the property.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and its amendments or state equivalents impose joint and several strict liabilities, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances resulting in removal and remediation costs and environmental damages. Liabilities under these laws can be material and in some instances may be imposed without regard to fault or for past acts that may have been lawful at the time they occurred. NU has five superfund sites under CERCLA for which it has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party (PRP). For sites where there are other PRPs and NU's subsidiaries are not managing the site assessment and remediation, the liability accrued represents NU's estimate of what it will need to pay to settle its obligations with respect to the site.
CERCLA Matters:
It is possible that new information or future developments could require a reassessment of the potential exposure to related environmental matters. As this information becomes available management will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the reserves accordingly, as necessary.
PSNH and Yankee Gas have rate recovery mechanisms for environmental costs. CL&P recovers a certain level of environmental costs currently in rates but does not have an environmental cost recovery tracking mechanism. Accordingly, changes in CL&P's environmental reserves impact CL&P's earnings. WMECO does not have a regulatory mechanism to recover environmental costs from its customers, and changes in WMECO's environmental reserves impact WMECO's earnings.

Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act), CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and NAEC must pay the DOE for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. For nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983 (Prior Period Fuel) for CL&P and WMECO, an accrual has been recorded for the full liability, and payment must be made prior to the first delivery of spent fuel to the DOE. Until such payment is made, the outstanding balance will continue to accrue interest at the 3-month treasury bill yield rate. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, fees due to the DOE for the disposal of Prior Period Fuel were $259.7 million and $256.4 million, respectively, including interest costs of $177.6 million and $174.3 million, respectively.
During 2004, WMECO established a trust, which holds marketable securities, to fund amounts due to the DOE for the disposal of WMECO's prior period fuel. For further information on this trust see Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
D.
Long-Term Contractual Arrangements
Previously under the terms of their agreements, NU's companies paid their ownership (or entitlement) shares of costs, which included depreciation, O&M expenses, taxes, the estimated cost of decommissioning, and a return on invested capital to VYNPC and recorded these costs as purchased-power expenses. On July 31, 2002, VYNPC consummated the sale of its nuclear generating unit to a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (Entergy) for approximately $180 million. Under the terms of the sale, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will continue to buy approximately 16 percent of the plant's output through March 2012 at a range of fixed prices. The total cost of purchases under contracts with VYNPC amounted to $26.8 million in 2004, $29.9 million in 2003 and $27.6 million in 2002.
VYNPC:
: CL&P, PSNH and WMECO have entered into various arrangements for the purchase of electricity. The total cost of purchases under these arrangements amounted to $323.3 million in 2004, $283.4 million in 2003 and $278.3 million in 2002. These amounts relate to IPP contracts and do not include contractual commitments related to CL&P's standard offer, PSNH's short-term power supply management or WMECO's standard offer and default service.
Electricity Procurement Contracts
Yankee Gas has entered into long-term contracts for the purchase of a specified quantity of natural gas in the normal course of business as part of its portfolio to meet its actual sales commitments. These contracts have expiration dates in 2006 and 2007. The total cost of Yankee Gas' procurement portfolio, including these contracts, amounted to $250.5 million in 2004, $218.6 million in 2003 and $158 million in 2002.
Natural Gas Procurement Contracts:
Along with other New England utilities, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and HWP have entered into agreements to support transmission and terminal facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and HWP are obligated to pay, over 30-year period ending in 2020, their proportionate shares of the annual O&M expenses and capital costs of those facilities. The total cost of these agreements amounted to $23.7 million in 2004, $25.3 million in 2003 and $26 million in 2002.
Hydro-Quebec:
In 2004, Yankee Gas signed a contract for the design and building of the LNG facility. Yankee Gas anticipates that the facility will become operational in late 2007 in time for the 2007/2008 heating season. Certain future estimated construction expenditures totaling $21.4 million are not included in the contract signed to build the LNG facility and are not included in the following table of estimated future annual Utility Group costs. The remaining $21.4 million does not include $12.9 million that was spent through 2004.
Yankee Gas Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Storage Facility:
In October 2004, PSNH received the approvals necessary to begin construction related to the conversion of one of three 50 megawatt units at the coal-fired Schiller Station to burn wood. Construction of the $75 million Northern Wood Power Project has begun and is expected to be completed by late 2006. Certain other estimated construction expenditures totaling $8.6 million are not included in the contract signed to perform the Schiller Station conversion and are not included in the table of estimated future annual Utility Group costs below.
Northern Wood Power Project:
: NU has significant decommissioning and plant closure cost obligations to the Yankee Companies. Each plant has been shut down and is undergoing decommissioning. The Yankee Companies collect decommissioning and closure costs through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including NU's electric utility companies CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. These companies in turn pass these costs on to their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. YAEC and MYAPC received FERC approval to collect all presently estimated decommissioning costs. The table of estimated future annual Utility Group costs below includes the decommissioning and closure costs for YAEC, MYAPC and CYAPC.
Yankee Companies FERC-Approved Billings
: The estimated future annual costs of NU's significant long-term contractual arrangements are as follows:
Estimated Future Annual Utility Group Costs
Select Energy maintains long-term agreements to purchase energy in the normal course of business as part of its portfolio of resources to meet its actual or expected sales commitments.  The aggregate amount of these purchase contracts was $6.2 billion at December 31, 2004 as follows:  
NU Enterprises Purchase Agreements:  
Select Energy's purchase contract amounts can exceed the amount expected to be reported in fuel, purchased and net interchange power because energy trading transactions are classified in revenues.
The amounts and timing of Select Energy's purchase agreements could be impacted by the NU Enterprises' strategic review.
E.
Deferred Contractual Obligations
CYAPC's estimated decommissioning and plant closure costs for the period 2000 through 2023 have increased by approximately $395 million over the April 2000 estimate of $436 million approved by the FERC in a 2000 rate case settlement. The revised estimate reflects the increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, increased security and liability and property insurance costs, and the fact that CYAPC is now self-performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel in July 2003. NU's share of CYAPC's increase in decommissioning and plant closure costs is approximately $194 million. On July 1, 2004, CYAPC filed with the FERC for recovery of these increased costs. In the filing, CYAPC sought to increase its annual decommissioning collections from $16.7 million to $93 million for a six-year period beginning on January 1, 2005. On August 30, 2004, the FERC issued an order accepting the rates, with collection beginning on February 1, 2005, subject to refund, and scheduled hearings for May 2005. In total, NU's estimated remaining decommissioning and plant closure obligation for CYAPC is $308.7 million at December 31, 2004.
On June 10, 2004, the DPUC and Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed a petition seeking a declaratory order that CYAPC be allowed to recover all decommissioning costs from its wholesale purchasers, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, but that such purchasers may not be allowed to recover in their retail rates any costs that the FERC might determine to have been imprudently incurred. On August 30, 2004, the FERC denied this petition. On September 29, 2004, the DPUC and OCC asked the FERC to reconsider the petition. On October 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order granting further consideration regarding the DPUC's and OCC's petition for reconsideration. No hearing date has been established for this reconsideration.
On February 22, 2005, the DPUC filed testimony with the FERC. In its filed testimony, the DPUC argues that approximately $215 million to $225 million of CYAPC's requested increase is due to CYAPC's imprudence in managing the decommissioning project while Bechtel was the contractor. Therefore, the DPUC recommends a total disallowance of between $225 million to $234 million. Hearings are scheduled to begin on June 1, 2005. NU's share of the DPUC's recommended disallowance is between $110 million to $115 million.
CYAPC is currently in litigation with Bechtel over the termination of its decommissioning contract. On June 13, 2003, CYAPC gave notice of the termination of its contract with Bechtel for the decommissioning of its nuclear power plant. CYAPC terminated the contract due to Bechtel's incomplete and untimely performance and refusal to perform the remaining decommissioning work. Bechtel has departed the site and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process.
On June 23, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC asserting a number of claims and seeking a variety of remedies, including monetary and punitive damages and rescission of the contract. Bechtel has since amended its complaint to add claims for wrongful termination. On August 22, 2003, CYAPC filed its answer and counterclaims, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing. Discovery is currently underway and a trial has been scheduled for May 2006.
In the prejudgment remedy proceeding before the Connecticut Supreme Court (the Court), Bechtel sought garnishment of the CYAPC decommissioning trust and related payments. In October 2004, Bechtel and CYAPC entered into an agreement under which Bechtel waived its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYAPC's real property in Connecticut and the escrowing of $41.7 million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to CYAPC through June 30, 2007 in respect to CYAPC's common equity. This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be implemented until the Court found that such assets were subject to attachment. CYAPC has contested the attachability of such assets. The DPUC is an intervener in this proceeding.
Management cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding required for the collection of the increased CYAPC decommissioning costs. Management believes that the costs have been prudently incurred and will ultimately be recovered from the customers of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO. However, there is a risk that some portion of these increased costs may not be recovered, or will have to be refunded if recovered, as a result of the FERC proceedings. NU also cannot predict the timing and the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
The Yankee Companies also filed litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983 under the Act. Under the Act, the DOE was to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear plants of YAEC, MYAPC and CYAPC no later than January 31, 1998 in return for payments by each company into the nuclear waste fund. No fuel has been collected by the DOE, and spent nuclear fuel is stored on the sites of the Yankee Companies' plants. YAEC, MYAPC and CYAPC collected the funds for payments into the nuclear waste fund from wholesale utility customers under FERC-approved contract rates. The wholesale utility customers in turn collect these payments from their retail electric customers. The Yankee Companies' individual damage claims attributed to the government's breach totaling $548 million are specific to each plant and include incremental storage, security, const ruction and other costs through 2010, which is the earliest date the DOE projects that it will begin removing nuclear fuel. The YAEC damage claim is $191 million, the MYAPC claim is $160 million and the CYAPC claim is $197 million.
The DOE trial ended on August 31, 2004 and a verdict has not been reached. The current Yankee Companies' rates do not include an amount for recovery of damages in this matter. Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
F.
NRG Energy, Inc. Exposures
Certain subsidiaries of NU, including CL&P and Yankee Gas, have entered into transactions with NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) and certain of its subsidiaries. On May 14, 2003, NRG and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions. On December 5, 2003, NRG emerged from bankruptcy. NU's NRG-related exposures as a result of these transactions relate to 1) the recovery of congestion charges incurred by NRG prior to the implementation of SMD on March 1, 2003, 2) the recovery of CL&P's station service billings from NRG, and 3) the recovery of Yankee Gas' and CL&P's expenditures that were incurred related to an NRG subsidiary's generating plant construction project that is now abandoned. While it is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these issues, management does not expect their resolution will have a material adverse effect on NU's consolidated financial condition or re sults of operations.

Impacts of Decision to Exit NU Enterprises' Wholesale Marketing Contracts and to Explore Ways to Divest the NU Enterprises' Services Businesses
The March 2005 decision to exit NU Enterprises' wholesale marketing business and to explore ways to divest NU Enterprises' services businesses creates certain potential loss contingencies. They could be material and could include:
The impairment of long-lived assets if they are no longer held and used and become held for sale at expected sales prices that are less than carrying values.
The impairment of goodwill if expected cash flows that support the fair values of the reporting units that hold goodwill are reduced significantly by a change in business strategy or a decision to sell all or portions of the reporting units at prices less than carrying values.
The impairment of intangible assets if expected cash flows that support them are reduced to below their carrying values.
The recognition of closure costs such as severance, benefit plan curtailments, and lease termination payments.
The recognition of losses associated with settling energy contracts currently accounted for on an accrual method of accounting that have negative fair values at the time of settlement.
The termination of the normal purchase and sales exception to fair value accounting for derivatives and the resulting recognition of losses or gains on changes in fair value of the contracts since inception.
NU expects to record a charge in the first quarter of 2005 associated with the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses. The level of that charge will depend on a number of factors, including how the  disposition of those businesses is accomplished.
H.
Consolidated Edison, Inc. Merger Litigation
Certain gain and loss contingencies exist with regard to the merger agreement between NU and Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison) and the related litigation.
On March 5, 2001, Con Edison advised NU that it was unwilling to close its merger with NU on the terms set forth in the parties' 1999 merger agreement (Merger Agreement). On March 12, 2001, NU filed suit against Con Edison seeking damages in excess of $1 billion.
On May 11, 2001, Con Edison filed an amended complaint seeking damages for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation in an unspecified amount, but which Con Edison's Chief Financial Officer has testified is at least $314 million. NU disputes both Con Edison's entitlement to any damages as well as its method of computing its alleged damages.
The companies completed discovery in the litigation and submitted cross motions for summary judgment. The court denied Con Edison's motion in its entirety, leaving intact NU's claim for breach of the Merger Agreement, and partially granted NU's motion for summary judgment by eliminating Con Edison's claims against NU for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
An intervener in this litigation has made the claim that NU shareholders at March 5, 2001 are entitled to damages from Con Edison, if any, and not current NU shareholders.
Appeals on this and other issues are now pending and no trial date has been set. At this stage of the litigation, management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate effect on NU.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each of the following financial instruments:
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these cash items.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash  LMP, and Special Deposits:
Investments held for the benefit of the SERP are recorded at fair market value based upon quoted market prices. The investments having a cost basis of $50.1 million and $33.8 million held for benefit of the SERP were recorded at their fair market values at December 31, 2004 and 2003, of $55.1 million and $36.9 million, respectively. For further information regarding the SERP liabilities and related investments, see Note 4E, "Employee Benefits  Supplemental Executive Retirement and Other Plans," and Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
SERP Investments:
Prior Spent Nuclear Fuel Trust: During 2004, WMECO established a trust to fund the amounts due to the DOE for its prior spent nuclear fuel  obligation. These investments having a cost basis of $49.5 million were recorded at their fair market value at December 31, 2004 of $49.3 million. For further information regarding these investments, see Note 8, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements.
The fair value of NU's fixed-rate securities is based upon the quoted market price for those issues or similar issues. Adjustable rate securities are assumed to have a fair value equal to their carrying value. The carrying amounts of NU's financial instruments and the estimated fair values are as follows:
Preferred Stock, Long-Term Debt and Rate Reduction Bonds:
Other long-term debt includes $259.7 million and $256.4 million of fees and interest due for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Other Financial Instruments: The carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities, including investments in securitizable assets, approximates their fair value.

Marketable Securities
The following is a summary of NU's available-for-sale securities related to NU's SERP securities which are included in deferred debits and other assets - other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and WMECO's prior spent nuclear fuel trust:
At December 31, 2004 and 2003 NU has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position and has determined that none of the related unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary in nature.
For information related to the change in net unrealized holding gains and losses included in shareholders' equity, see Note 12, "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)," to the consolidated financial statements.
For years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, realized gains and losses recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities are as follows (in millions):
NU utilizes the specific identification basis method for the SERP securities and the average cost basis method for the WMECO prior spent nuclear fuel trust to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of available for- sale securities.
Proceeds from the sale of these securities totaled $56.7 million, $34.1 million, and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
At December 31, 2004, the contractual maturities of the available-for sale securities are as follows (in millions):
For further information regarding marketable securities, see Note 1X, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Marketable Securities" to the consolidated financial statements.
9.
Leases
NU has entered into lease agreements, some of which are capital leases, for the use of data processing and office equipment, vehicles, and office space. The provisions of these lease agreements generally provide for renewal options. Certain lease agreements contain contingent lease payments. The contingent lease payments are based on various factors, such as, the commercial paper rate plus a credit spread or the consumer price index.
Capital lease rental payments charged to operating expense were $3.3 million in 2004, $3.7 million in 2003 and $1.7 million in 2002. Interest included in capital lease rental payments was $2 million in 2004, $2.3 million in 2003 and $0.6 million in 2002. Operating lease rental payments charged to expense were $16.3 million in 2004, $16.1 million in 2003 and $14.5 million in 2002.
Future minimum rental payments excluding executory costs, such as property taxes, state use taxes, insurance, and maintenance, under long-term noncancelable leases, at December 31, 2004 are as follows:
10.
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt maturities and cash sinking fund requirements on debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, for the years 2005 through 2009 and thereafter, are as follows:
Essentially all utility plant of CL&P, PSNH, NGC, and Yankee Energy System, Inc. is subject to the liens of each company's respective first mortgage bond indenture.
CL&P has $315.3 million of pollution control notes secured by second mortgage liens on transmission assets, junior to the liens of its first mortgage bond indentures.
CL&P has $62 million of tax-exempt Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (PCRBs) with bond insurance and secured by the first mortgage bonds. For financial reporting purposes, this debt is not considered to be first mortgage bonds unless CL&P failed to meet its obligations under the PCRBs.
PSNH entered into financing arrangements with the Business Finance Authority (BFA) of the state of New Hampshire, pursuant to which, the BFA issued five series of PCRBs and loaned the proceeds to PSNH. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $407.3 million of the PCRBs were outstanding. PSNH's obligation to repay each series of PCRBs is secured by bond insurance and the first mortgage bonds. Each such series of first mortgage bonds contains similar terms and provisions as the applicable series of PCRBs. For financial reporting purposes, these first mortgage bonds would not be considered outstanding unless PSNH failed to meet its obligations under the PCRBs.
NU's long-term debt agreements provide that certain of its subsidiaries must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are  customarily included in such agreements, including but not limited to, debt service coverage ratios and interest coverage ratios. The parties to these agreements currently are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants.
Long-term debt  first mortgage bonds at December 31, 2004 includes the issuance of $280 million, $125 million and $50 million of long-term debt related to CL&P, Yankee Gas and PSNH during 2004, respectively.
The weighted-average effective interest rate on the variable-rate pollution control notes ranged from 1.24 percent to 1.26 percent for 2004 and 0.99 percent to 1.08 percent for 2003.
The interest rate of 3.35 percent is effective through October 1, 2008 at which time the bonds will be remarketed, and the interest rate will be adjusted.
Other long-term debt  other at December 31, 2004, includes the issuance of $7.5 million and $50 million of long-term debt related to SESI and WMECO during 2004. In 2004, SESI sold $30 million of receivables related to the energy savings contract projects. The transfer of receivables to the unaffiliated third party qualified as a sale under SFAS No. 140. Accordingly, the $30 million sold at December 31, 2004 is not included as debt in the consolidated financial statements.
For information regarding fees and interest due for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, see Note 1X, "Marketable Securities," and Note 6C, "Commitments and Contingencies - Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs," to the consolidated financial statements.
The fair value of the NU parent 7.25 percent amortizing note, due 2012 in the amount of $263 million is hedged with a fixed to floating interest rate swap. The change in fair value of the debt was recorded as an adjustment to long-term debt with an equal and offsetting adjustment to derivative assets for the change in fair value of the fixed to floating interest rate swap.

Dividend Restrictions
The Federal Power Act, the Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 (the Act), and certain state statutes limit the payment of dividends by CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO to their respective retained earnings balances. Yankee Gas is also subject to the restrictions under the 1935 Act.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries also have dividend restrictions imposed by their long-term debt agreements. These restrictions limit the amount of retained earnings available for NU common dividends. At December 31, 2004, retained earnings available for payment of dividends totaled $343.5 million.
NGC is subject to certain dividend payment restrictions under its bond covenants. The Utility Group credit agreement also limits dividend payments subject to the requirements that each subsidiaries' total debt to total capitalization ratio does not exceed 65 percent.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
The accumulated balance for each other comprehensive income/(loss) item is as follows:
The changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss) are reported net of the following income tax effects:
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) fair value adjustments of NU's qualified cash flow hedging instruments are as follows:

Earnings Per Share
EPS is computed based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, excluding unallocated ESOP shares, during each year. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect if certain securities are converted into common stock. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 696,994 options, 355,153 options and 2,968,933 options, respectively, were excluded from the following table as these options were antidilutive. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted EPS.

Nuclear Generation Asset Divestitures
On November 1, 2002, CL&P and NAEC consummated the sale of their 40.04 percent combined ownership interest in Seabrook to a subsidiary of FPL. CL&P, NAEC and certain other of the joint owners collectively sold 88.2 percent of Seabrook to FPL. NU received approximately $367 million of total cash proceeds from the sale of Seabrook and another approximately $17 million from Baycorp Holdings, Ltd. (Baycorp), as a result of the sale of its interest in Seabrook. A portion of this cash was used to repay all $90 million of NAEC's outstanding debt and other short-term debt, to return a portion of NAEC's equity to NU and was used to pay approximately $93 million in taxes. The remaining proceeds received by NAEC were refunded to PSNH through the Seabrook Power Contracts. As part of the sale, FPL assumed responsibility for decommissioning Seabrook. NAEC and CL&P recorded a gain on the sale in the am ount of approximately $187 million, which was primarily used to offset stranded costs.
Seabrook:
In the third quarter of 2002, CL&P and NAEC received regulatory approvals for the sale of Seabrook from the DPUC and the NHPUC. As a result of these approvals, CL&P and NAEC eliminated $0.6 million and $13.9 million, respectively, on an after-tax basis, of reserves related to their respective ownership shares of certain Seabrook assets.
On October 10, 2000, NU reached an agreement with Baycorp, a 15 percent joint owner of Seabrook, under which NU guaranteed a minimum sale price and NU and Baycorp would share the excess proceeds if the sale of Seabrook resulted in proceeds of more than $87.2 million related to the sale of Baycorp's 15 percent ownership interest. The agreement also limited any accelerated decommissioning funding required to be funded by Baycorp for decommissioning as part of the sale process. NU received approximately $17 million in 2002 in connection with this agreement. This amount is included in the $38.7 million of pre-tax Seabrook-related gains included in other income/(loss).
On July 31, 2002, VYNPC consummated the sale of its nuclear generating plant to a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (Entergy) for approximately $180 million. As part of the sale, Entergy assumed responsibility for decommissioning VYNPC's nuclear generating unit. In 2003, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO sold their collective 17 percent ownership interest in VYNPC. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO will continue to buy approximately 16 percent of the plant's output through March 2012 at a range of fixed prices.
VYNPC:

Segment Information
NU is organized between the Utility Group and NU Enterprises businesses based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each business' products and services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which they operate. Based on different information that is reviewed by NU's new chief operating decision maker on January 1, 2004, separate detailed information regarding the Utility Group's transmission businesses and NU Enterprises' merchant energy business is now included in the following segment information. Segment information for all periods has been restated to conform to the current presentation except for total asset information for the transmission business segment as this information is not available.
The Utility Group segment, including both the regulated electric distribution and transmission businesses, as well as the gas distribution business comprised of Yankee Gas, represents approximately 69 percent, 72 percent, and 78 percent of NU's total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and includes the operations of the regulated electric utilities, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, whose complete financial statements are included in NU's report on Form 10-K. PSNH's distribution segment includes generation activities. Also included in NU's combined report on Form 10-K is detailed information regarding CL&P's, PSNH's, and WMECO's transmission businesses. Utility Group revenues from the sale of electricity and natural gas primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer.
The NU Enterprises merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy, NGC, the generation operations of HWP, and their respective subsidiaries, while the NU Enterprises services and other business segment includes SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, NGS, Woods Network, and their respective subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations. The results of NU Enterprises parent are also included within services and other.
NU's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  For further information regarding these companies, see Note 17, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements.
Select Energy has served a portion of CL&P's transitional standard offer (TSO) or standard offer load for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Total Select Energy revenues from CL&P for CL&P's standard offer load, TSO load and for other transactions with CL&P, represented $611.3 million or 23 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately $688 million or 28 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003, and approximately $631 million or 37 percent for the year ended December 31, 2002, of total NU Enterprises' revenues. Total CL&P purchases from Select Energy are eliminated in consolidation.
WMECO's purchases from Select Energy for standard offer and default service and for other transactions with Select Energy represented approximately $108.5 million, $143 million and $14 million of total NU Enterprises' revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total WMECO purchases from Select Energy are eliminated in consolidation.
Select Energy revenues related to contracts with NSTAR companies represented $300.2 million or 11 percent of total NU Enterprises' revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. Select Energy also provides basic generation service in the New Jersey and Maryland market. Select Energy revenues related to these contracts represented $334.2 million or 12 percent of total NU Enterprises' revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, $380.4 million or 16 percent for the year ended December 31, 2003 and approximately $207.4 million or 12 percent for the year ended December 31, 2002. No other individual customer represented in excess of 10 percent of NU Enterprises' revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, or 2002.
Other in the NU consolidated tables includes the results for Mode 1 Communications, Inc., an investor in NEON, the results of the non-energy-related subsidiaries of Yankee (Yankee Energy Services Company, RMS, Yankee Energy Financial Services, and NorConn Properties, Inc.), the non-energy operations of HWP, the results of NU's parent and service companies, and write-downs of certain of the company's investments. Interest expense included in other primarily relates to the debt of NU parent. Other includes after-tax investment write-downs totaling $8.8 million in 2004 and $11 million in 2002 related to Acumentrics and NEON. No investment write-downs related to Acumentrics or NEON were recorded in 2003. Virtually all of the assets and liabilities of RMS were sold on June 30, 2004.
NU's segment information for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 is as follows (some amounts between segment schedules may
not agree due to rounding):
(1)
Information for segmenting total assets between electric distribution and transmission is not available at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.  On a NU consolidated basis, these distribution and transmission assets are disclosed in the electric distribution columns above.  
NU Enterprises' segment information for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 is as follows.  Eliminations are included in the services and other columns.
16.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
NU concluded that it incorrectly classified as unrestricted cash from counterparties amounts that should have been classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003.  These corrections reclassified unrestricted cash from counterparties to cash and cash equivalents because those funds were unrestricted and were used to fund or were available to fund the company's operations.   The December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet has been restated for these corrections and a correction to decrease derivative assets and liabilities by the same amount in order to eliminate certain intercompany derivative assets and liabilities.  
The effects of the revisions on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2003 are summarized in the following tables (in thousands):
(1)
The 2003 derivative assets and derivative liabilities balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.   See reclassification below.
(2)
Preferred dividends of subsidiaries have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.  Additionally, certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been made to conform with the current year's presentation.  These reclassifications are summarized in the following tables (in thousands):
(1)
The 2003 derivative assets and derivative liabilities balances have been restated from amounts previously reported.  For information regarding these restatements, see Note 16, "Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements," to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)
Other current liabilities as previously reported excludes $46.5 million of counterparty deposits, which are now separately disclosed.
Reclassifications to income statement amounts are as follows:
17.
Subsequent Events
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  As a result, NU's consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 included herein also present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the (loss)/income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income for all prior periods.  Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows.  
Included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are $26.3 million, $5 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, of intercompany revenues that are not eliminated in consolidation due to the separate presentation of discontinued operations.  NU does not expect that after the disposal it will have significant ongoing involvement or continuing cash flows with the entities presented in discontinued operations.
NU's consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of shareholders' equity, and consolidated statements of capitalization were not impacted by this revision.  At September 30, 2005, the assets and liabilities of these companies totaled $136.2 million and $118.4 million, respectively, as those amounts are not significantly different than those reported on the balance sheets included herein.
On November 7, 2005, NU announced, as disclosed in its third quarter 2005 report on Form 10-Q, it would exit the remainder of its merchant energy business segment, which includes the retail marketing business and the competitive generation business.  
 
Consolidated Statements Of Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Item 1.
Financial Statements
The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (All Companies)
A.
Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with this report on Form 10-Q and the Annual Report of Northeast Utilities (NU or the company), The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), which were filed as part of the NU 2004 Form 10-K, and the current reports on Form 8-K disclosed in Part II, Item 6,"Other Information - Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K," included in NU's original report on Form 10-Q.  The condensed consolidated financial statements contain, in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly NU's and the above companies' financial position at March 31, 2005, and the results of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2005 and 2004.  All adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature except those described i n Notes 1B and 2.  The results of operations and statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, are not indicative of the results expected for a full year.  
The condensed consolidated financial statements of NU and of its subsidiaries, as applicable, include the accounts of all their respective subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to present the operations for the following companies as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation:
Select Energy Services, Inc. (SESI) and its wholly owned subsidiaries HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC;
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc.)  (SECI-NH), a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc (SECI);
Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network); and
Woods Electrical Co., Inc. (Woods Electrical).  
For further information regarding these companies, see Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  NU's condensed consolidated balance sheets were not impacted by this revision.
Restructuring and impairment charges which were originally presented in NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income in the first quarter report on Form 10-Q totaling $234.4 million have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of wholesale contract market changes, net separate from restructuring and impairment charges.  These amounts after the reclassification totaled $188.9 million related to wholesale contract market changes, net and $45.5 million related to restructuring and impairment charges, $24 million of which is included in discontinued operations.  For further information regarding this reclassification, see Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes and Restructuring and Impairment Charges," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
B.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."  This statement requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment be recognized as a liability at fair value when incurred and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made.  SFAS No. 143 was effective on January 1, 2003 for NU.  Management has completed its review process for potential asset retirement obligations (ARO) and has not identified any material AROs that have been incurred.  However, management has identified certain removal obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business or have a low probability of occurring.  These types of obligations primarily relate to transmission and distribution lines and poles, telecommuni cation towers, transmission cables, and certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or state regulatory agency re-licensing issues.  These obligations are AROs that have not been incurred or are not material in nature.
Asset Retirement Obligations:
On March 30, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations."  FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of an ARO that is conditional on a future event if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 is effective for NU no later than December 31, 2005.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 47 on NU.
On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payments," (SFAS No. 123R), which amended SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123R requires all companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted to employees.  NU will recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the effective date of SFAS No. 123R, and any new awards after that date.
Share-Based Payments:
On April 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the adoption of a rule that deferred the required effective date of SFAS No 123R until January 1, 2006 for calendar year companies, including NU.  NU is currently determining the amount of compensation expense to be recognized, but management believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.  For further information regarding equity-based compensation, see Note 1F, "Equity-Based Compensation," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
C.
Guarantees
NU provides credit assurance in the form of guarantees and letters of credit (LOCs) in the normal course of business, primarily for the financial performance obligations of NU Enterprises.  NU would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of non-performance by NU Enterprises, primarily Select Energy, Inc. (Select Energy).  At March 31, 2005, the maximum level of exposure in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," under guarantees by NU, primarily on behalf of NU Enterprises, totaled $984 million.  A majority of these guarantees do not have established expiration dates.  Additionally, NU had $106.4 million of LOCs issued, of which $91.4 million were issued for the benefit of NU Enterprises at March 31, 2005.
At March 31, 2005, NU had outstanding guarantees on behalf of the Utility Group and Rocky River Realty (RRR) of $12.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively.  These amounts are included in the total outstanding NU guarantee exposure amount of $984 million.  The remaining guarantee amount of $960.3 million is related to NU Enterprises, of which $265.6 million relates to the energy services business.  The guarantees related to the energy services businesses totaled $92.6 million and were comprised of guarantees of SESI's debt obligations and $173 million related to performance obligations of the energy services businesses.
Several underlying contracts that NU guarantees, as well as certain surety bonds, contain credit ratings triggers that would require NU to post collateral in the event that NU's credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade.
NU currently has authorization from the SEC to provide up to $750 million of guarantees for NU Enterprises through June 30, 2007.  The $12.4 million in guarantees to the Utility Group are subject to a separate $50 million SEC limitation apart from the current $750 million NU Enterprises guarantee limit.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit for NU Enterprises at March 31, 2005 is $516.1 million.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit for the Utility Group at March 31, 2005 is $0.2 million.  These amounts are calculated using different, more probabilistic and fair-value based criteria than the maximum level of exposure required to be disclosed under FIN 45.  FIN 45 includes all exposures even though they are not reasonably likely to result in exposure to NU.
On October 19, 2004, the SEC authorized NU to issue guarantees of up to an aggregate $100 million through June 30, 2007 of the debt or other obligations of two of its subsidiaries, Northeast Utilities Service Company and RRR.  These companies provide certain specialized support and real estate services and occasionally enter into transactions that require financial backing from NU parent.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit under this category at March 31, 2005 is $0.2 million.
D.
Regulatory Accounting
The accounting policies of NU's Utility Group conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
The transmission and distribution businesses of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, along with PSNH's generation business and Yankee Gas Services Company's (Yankee Gas) distribution business, continue to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and management believes that the application of SFAS No. 71 to those businesses continues to be appropriate.  Management also believes that it is probable that NU's Utility Group companies will recover their investments in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets.  In addition, all material net regulatory assets are earning an equity return, except for securitized regulatory assets, which are not supported by equity.
 The components of regulatory assets are as follows:
Regulatory Assets:
Included in WMECO's other regulatory assets are $46.9 million and $50.7 million at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, of amounts related the WMECO's rate cap deferral.  The rate cap deferral allows WMECO to recover stranded costs and these amounts represent the cumulative excess of transition cost revenues over transition cost expenses.
Included in the NU consolidated amounts above at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, are $60.2 million and $87.8 million, respectively, of regulatory assets associated with Yankee Gas' environmental clean-up costs, hardship receivables, and income taxes.
Additionally, the Utility Group had $12.1 million and $11.6 million of regulatory costs at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, that are included in deferred debits and other assets - other on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These amounts represent regulatory costs that have not yet been approved by the applicable regulatory agency.  Management believes these assets are recoverable in future rates.
As discussed in Note 5D, "Commitments and Contingencies - Deferred Contractual Obligations," a substantial portion of the unrecovered contractual obligations regulatory asset has not yet been approved for recovery.  At this time management believes that these regulatory assets are probable of recovery.
 The Utility Group maintained $1.1 billion of regulatory liabilities at both March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  These amounts include revenues subject to refund which are classified as regulatory liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These amounts are comprised of the following:
Regulatory Liabilities:
Included in the NU consolidated amounts above at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, are $108.3 million and $106.5 million, respectively, of regulatory liabilities associated with Yankee Gas' cost of removal, pension, purchased gas adjustment clause and other regulatory liabilities.
E.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
The allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a non-cash item that is included in the cost of Utility Group utility plant and represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction.  The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction in other interest expense and the cost of equity funds is recorded as other income on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income as follows:
The average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula that develops an average rate using the cost of the company's short-term financings as well as the company's capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity).  The average rate is applied to eligible construction work in progress amounts to calculate AFUDC.
F.
Equity-Based Compensation
NU maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and other long-term, equity-based incentive plans under the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan.  NU accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations.  No equity-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share (EPS) if NU had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to equity-based employee compensation:  
Net (loss)/income as reported includes $0.6 million of expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  NU accounts for restricted stock in accordance with APB No. 25 and amortizes the intrinsic value of the award over the related service period.
NU assumes an income tax rate of 40 percent to estimate the tax effect on total equity-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value-based method for all awards.
During the three-month period ended March 31, 2005, no stock options were awarded.
For information regarding new accounting standards issued but not yet effective associated with equity-based compensation, see Note 1B, "New Accounting Standards," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
G.
Sale of Customer Receivables
At March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, CL&P had sold an undivided interest in its accounts receivable of $100 million and $90 million, respectively, to a financial institution with limited recourse through CL&P Receivables Corporation (CRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of CL&P. CRC can sell up to $100 million of an undivided interest in its accounts receivable and unbilled revenues.  At March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the reserve requirements calculated in accordance with the Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement were $23.1 million and $18.8 million, respectively. These reserve amounts are deducted from the amount of receivables eligible for sale at the time.  Concentrations of credit risk to the purchaser under this agreement with respect to the receivables are limited due to CL&P's diverse customer base within its service territory.
At March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, amounts sold to CRC by CL&P but not sold to the financial institution totaling $189.7 million and $139.4 million, respectively, are included in investments in securitizable assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. These amounts would be excluded from CL&P's assets in the event of CL&P's bankruptcy.  On July 7, 2004, CRC renewed its Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement with CL&P and the financial institution through July 6, 2005, and the termination date of the facility was extended to July 3, 2007. CL&P's continuing involvement with the receivables that are sold to CRC and the financial institution is limited to the servicing of those receivables.  
The transfer of receivables to the financial institution under this arrangement qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities - A Replacement of SFAS No. 125."
H.
Other Investments
Yankee Energy System, Inc. (Yankee) maintains a long-term note receivable from BMC Energy LLC (BMC), an operator of renewable energy projects.  In late-March 2004, based on revised information that impacts undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value estimates, management determined that the fair value of the note receivable from BMC had declined and that the note was impaired.  As a result, management recorded an after-tax investment write-down of $1.5 million ($2.5 million on a pre-tax basis) in the first quarter of 2004.  
NU has an investment in the common stock of NEON, a provider of optical networking services.  On March 8, 2005, NEON merged with Globix Corporation (Globix), an unaffiliated publicly-owned entity, and NU received 1.2748 shares of Globix common stock for each of the 2.1 million shares of NEON stock it owned.  In connection with the closing of the merger, a $0.1 million after-tax loss was recognized in the first quarter of 2005.  A pre-tax positive $0.4 million change in fair value subsequent to March 8, 2005 is included in accumulated other comprehensive income.  For further information, see Note 7, "Comprehensive Income," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NU owns 49 percent of the common stock of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC) with a carrying value of $21.7 million at March 31, 2005.  CYAPC is involved in litigation over the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel).  CYAPC filed with the FERC to recover the increased estimate of decommissioning and plant closure costs.  The FERC proceeding is ongoing.  Management believes that this litigation and the FERC proceeding have not impaired the value of its investment in CYAPC at March 31, 2005 but will continue to evaluate the impacts that the litigation and the FERC proceeding have on NU's investment.  For further information regarding the Bechtel litigation, see Note 5D, "Commitments and Contingencies - Deferred Contractual Obligations," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less.  At the end of each reporting period, overdraft amounts are reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to accounts payable.
J.
Special Deposits
Special deposits represents amounts Select Energy has on deposit with unaffiliated counterparties and brokerage firms in the amount of $17.1 million and amounts included in escrow for SESI that have not been spent on construction projects of $15.3 million at March 31, 2005.  Similar amounts totaled $46.3 million and $20 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004.  Special deposits at both March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 also included $16.3 million in escrow for Yankee Gas.  The $16.3 million represents Yankee Gas' June 1, 2005 first mortgage bond payment.
K.
Counterparty Deposits
Balances collected from counterparties resulting from Select Energy's credit management activities totaled $95.6 million at March 31, 2005 and $57.7 million at December 31, 2004.  These amounts are recorded as current liabilities and included as counterparty deposits on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  To the extent Select Energy requires collateral from counterparties, cash is received as a part of the total collateral required.  The right to receive such cash collateral in an unrestricted manner is determined by the terms of Select Energy's agreements.  Key factors affecting the unrestricted status of a portion of this cash collateral include the financial standing of Select Energy and of NU as its credit supporter.
L.
Other Income
The pre-tax components of NU's other income/(loss) items are as follows:
Investment income includes equity in earnings of regional nuclear generating and transmission companies of $0.9 million and $0.1 million of income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Equity in earnings relates to NU's investment in the Yankee Companies and the Hydro-Quebec system.
None of the amounts in either other income - other or other loss - other are individually significant based on applicable accounting rules.
M.
Unbilled Revenues
In the first quarter of 2005, management adopted a new method to estimate unbilled revenues for CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas.  The new method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle.  The billed sales are subtracted from total calendar month sales to estimate unbilled sales.  The impact of adopting the new method was not material.  The new method replaces the requirements method and the cycle method that were used periodically to test the requirements method.

WHOLESALE CONTRACT MARKET CHANGES AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (NU, NU Enterprises)
NU Enterprises recorded $188.9 million of pre-tax wholesale contract market changes for the three months ended March 31, 2005 related to the changes in the fair value of wholesale contracts that the company is in the process of divesting.  These amounts are reported as wholesale contract market changes, net on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.  A summary of those pre-tax charges/(benefits) is as follows (millions of dollars):  
Wholesale Contract Market Changes:
The $294.3 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005, relates to the change in the negative mark-to-market on certain long-term below-market wholesale electricity contracts during the first quarter and to certain contract asset write-offs.  The decision in March 2005 to exit the wholesale marketing business changed management's conclusion regarding the likelihood that these wholesale marketing contracts would result in physical delivery to customers.  This in turn resulted in a change in the first quarter of 2005 from accrual accounting to fair value accounting for the wholesale marketing contracts.  The company is seeking to divest these contracts.
The $105.4 million first quarter 2005 benefit in the above table includes a $94 million pre-tax mark-to-market gain on retail marketing supply contracts which NU Enterprises was seeking to divest.  Originally, retail electric supply was sourced along with the wholesale supply by the wholesale marketing business.  As a result of the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business, these purchase contracts with a positive market value of $94 million at March 31, 2005 were required to be marked-to-market.  This amount also includes $25.8 million of pre-tax mark-to-market gains on other wholesale contracts for other wholesale contracts related to electricity that would have been delivered to customers primarily in 2005 and 2006.  As a result of exiting the wholesale marketing business, these contracts were also required to be marked-to-market.  Prior to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business, it was management's int ention to deliver the electricity to the customer.  As such, accrual accounting was used through December 31, 2004.  Under accrual accounting, earnings would have been recorded as the electricity would have been delivered in 2005 and 2006.  
The $105.4 million first quarter 2005 benefit in the above table was offset by a $14.4 million pre-tax loss associated with a contract termination payment.
Included in the mark-to-market on long-term wholesale electricity contracts is a $54.5 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three months ended March 31, 2005 related to an intercompany contract between Select Energy and CL&P.  The contract extends through 2013 at below current market prices for CL&P.  This contract is part of CL&P's stranded costs, and benefits received by CL&P under this contract are provided to CL&P's ratepayers.  A $2.8 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three months ended March 31, 2005, was recorded as wholesale contract market changes by Select Energy for the intercompany contract between Select Energy and WMECO for default service from April to June of 2005.  WMECO's benefits under this contract will be provided to ratepayers in the form of lower than market default service rates.  These charges were not eliminated in consolidation because on a consolidate d basis NU retains the over-market obligation to the ratepayers of CL&P and WMECO.
For information regarding wholesale current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities that are being divested, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NU Enterprises recorded $45.5 million pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges for the three months ended March 31, 2005 related to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and to divest its energy services businesses.  The amounts related to continuing operations are included as restructuring and impairment charges on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income with the remainder included in discontinued operations.  A summary of those pre-tax charges is as follows (millions of dollars):  
Restructuring and Impairment Charges:  
On March 9, 2005, NU announced that it had completed its comprehensive review of the NU Enterprises businesses.  In the first quarter of 2005, an exclusivity agreement intangible asset totaling $7.2 million related to the merchant energy business was written off.  
NU Enterprises hired an outside firm, FMI Corp., to assist in valuing its energy services businesses and their divestiture.  Based in part on that firm's work, the company concluded that $29.1 million of goodwill associated with those businesses and $9.2 million of intangible assets were impaired as of March 31, 2005.  An impairment charge of $38.3 million was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2005.  
Additional restructuring charges will be recognized as incurred and may include professional fees and employee-related and other costs.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (NU, CL&P, Select Energy, Yankee Gas)
Derivatives that are utilized for trading purposes are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.  Other contracts that are derivatives but do not meet the definition of a cash flow hedge and cannot be designated as being used for normal purchases or normal sales are also recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.  For those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative and meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in the fair value of the effective portion of those contracts are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions occur.  For contracts that meet the definition of a derivative but do not meet the hedging requirements, and for the ineffective portion of contracts that meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in fair value of those contracts are recognized currently in earnings.  Derivative
contracts designated as fair value hedges and the item they are hedging are both recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  Derivative contracts that are entered into as a normal purchase or sale and will result in physical delivery, and are documented as such, are recognized in revenue and expense when such deliveries occur.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2005, a positive $2.4 million, net of tax, was reclassified as revenue from other comprehensive income in connection with the consummation of the underlying hedged transactions and recognized in earnings.  Also during the first quarter of 2005, new cash flow hedge transactions were entered into that hedge cash flows through 2010.  As a result of the consummation of the transactions, these new transactions and market value changes since January 1, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income increased by $7.3 million, net of tax.  Accumulated other comprehensive income at March 31, 2005, was a positive $3.8 million, net of tax (increase to equity), relating to hedged transactions, and it is estimated that a positive $3.7 million included in this net of tax balance will be reclassified as an increase to earnings within the next twelve months.  Cash flows from hedge contracts are reported in the same cate gory as cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction.  
There was a positive pre-tax impact of $0.6 million recognized in earnings in 2005 for the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.  A negative pre-tax $0.1 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 for the ineffective portion of fair value hedges.  The changes in the fair value of both the fair value hedges and the natural gas inventory being hedged are recorded in fuel, purchased, and net interchange power on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.  
The tables below summarize current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004.  The business activities of NU Enterprises that result in the recognition of derivative assets include concentrations of credit risk to energy marketing and trading counterparties.  At March 31, 2005, Select Energy had $485.5 million of derivative assets from trading, non-trading, and hedging activities.  These assets are exposed to counterparty credit risk.  However, a significant portion of these assets is contracted with investment grade rated counterparties or collateralized with cash.  The amounts below do not include option premiums paid, which are recorded as prepayments and amounted to $6.3 million and $5.4 million related to energy trading activities and $0.6 million and $5.2 million related to marketing activities at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  These amounts also do not in clude option premiums paid of $13.6 million and $18.7 million related to non-trading gas options at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  
These amounts also do not include option premiums received, which are recorded as other current liabilities and amounted to $5.5 million and $7 million related to energy trading activities and $0.1 million and $1.1 million related to marketing activities at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  Also not included at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 are option premiums received of $13.8 million and $19 million, respectively, related to non-trading gas options.
 Historically, to gather market intelligence and utilize this information in risk management activities for the wholesale marketing activities, Select Energy conducted limited energy trading activities in electricity, natural gas, and oil, and therefore, experienced net open positions.  Limited trading activities will continue for price discovery and deal execution to support the retail marketing business.  Select Energy manages open trading positions with strict policies that limit its exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures.   
NU Enterprises - Trading:
Derivatives used in trading activities are recorded at fair value and included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets or liabilities.  Changes in fair value are recognized in operating revenues in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income in the period of change.  The net fair value positions of the trading portfolio at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were assets of $47.5 million and $29.6, respectively.  A portion of this increase in the fair value position of the trading portfolio was the result of change in valuation technique used to model a certain contract.  
Select Energy's trading portfolio includes New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures, financial swaps, and options, the fair value of which is based on closing exchange prices; over-the-counter forwards, financial swaps, and options, the fair value of which is based on the mid-point of bid and ask market prices; and bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, the fair value of which is determined using available information from external sources.  Select Energy's trading portfolio also includes transmission congestion contracts (TCC).  The fair value of the TCCs included in the trading portfolio is based on published market data.   
 Certain non-trading derivative contracts are part of Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing activities.  These contracts include the electricity contracts and the wholesale natural gas contracts that were used in Select Energy's energy sourcing activities.  These contracts also include other wholesale and retail short-term and long-term electricity supply and sales contracts, which include contracts to sell electricity to utilities under full requirements contracts and contracts to sell electricity to municipalities over terms up to eight years.  The fair value of the natural gas contracts was determined by prices provided by external sources and actively quoted markets.  The fair value of electricity contracts was determined by prices from external sources for years through 2008 and by models based on natural gas prices and a conversion factor to electricity.  
NU Enterprises - Non-Trading:
The fair value of non-trading contracts, both assets and liabilities combined, decreased by $139.4 million from a negative $78.6 million to a negative $218 million, as follows (in millions):  
 Select Energy utilizes derivative financial and commodity instruments, including futures and forward contracts, to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas purchased to meet firm sales and purchase commitments to certain retail customers.  Select Energy also utilizes derivatives, including price swap agreements, call and put option contracts, and futures and forward contracts to manage the market risk associated with a portion of its anticipated supply and delivery requirements.  These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments and are used to reduce the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity or natural gas.  A derivative that hedges exposure to the variable
NU Enterprises - Hedging:
cash flows of a forecasted transaction (a cash flow hedge) is initially recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Cash flow hedges impact net income when the forecasted transaction being hedged occurs, when hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recorded, when the forecasted transaction being hedged is no longer probable of occurring, or when there is accumulated other comprehensive loss and the hedge and the forecasted transaction being hedged are in a loss position on a combined basis.   
Select Energy maintains natural gas service agreements with certain customers to supply gas at fixed prices for terms extending through 2010.  Select Energy has hedged its gas supply risk under these agreements through NYMEX futures contracts.  Under these contracts, which also extend through 2010, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements.  At March 31, 2005 the NYMEX futures contracts had notional values of $33 million and were recorded at fair value as derivative assets of $10.6 million.   
Select Energy also maintains various physical and financial instruments to hedge its electric and gas purchases and sales through 2006. These instruments include forwards, futures, options, financial collars and swaps.  These hedging contracts, which are valued at the mid-point of bid and ask market prices, were recorded as derivative assets of $2.4 million and derivative liabilities of $6.9 million at March 31, 2005.   
Select Energy hedges certain amounts of natural gas inventory with gas futures, options and swaps, some of which are accounted for as fair value hedges.  Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and natural gas inventory are recorded in earnings.  The fair value of the futures, options and swaps were included in derivative assets and amounted to a negative $0.2 million at March 31, 2005. The fair value of the hedged natural gas inventory was recorded as a reduction to fuel, materials and supplies of $0.1 million at March 31, 2005.  For the three months ended March 31, 2005, Select Energy recorded a positive pre-tax of $0.6 million in earnings related to contracts settled for its hedging instruments and natural gas inventory.  In 2004, certain of these fair value hedges were redesignated as cash flow hedges, and future changes in fair value during the hedge designation will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income (equity), unless ineffective.
 Yankee Gas' non-trading derivatives consist of peaking supply arrangements to serve winter load obligations and firm sales contracts with options to curtail delivery.  These contracts are subject to fair value accounting because these contracts are derivatives that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales, as defined, because of the optionality in the contract terms.  Non-trading derivatives at March 31, 2005 included liabilities of $0.1 million.
Utility Group - Gas - Non-Trading:
 Yankee Gas maintains a master swap agreement with a financial counterparty to purchase gas at fixed prices.  Under this master swap agreement, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas for an unaffiliated customer is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements with that customer for a period not extending beyond 2005.  At March 31, 2005 the commodity swap agreement had a notional value of $1.3 million and was recorded at fair value as a derivative asset of $1.4 million. The firm commitment contract that is hedged is also recorded as a liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair values of the hedge and firm commitment have offsetting impacts in earnings.   
Utility Group - Gas - Hedging:
 CL&P has two independent power producer (IPP) contracts to purchase power that contain pricing provisions that are not clearly and closely related to the price of power and therefore do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception.  The fair values of these IPP non-trading derivatives at March 31, 2005 include a derivative asset with a fair value of $281.3 million and a derivative liability with a fair value of $40.9 million.  An offsetting regulatory liability and an offsetting regulatory asset were recorded, as these contracts are part of the stranded costs, and management believes that these costs will continue to be recovered or refunded in rates.   
Utility Group - Electric - Non-Trading:
 In March of 2003, NU parent entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on its $263 million, 7.25 percent fixed rate note that matures on April 1, 2012.  As a matched-terms fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the swap and the hedged debt instrument are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets but are equal and offsetting in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.  The cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged debt of $6.2 million is included as a decrease to long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The hedge is recorded as a derivative liability of $6.2 million.  The resulting changes in interest payments made are recorded as adjustments to interest expense.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Yankee Gas, NU Enterprises)
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives be reviewed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test.  NU uses October 1st as the annual goodwill impairment testing date.  Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.  
NU's remaining reporting units that maintain goodwill are generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 10, "Segment Information," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Consistent with the way management reviews the operating results of its reporting units, NU's reporting unit under the NU Enterprises reportable segment is the merchant energy reporting unit.  The merchant energy reporting unit is comprised of the operations of Select Energy, Northeast Generation Company (NGC), the generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP), and Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS).  As a result, NU's reporting units that maintain goodwill are as follows:  the Yankee Gas reporting unit, which is classified under the Utility Group - gas reportable segment, and the merchant energy reporting unit, which is classified under th e NU Enterprises - merchant energy reportable segment.  The goodwill balances of these reporting units are included in the table herein.
A summary of NU's goodwill balances at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, by reportable segment and reporting unit is as follows:
On March 9, 2005, NU announced that it had completed its comprehensive review of the NU Enterprises businesses.  During this review, certain goodwill balances and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, and adjustments were recorded in the first quarter of 2005 to write these assets off.  
The goodwill balance in the NU Enterprises energy services reporting unit was determined to be impaired in its entirety, and a $29.1 million write-off was recorded.  Energy services intangible assets not subject to amortization were also impaired, and an $8.5 million write-off was recorded.  An additional $0.7 million of other intangible assets were impaired, and the total write off of $38.3 million is included in restructuring and impairment charges.  
The exclusivity agreement intangible asset, which was included in the merchant energy business, was written off.  The $7.9 million balance of December 31, 2004 was amortized by $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2005.  The remaining $7.2 million was written off and is included in restructuring and impairment charges.  
For information regarding the completion of the comprehensive review and these asset impairments, see Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes and Restructuring and Impairment Charges," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
There were no impairments or adjustments to the goodwill balances during the first quarter of 2004.  
The goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of Yankee Gas is not being recovered from the customers of Yankee Gas.
At March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NU's intangible assets and related accumulated amortization, all of which related to NU Enterprises, consisted of the following:
NU recorded amortization expense of $0.9 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to intangible assets subject to amortization.  Based on the remaining amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated annual amortization expense for 2005 and for each of the succeeding 5 years from 2006 through 2010 is approximately $1 million in 2005 through 2007 and no amortization expense in 2008, 2009 or 2010.  These amounts may vary as acquisitions and dispositions occur in the future.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A.
Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters (CL&P, PSNH, WMECO)
Connecticut:
: The Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and IPP over market costs, while the System Benefits Charge (SBC) allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.   
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2005, CL&P filed its 2004 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which compares CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, total CTA revenues exceeded the CTA revenue requirements by $14.1 million.  This amount was recorded as a regulatory liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  For the same period, SBC revenues exceeded the SBC revenue requirement by $3.6 million.  Management expects a decision in this docket from the DPUC by the end of 2005.  
In the 2001 CTA and SBC reconciliation filing, and subsequently in a September 10, 2002 petition to reopen related proceedings, CL&P requested that a deferred intercompany tax liability associated with the intercompany sale of generation assets be excluded from the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  This liability is currently included as a reduction in the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  On September 10, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision denying CL&P's request, and on October 24, 2003, CL&P appealed the DPUC's final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court.  The appeal has been fully briefed and argued.  A decision from the court is not expected to be issued until the second quarter of 2005 at the earliest.  If CL&P's request is granted and upheld through these court proceedings, there would be additional amounts due to CL&P from its customers.  The amount due is contingent upon the f indings of the court, however, management believes that CL&P's pre-tax earnings would increase by a minimum of $17 million.   
New Hampshire:
The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs.  On an annual basis, PSNH files with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year.  This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues billed with stranded costs, and transition energy service/default energy service (TS/DS) revenues billed with TS/DS costs.  The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of PSNH's generation operations.  The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $224.2 million at March 31, 2005.  This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of non-securitized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $399.1 million to $174.9 million.  
SCRC Reconciliation Filing:
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on May 2, 2005.   Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis.  PSNH has included a request, and supporting testimony, to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process in its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation filing.  This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current
accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting.  At March 31, 2005, the PSNH unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs.  Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
 The New Hampshire legislature is considering a bill that would place strict limitations on the level of mercury that PSNH's existing generation plants can emit.  Management is reviewing possible legislation and how PSNH might meet any required reduction in mercury emissions should such strict limitations be established.  PSNH's alternatives range from the installation of additional pollution control equipment, reducing operating capacity of its plants, non-generation mercury mitigation programs, and possible retirement of one or more of its generating units.  While state law and PSNH's restructuring agreement provide for the recovery of its generation costs, including the cost to comply with state environmental regulations, at this time management is unable to determine the impact of any potential new legislation on PSNH's net income or financial position.  On May 4, 2005, the New Ham pshire legislature voted to retain the bill for further consideration in the 2006 session.
Environmental Legislation:
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2005, WMECO filed its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE).  This filing reconciled the recovery of generation-related stranded costs for calendar year 2004.  The DTE has combined the 2003 transition cost reconciliation filing, standard offer service and default service reconciliation, the transmission cost adjustment filing, and the 2004 transition cost reconciliation filing into a single proceeding.  A hearing schedule for the combined proceeding is expected to be set in May 2005.  While the timing of a decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.
Transition Cost Reconciliation and Other Filings:
B.
NRG Energy, Inc. Exposures (CL&P, Yankee Gas)
Certain subsidiaries of NU, including CL&P and Yankee Gas, entered into transactions with NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) and certain of its subsidiaries.  On May 14, 2003, NRG and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions.  On December 5, 2003, NRG emerged from bankruptcy.  NU's NRG-related exposures as a result of these transactions relate to 1) the recovery of congestion charges incurred by NRG prior to the implementation of standard market design on March 1, 2003, 2) the recovery of CL&P's station service billings from NRG, and 3) the recovery of Yankee Gas' and CL&P's expenditures that were incurred related to an NRG subsidiary's generating plant construction project that has ceased.  While it is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these issues, management does not expect that their resolution will have a material adverse effect on NU's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.< B>
C.
Long-Term Contractual Arrangements (CL&P, Select Energy)
These amounts represent commitments for various services and materials associated with the Bethel, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut and the Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut projects as of March 31, 2005.  For further information regarding these projects, see the "Business Development and Capital Expenditures" section included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this combined report on Form 10-Q.
CL&P:  
Select Energy maintains off-balance sheet long-term agreements to purchase energy as part of its portfolio of resources to meet its actual or expected sales commitments.  These sale commitments are accounted for on the accrual basis.  The aggregate amount of these purchase contracts was $703.2 million at March 31, 2005, as follows (millions of dollars):
Select Energy:  
Select Energy's purchase contract amounts can exceed the amount expected to be reported in fuel, purchased and net interchange power.
D.
Deferred Contractual Obligations (NU, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO)
CYAPC's estimated decommissioning and plant closure costs for the period 2000 through 2023 have increased by approximately $395 million over the April 2000 estimate of $436 million approved by the FERC in a 2000 rate case settlement.  The revised estimate reflects the increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, increased security and liability and property insurance costs, and the fact that CYAPC is now self performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel in July 2003.  NU's share of CYAPC's increase in decommissioning and plant closure costs is approximately $194 million.  On July 1, 2004, CYAPC filed with the FERC for recovery of these increased costs.  In the filing, CYAPC sought to increase its annual decommissioning collections from $16.7 million to $93 million for a six-year period beginning on January 1, 2005.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC issued an order accepting the rates, with collection beginning on February 1, 2005, subject to refund, and scheduled hearings for June 2005.
On June 10, 2004, the DPUC and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed a petition seeking a declaratory order that CYAPC be allowed to recover all decommissioning costs from its wholesale purchasers, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, but that such purchasers may not be allowed to recover in their retail rates any costs that the FERC might determine to have been imprudently incurred.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC denied this petition.  On September 29, 2004, the DPUC and OCC asked the FERC to reconsider the petition.  On October 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order granting further consideration regarding the DPUC's and OCC's petition for reconsideration.  No date has been established for this reconsideration.
Both the DPUC and Bechtel filed testimony in the FERC proceeding claiming that CYAPC was imprudent in its management of the decommissioning project.  The DPUC has claimed that CYAPC did not terminate the contract with Bechtel soon enough, and Bechtel has claimed that CYAPC terminated the contract too soon.  In its testimony, the DPUC recommended a disallowance of $225 million to $234 million out of CYAPC's requested rate increase of approximately $395 million.  NU's share of the DPUC's recommended disallowance is between $110 million to $115 million.  The FERC staff also filed testimony that did not take a position on prudence but recommended a $36 million decrease in the requested rate increase claiming that CYAPC should have used a different gross domestic product (GDP) escalator.  Management expects that if the FERC staff's position on the decommissioning GDP cost escalator is found by the FERC to be more appropriate than that use d by CYAPC to develop its proposed rates, then CYAPC would review whether to reduce its estimated decommissioning obligation and reduce the customers' obligation, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  Hearings in this proceeding are expected to begin in June 2005.  A FERC administrative law judge decision in this proceeding could be rendered in the fall of 2005.
The company cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding required for the collection of the increased CYAPC decommissioning costs.  The company believes that the costs have been prudently incurred and will ultimately be recovered from the customers of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  However, there is a risk that some portion of these increased costs may not be recovered, or will have to be refunded if recovered, as a result of the FERC proceedings.  
 
As mentioned above, CYAPC is currently in litigation with Bechtel in Connecticut Superior Court (the Court) over the termination of its decommissioning contract.  On June 13, 2003, CYAPC gave notice of the termination of its contract with Bechtel for the decommissioning of its nuclear power plant.  CYAPC terminated the contract due to Bechtel's incomplete and untimely performance and refusal to perform the remaining decommissioning work.  Bechtel has departed the site and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process.
On June 23, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC asserting a number of claims and seeking a variety of remedies, including monetary and punitive damages and rescission of the contract.  Bechtel has since amended its complaint to add claims for wrongful termination.  On August 22, 2003, CYAPC filed its answer and counterclaims, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing.  The parties are proceeding with depositions in the case.  Bechtel filed an offer of judgment for CYAPC to pay Bechtel the amount of $20 million, which was rejected by CYAPC.  CYAPC filed an offer of judgment for Bechtel to pay the amount of $65 million to CYAPC, which was rejected by Bechtel.  If either party prevails in litigation with an award equal to or higher than its offer, then the Court will add 12 percent annual interest to the award to the prevailing party, computed fr om the date of the party's claim (from June 23, 2003 for Bechtel or August 22, 2003 for CYAPC).  A trial has been scheduled for spring of 2006.  
In the prejudgment remedy proceeding before the Court, Bechtel sought garnishment of the CYAPC decommissioning trust and related payments.  In October 2004, Bechtel and CYAPC entered into an agreement under which Bechtel waived its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYAPC's real property in Connecticut and the escrowing of $41.7 million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to CYAPC through June 30, 2007 in respect to CYAPC's common equity.  This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be implemented until the Court found
that such assets were subject to attachment.  CYAPC has contested the attachability of such assets.  The DPUC is an intervenor in this proceeding.  NU cannot predict the timing and the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
CYAPC, Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC) (collectively, the Yankee Companies) also commenced litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983 under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act).  Under the Act, the DOE was to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear plants of the Yankee Companies no later than January 31, 1998 in return for payments by each company into the nuclear waste fund.  No fuel has been collected by the DOE, and spent nuclear fuel is stored on the sites of the Yankee Companies' plants.  The Yankee Companies collected the funds for payments into the nuclear waste fund from wholesale utility customers under FERC-approved contract rates.  The wholesale utility customers in turn collect these payments from their retail electric customers.  The Yankee Companies' individual damage claims attributed to the government's breach totaling $548 million are specific to each plant and include incremental storage, security, construction and other costs through 2010.  The CYAPC damage claim is $197 million, the YAEC damage claim is $191 million and the MYAPC damage claim is $160 million.
The DOE trial ended on August 31, 2004 and a verdict has not been reached.  The current Yankee Companies' rates do not include an amount for recovery of damages in this matter.  Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
E.
Consolidated Edison, Inc. Merger Litigation
Certain gain and loss contingencies continue to exist with regard to the 1999 merger agreement between NU and Consolidated Edison, Inc. and the related litigation.  At this stage of the litigation, management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate effect on NU.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (NU)
EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect if certain securities are converted into common stock.  At March 31, 2005 and 2004, 1,507,145 options and 655,326 options, respectively, were excluded from the following table as these options were antidilutive.  The following table sets forth the components of basic and fully diluted EPS:
9.
PENSION BENEFITS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (All Companies)
NU's subsidiaries participate in a uniform noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Pension Plan) covering the majority of regular NU employees and also provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits through a benefit plan to retired employees (PBOP Plan).  The components of net periodic benefit expense for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 are estimated as follows:
A portion of this net periodic expense is capitalized related to current employees working on capital projects.  Amounts capitalized were $2.3 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  
NU does not expect to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2005.  NU contributed and anticipates contributing approximately $12.6 million quarterly totaling approximately $50 million in 2005 to fund its PBOP Plan.  
10.
SEGMENT INFORMATION (All Companies)
NU is organized between the Utility Group and NU Enterprises businesses based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each business' products and services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which they operate.  Effective January 1, 2005, the portion of NGS' business that supports NGC's and HWP's generation assets has been reclassified from the services and other segment to the merchant energy segment within the NU Enterprises segment.  Segment information for all periods presented has been restated to conform to the current presentation.  
The Utility Group segment, including both the regulated electric distribution and transmission businesses, as well as the gas distribution business comprised of Yankee Gas, represents approximately 62 percent and 69 percent of NU's total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and includes the operations of the regulated electric utilities, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, whose complete condensed consolidated financial statements are included in NU's original combined report on Form 10-Q.  PSNH's distribution segment includes generation activities.  Also included in this combined report on Form 10-Q is detailed information regarding CL&P's, PSNH's, and WMECO's transmission businesses.  Utility Group revenues from the sale of electricity and natural gas primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer.
The NU Enterprises merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy, NGC, the generation operations of HWP and NGS, while the NU Enterprises services and other business segment includes E. S. Boulos Company, Woods Electrical and NGS Mechanical, Inc., which are subsidiaries of NGS, SECI, Reeds Ferry Supply Co. Inc., HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc., and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC, which are subsidiaries of SESI, Woods Network, and intercompany eliminations.  The results of NU Enterprises parent are also included within services and other.
NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  For further information regarding these companies, see Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
There were no CL&P transitional standard offer (TSO) purchases from Select Energy in the first quarter of 2005.  Total Select Energy revenues from CL&P for other transactions with CL&P, represented $14.2 million or 2 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2005, of total NU Enterprises' revenues.  Effective January 1, 2004, Select Energy began serving a portion of CL&P's TSO load for 2004.  Total Select Energy revenues from CL&P for CL&P's TSO load and for other transactions with CL&P, represented $178.5 million or 24 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2004, of total NU Enterprises' revenues.  Total CL&P purchases from Select Energy are eliminated in consolidation.
WMECO's purchases from Select Energy for standard offer and default service and for other transactions with Select Energy represented $20.5 million and $32 million, or 2 percent and 4 percent, of total NU Enterprises' revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Total WMECO purchases from Select Energy are eliminated in consolidation.  
Select Energy revenues related to contracts with NSTAR companies represented $206.4 million or 24 percent and $88.7 million or 12 percent of total NU Enterprises' revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

RESTATEMENT AND RECLASSIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NU, Select Energy)
NU concluded that it incorrectly classified as unrestricted cash from counterparties amounts that should have been classified as cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004.  Corrections were made to reclassify unrestricted cash from counterparties to cash and cash equivalents because those funds were unrestricted and were used to fund or were available to fund the company's operations.  The condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2004, has been restated for these corrections.  
The effects of the corrections and other reclassifications to conform with the current period presentation on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):
(1)
These amounts relate to the restatement of the balances in unrestricted cash from counterparties and cash and cash equivalents.  
Certain other reclassifications of prior period data included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, primarily related to fuel, purchased and net interchange power, and other operation and maintenance expenses totaling $15.4 million on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income have been made to conform with the current period presentation.  The condensed consolidated statement of cash flows has also been reclassified to exclude from cash flows from operations the change in accounts payable related to capital projects.  This accounts payable reclassification was also made for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.
12.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  As a result, NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included in this report on Form 10-Q also present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the loss from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for all prior periods.  Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows.  
Included in discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 are $3.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of intercompany revenues that are not eliminated in consolidation due to the separate presentation of discontinued operations.  NU does not expect that after the disposal it will have significant ongoing involvement or continuing cash flows with the entities presented in discontinued operations.
NU's condensed consolidated balance sheets were not impacted by this revision.  At September 30, 2005, the assets and liabilities of these companies totaled $136.2 million and $118.4 million, respectively, as those amounts are not significantly different than those reported on the balance sheets included herein.
On November 7, 2005, NU announced, as disclosed in its third quarter 2005 report on Form 10-Q, it would exit the remainder of its merchant energy business segment, which includes the retail marketing business and the competitive generation business.  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Northeast Utilities
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Northeast Utilities and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of March 31, 2005, and the related condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2005 and 2004.  These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2, the Company's competitive business subsidiary, NU Enterprises, Inc., recorded significant restructuring and impairment charges in the quarter ended March 31, 2005 in connection with its decision to exit certain businesses.  
As discussed in Notes 1A and 12, the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to reflect certain components of the Company's energy services businesses as discontinued operations.
We have previously audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of capitalization of Northeast Utilities and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 16, 2005 (November 22, 2005 as to Notes 1B, 1H, 1V, 13, 15 and 17), we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
 
As discussed in Note 11, the Company has restated the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2004.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes in this Form 10-Q, the NU 2004 Form 10-K, and the current reports on Form 8-K disclosed in Part II, Item 6, "Other Information - Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K," included in NU's original report on Form 10-Q.  All per share amounts are reported on a fully diluted basis.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
The following items in this executive summary are explained in this report on Form 10-Q:
Strategy, Results and Outlook:
In March 2005, Northeast Utilities (NU or the company) concluded its review of its competitive energy businesses.  NU decided that it would exit the wholesale marketing business and divest its energy services businesses.  NU decided to retain its competitive retail energy marketing business and its 1,443 megawatts (MW) of competitive generation assets.
NU reported consolidated losses of $117.7 million, or $0.91 per share in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $67.4 million, or $0.53 per share, in the same period of 2004.
NU Enterprises lost $167.4 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2004.  The 2005 losses were due primarily to charges related to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses.  First quarter 2005 NU Enterprises results also were affected by a $25.7 million after-tax negative movement in the value of certain natural gas contracts signed in 2004 to hedge Select Energy, Inc.'s (Select Energy) wholesale electricity positions.  These positions were balanced in the first quarter of 2005 and will have no impact on future earnings.
The Utility Group earned $53.6 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2004.
NU projects regulated company earnings of between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005 and parent and other costs of between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005.  The regulated earnings range reflects between $0.96 per share and $1.00 per share at the regulated distribution and generation businesses and between $0.26 per share and $0.30 per share at the regulated transmission business.  The company is not providing 2005 earnings guidance for its NU Enterprises businesses.
The decision to exit the wholesale marketing business has and is expected to continue to reduce the risk profile of NU Enterprises in 2005.  Until exiting the wholesale marketing business, however, NU Enterprises will continue to be exposed to certain market risks for existing contracts until they expire or are divested.  
Regulatory Items:
On April 7, 2005, the Connecticut Siting Council (CSC) approved construction of a 69-mile 345 kilovolt (kV) transmission project that The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) has proposed to build with United Illuminating (UI) between Middletown and Norwalk, Connecticut.  CL&P would own 80 percent of the project, which is expected to cost between $840 million and $990 million.
On April 4, 2005, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission's (NHPUC) approval of Public Service Company of New Hampshire's (PSNH) Northern Wood Power Project, which involves converting one of PSNH's three existing 50 megawatt coal-burning units at Schiller Station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to burn wood chips.  The court rejected claims from competing wood-fired generating plants that PSNH's project was not in the public interest.
The NHPUC will hold hearings on the allowed return on equity (ROE) on PSNH's generation investments.  Any changes would apply prospectively, as the NHPUC deems appropriate.  PSNH currently earns an 11 percent ROE on its generation investments.  The NHPUC has scheduled hearings in this docket and a decision is expected in June 2005.  
Liquidity:
CL&P sold $200 million of first mortgage bonds in April 2005.  Proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings.
Cash flows from operations decreased by $138.8 million to $188.5 million for the first quarter of 2005 from $327.3 million for the first quarter of 2004.  
Overview
NU lost $117.7 million, or $0.91 per share, in the first quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $67.4 million, or $0.53 per share, in the first quarter of 2004.  A summary of NU's earnings/(losses) by major business line for the first quarters of 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
Consolidated:  
(1)
The NU Enterprises losses include losses totaling $17.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.
The 2005 NU losses were due to the company's decision for NU Enterprises to exit the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses.  In the first quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises recorded an after-tax mark-to-market charge of $120.1 million ($188.9 million pre-tax) associated with certain wholesale electric contracts it is seeking to divest and $29.9 million of after-tax ($45.5 million pre-tax) restructuring and impairment charges.
Those charges exclude a negative after-tax mark-to-market charge of $25.7 million on certain wholesale natural gas contracts signed in 2004 to hedge Select Energy's wholesale electricity contracts for 2005 and 2006 that were used in Select Energy's energy sourcing activities.  These positions were balanced out in the first quarter of 2005 and will have no impact on future earnings.
Excluding the restructuring charges and mark-to-market charge on natural gas contracts noted above, NU Enterprises earned $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2004.  NU Enterprises' earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were favorably impacted by the net increase in the mark-to-market of one wholesale energy trading contract of $9.2 million after-tax, offset by after-tax losses on construction
contracts at NU Enterprises' energy services businesses totaling $3.1 million.  In 2004, NU Enterprises' wholesale margins were much stronger in the first quarter of 2004 than in the other quarters of the year due to contract pricing terms.  
For information regarding these charges, see Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes and Restructuring and Impairment Charges," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 present the operations for the following companies as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation:
Select Energy Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (SESI) HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC;
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc. (Reeds Ferry)) (SECI-NH), a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc. (SECI);
Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network); and
Woods Electrical Co., Inc. (Woods Electrical).  
For further information regarding these companies, see Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  NU's condensed consolidated balance sheets were not impacted by this revision.
The Utility Group is comprised of CL&P, PSNH, Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), and Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), including their transmission, distribution and generation businesses.  After payment of preferred dividends, earnings at the Utility Group increased by $0.2 million to $53.6 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared with $53.4 million in 2004.  Utility Group earnings were virtually the same in 2005 as compared with 2004 as retail rate increases were offset by lower sales and higher pension, depreciation, and interest expense.  A summary of Utility Group earnings by company for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
Utility Group:
*After preferred dividends.
CL&P's first quarter 2005 results were slightly lower due to lower kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales, which decreased 0.6 percent compared with the same period of 2004, primarily in the industrial sales class, as well as higher depreciation, interest, and pension expense.  Those cost increases and sales declines were offset by a $25 million annualized distribution rate increase that took effect on January 1, 2005 and higher transmission earnings.
PSNH earnings decreased due to higher operating costs, including depreciation, operation and other expenses.  PSNH's retail sales decreased 2.7 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with the same period of 2004, primarily due to an 11.5 percent decrease in industrial sales.  The decrease in industrial retail sales is primarily the result of the loss of three large industrial customers.  
WMECO earnings increased due primarily to a $6 million annualized distribution rate increase that took effect on January 1, 2005 which more than offset higher interest and pension expense.  WMECO's retail sales rose 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with the same period of 2004.
Yankee Gas earnings rose due to a $14 million annualized rate increase that took effect on January 1, 2005 that more than offset higher operating costs.  Yankee Gas's firm natural gas retail sales decreased 2.3 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with the first quarter of 2004.  
Included in Utility Group earnings are earnings related to the transmission business.  Transmission business earnings were $8.8 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2004.  The increase was driven primarily by higher transmission rates related to a larger transmission rate base.
NU Enterprises is the parent of Northeast Generation Company (NGC), Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS), Select Energy, SESI and their respective subsidiaries and Woods Network, all of which are collectively referred to as "NU Enterprises."  The generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) are also included in the results of NU Enterprises.  The companies included in the NU Enterprises segment are grouped into two business segments:  the merchant energy segment and the energy services segment.  Included in the merchant energy business segment is Select Energy's wholesale marketing business, which NU Enterprises will be exiting.  The merchant energy segment will include 1,296 MW of primarily pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets owned by NGC, 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets owned by HWP, Select Energy's retail business on a going forward basis a nd NGS.  The energy services

Boulos Company, Woods Electrical, and NGS Mechanical, Inc., which are subsidiaries of NGS, SECI, Reeds Ferry, HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc., and HEC/CJTS Energy Center, LLC, which are subsidiaries of SESI and Woods Network.  The businesses will be divested in a manner that maximizes their values.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.
NU Enterprises lost $167.4 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2004.  A summary of NU Enterprises' (losses)/earnings by business for the first quarter of 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
(1)
The energy services, parent and other losses include losses totaling $17.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.
In the first quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises recorded an after-tax mark-to-market charge of $120.1 million ($188.9 million pre-tax) associated with certain wholesale electric contracts it is seeking to divest.  NU Enterprises is seeking to divest those contracts and will continue to mark them to market until they are divested or expire.  If wholesale electric prices continue to fluctuate, those price movements will have an impact on NU Enterprises' earnings.  This charge consists of the following components:
An after-tax loss of $164.2 million ($257.7 million pre-tax) associated with the mark-to-market on certain long-term below market wholesale electricity contracts.  The decision in March 2005 to exit the wholesale marketing business changed management's conclusion regarding the likelihood that these wholesale marketing contracts would result in physical delivery to customers.  This in turn resulted in a change in the first quarter of 2005 from accrual accounting to fair value accounting for the wholesale marketing contracts;
After-tax mark-to-market contract asset write-offs of $23.3 million ($36.6 million pre-tax) directly relating to the long-term wholesale electricity contracts;
After-tax mark-to-market gains of $59.9 million ($94 million pre-tax) on retail marketing supply contracts associated with marking-to-market certain wholesale electricity positions that were obtained to support Select Energy's retail marketing contracts.  Originally, retail electric supply was sourced along with the wholesale supply by the wholesale marketing business.  As a result of the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business, these purchase contracts were required to be marked-to-market;
After-tax mark-to-market gains of $16.5 million ($25.8 million pre-tax) were recorded for other wholesale contracts related to electricity that would have been delivered to customers primarily in 2005 and 2006.  As a result of exiting the wholesale marketing business, these contracts were also required to be marked-to-market.  Prior to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business, it was management's intention to deliver the electricity to the customer.  As such, accrual accounting was used through December 31, 2004.  Under accrual accounting, earnings would have been recorded as the electricity would have been delivered in 2005 and 2006;
An after-tax loss of $9 million ($14.4 million pre-tax) associated with a contract termination payment.
Also in the first quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises recorded an after-tax loss of $29.9 million ($45.5 million pre-tax) relating to restructuring and impairment charges.  In March 2005, NU Enterprises hired an outside firm, FMI Corp., to assist in valuing its energy services businesses and assist in their divestiture.  Based in part on that firm's work, the company concluded that $19.2 million after-tax ($29.1 million pre-tax) of goodwill associated with those businesses and $6.1 million after-tax ($9.2 million pre-tax) of intangible assets were impaired.  An after-tax impairment charge of $25.3 million ($38.3 million pre-tax) was recorded.  In addition, an exclusivity agreement intangible asset totaling $4.6 million after-tax  ($7.2 million pre-tax) related to the merchant energy business was determined to be impaired and was written off.  NU Enterprises has initiated the process of divesting those businesses and intends to compl ete that process by the end of 2005.  NU Enterprises may record additional charges as the divestiture is completed.
A portion of these impairment charges totaling $14.6 million after-tax ($24 million pre-tax) is included in loss from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income as the charges relate to service companies that are presented as discontinued operations.  
Aside from the restructuring charges and the marking-to-market of the wholesale natural gas positions, NU Enterprises earned $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2004.  First quarter 2005 earnings were favorably impacted by the net increase in the mark-to-market of one wholesale energy trading contract of $9.2 million after-tax.  
Aside from the impairments, the energy services, parent and other businesses lost $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared with losses of $0.3 million in the same period of 2004.  The weaker performance was due to reserves taken against certain construction contracts.
Parent company and other expenses totaled $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $4.8 million in the same quarter of 2004.  Results in 2005 were negatively affected by a $2.2 million charge associated with higher manufactured gas plant environmental liabilities at HWP's Mt. Tom coal-fired unit.  First quarter 2004 results reflected a write-down of approximately $1.5 million associated with a note receivable from an operator of renewable energy projects.
Parent and Other:  
Future Outlook
The Utility Group continues to estimate that it will earn between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005.  That range reflects earnings of between $0.96 per share and $1.00 per share in the regulated distribution and generation businesses and between $0.26 per share and $0.30 per share at the transmission business.
Utility Group:
 The earnings of NU Enterprises have and will continue to be impacted by many factors, including potential further asset impairments or losses on disposals that could result from the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses, changes in market prices which currently impact earnings because of the application of mark-to-market accounting to certain wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are sold or until the commodities are delivered, and other closure costs. Accordingly, NU is not providing NU Enterprises 2005 earnings guidance.
NU Enterprises:
Parent and other costs, primarily related to interest expense, continue to be estimated to total between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005.
Parent and Other:
Liquidity
NU continues to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.  At March 31, 2005, NU had $74 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $47 million at December 31, 2004.  
Consolidated:  
Cash flows from operations decreased by $138.8 million from $327.3 million for the first three months of 2004 to $188.5 million for the first three months of 2005.  The decrease in operating cash flows is due to higher regulatory refunds, primarily due to lower Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) and Generation Service Charge (GSC) collections as CL&P refunds amounts to its ratepayers for past overcollections or uses those amounts to recover current costs.  The decrease in operating cash flows is also due to changes in working capital items, primarily receivables and unbilled revenues, investments in securitizable assets and accounts payable.  Receivables and unbilled revenues, increased in part due to CL&P rate increases in the first quarter of 2005 for transitional standard offer (TSO) and Federally Mandated Congestion Costs (FMCC) charges, higher Yankee Gas receivables as a result of the seasonality of that business and higher r eceivable levels at NU Enterprises due to an increased number of customers and level of sales and increased gas volumes and sales.  Investments in securitizable assets are receivables and unbilled revenues which are eligible to be but have not been sold to the financial institution under CL&P's receivables sales arrangement.  These decreases are offset by a decrease in amounts that Select Energy has on deposit with unaffiliated counterparties and brokerage firms.
On March 31, 2005, NU paid a dividend of $0.1625 per share.  On April 12, 2005, the NU Board of Trustees approved a common dividend of $0.1625 per share, payable June 30, 2005, to shareholders of record at June 1, 2005.
NU's capital expenditures totaled $166.8 million in the first three months of 2005, compared with $148.6 million in the first three months of 2004.  The higher level of spending reflects increased investment at the Utility Group.  NU projects capital expenditures to total $740 million in 2005.  
On January 14, 2005, Fitch Ratings removed NU from watch-negative and affirmed NU and CL&P credit ratings with a negative outlook.  On February 16, 2005, Moody's Investors Service downgraded by one notch the securities of NU, CL&P and NGC.  The securities of WMECO were downgraded two notches and the ratings of PSNH securities were affirmed.  All NU securities were placed on a stable outlook by Moody's.
At March 31, 2005, the Utility Group had $152 million of borrowings on its $400 million revolving credit line.  Additionally, CL&P has an arrangement with a financial institution under which CL&P can sell up to $100 million of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues.  At March 31, 2005, CL&P had sold $100 million to that financial institution.
Utility Group:  
On April 7, 2005, CL&P closed on the sale of $100 million of 10-year first mortgage bonds carrying a coupon rate of 5.0 percent and $100 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds carrying a coupon rate of 5.625 percent.  Proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings.
PSNH and Yankee Gas are expected to issue $50 million of first mortgage bonds later in 2005 and WMECO is expected to issue $50 million of senior unsecured notes.  In the second quarter of 2005, Yankee Gas received approval from the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) regarding its issuance.  The application for the WMECO issuance is pending before the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE).
At March 31, 2005, NU Enterprises had $91.4 million of letters of credit (LOCs) and $115 million of cash borrowings outstanding on NU parent's $500 million revolving credit line.  During the first quarter of 2005, Select Energy also posted approximately $13 million in new deposits with unaffiliated counterparties and brokerage firms related to the mark-to-market on its natural gas contracts that were used in Select Energy's energy sourcing activities.  
NU Enterprises:  
Although the charges recorded in the first quarter of 2005 were primarily non-cash in nature, NU Enterprises' exiting the wholesale marketing business and divesting of the energy services businesses could have an impact on NU Enterprises' liquidity requirements.  Most of the working capital and LOCs required by NU Enterprises are currently used to support the wholesale marketing business.  As NU Enterprises' wholesale contracts expire or are divested, its liquidity requirements also are expected to decline.  Currently, NU Enterprises' liquidity is impacted by both the amount of collateral from other counterparties it receives and the amount of collateral it is required to deposit with counterparties.  The sale or renegotiation of the longer-term below market electricity contracts, however, may require NU Enterprises to make upfront payments to the counterparties in such transactions.
Nuclear Decommissioning and Plant Closure Costs
Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company's (CYAPC) estimated decommissioning and plant closure costs for the period 2000 through 2023 have increased by approximately $395 million over the April 2000 estimate of $436 million approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a 2000 rate case settlement.  The revised estimate reflects the increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, increased security and liability and property insurance costs, and the fact that CYAPC is now self performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel) in July 2003.  NU's share of CYAPC's increase in decommissioning and plant closure costs is approximately $194 million.  On July 1, 2004, CYAPC filed with the FERC for recovery of these increased costs.  In the filing, CYAPC sought to increase its annual decommissioning collections fro m $16.7 million to $93 million for a six-year period beginning on January 1, 2005.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC issued an order accepting the rates, with collection beginning on February 1, 2005, subject to refund, and scheduled hearings for June 2005.
On June 10, 2004, the DPUC and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed a petition seeking a declaratory order that CYAPC be allowed to recover all decommissioning costs from its wholesale purchasers, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, but that such purchasers may not be allowed to recover in their retail rates any costs that the FERC might determine to have been imprudently incurred.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC denied this petition.  On September 29, 2004, the DPUC and OCC asked the FERC to reconsider the petition.  On October 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order granting further consideration regarding the DPUC's and OCC's petition for reconsideration.  No date has been established for this reconsideration.
Both the DPUC and Bechtel filed testimony in the FERC proceeding claiming that CYAPC was imprudent in its management of the decommissioning project.  The DPUC has claimed that CYAPC did not terminate the contract with Bechtel soon enough, and Bechtel has claimed that CYAPC terminated the contract too soon.  In its testimony, the DPUC recommended a disallowance of $225 million to $234 million out of CYAPC's requested rate increase of approximately $395 million.  NU's share of the DPUC's recommended disallowance is between $110 million to $115 million.  The FERC staff also filed testimony that did not take a position on prudence but recommended a $36 million decrease in the requested rate increase claiming that CYAPC should have used a different gross domestic product (GDP) escalator.  Management expects that if the FERC staff's position on the decommissioning GDP cost escalator is found by the FERC to be more appropriate than that use d by CYAPC to develop its proposed rates, then CYAPC would review whether to reduce its estimated decommissioning obligation and reduce the customers' obligation, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  Hearings in this proceeding are expected to begin in June 2005.  A FERC administrative law judge decision in this proceeding could be rendered in the fall of 2005.
The company cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding required for the collection of the increased CYAPC decommissioning costs.  The company believes that the costs have been prudently incurred and will ultimately be recovered from the customers of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  However, there is a risk that some portion of these increased costs may not be recovered, or will have to be refunded if recovered, as a result of the FERC proceedings.
 
As mentioned above, CYAPC is currently in litigation with Bechtel in Connecticut Superior Court (the Court) over the termination of its decommissioning contract.  On June 13, 2003, CYAPC gave notice of the termination of its contract with Bechtel for the decommissioning of its nuclear power plant.  CYAPC terminated the contract due to Bechtel's incomplete and untimely performance
and refusal to perform the remaining decommissioning work.  Bechtel has departed the site and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process.
On June 23, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC asserting a number of claims and seeking a variety of remedies, including monetary and punitive damages and rescission of the contract.  Bechtel has since amended its complaint to add claims for wrongful termination.  On August 22, 2003, CYAPC filed its answer and counterclaims, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing.  The parties are proceeding with depositions in the case.  Bechtel filed an offer of judgment for CYAPC to pay Bechtel the amount of $20 million, which was rejected by CYAPC.  CYAPC filed an offer of judgment for Bechtel to pay the amount of $65 million to CYAPC, which was rejected by Bechtel.  If either party prevails in litigation with an award equal to or higher than its offer, then the Court will add 12 percent annual interest to the award to the prevailing party, computed fr om the date of the party's claim (from June 23, 2003 for Bechtel or August 22, 2003 for CYAPC).  A trial has been scheduled for spring of 2006.  
In the prejudgment remedy proceeding before the Court, Bechtel sought garnishment of the CYAPC decommissioning trust and related payments.  In October 2004, Bechtel and CYAPC entered into an agreement under which Bechtel waived its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYAPC's real property in Connecticut and the escrowing of $41.7 million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to CYAPC through June 30, 2007 in respect to CYAPC's common equity.  This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be implemented until the Court found that such assets were subject to attachment.  CYAPC has contested the attachability of such assets.  The DPUC is an intervenor in this proceeding.  NU cannot predict the timing and the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
CYAPC, Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC) (collectively, the Yankee Companies) also commenced litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983 under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act).  Under the Act, the DOE was to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear plants of the Yankee Companies no later than January 31, 1998 in return for payments by each company into the nuclear waste fund.  No fuel has been collected by the DOE, and spent nuclear fuel is stored on the sites of the Yankee Companies' plants.  The Yankee Companies collected the funds for payments into the nuclear waste fund from wholesale utility customers under FERC-approved contract rates.  The wholesale utility customers in turn collect these payments from their retail electric customers.  The Yankee Companies' individual damage claims attributed to the government's breach totaling $548 million are specific to each plant and include incremental storage, security, construction and other costs through 2010.  The CYAPC damage claim is $197 million, the YAEC damage claim is $191 million and the MYAPC damage claim is $160 million.
The DOE trial ended on August 31, 2004 and a verdict has not been reached.  The current Yankee Companies' rates do not include an amount for recovery of damages in this matter.  Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
Business Development and Capital Expenditures
Utility Group:
On April 7, 2005, the CSC approved a proposal by CL&P and UI to build a 69-mile 345 kV transmission line from Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut.  The project is expected to cost between $840 million and $990 million with CL&P owning 80 percent of the project.  Approximately 24 miles of the 345 kV line will be built underground with the balance being built overhead.  Towns along the overhead section opposed the project and an appeal of the CSC's project approval to the Connecticut Superior Court is possible.  The project still requires CSC review of detailed construction plans, as well as United States Army Corps of Engineers approval to bury the line beneath certain navigable rivers.  CL&P expects the project to be completed by the end of 2009.  At March 31, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $21 million associated with this project.
Connecticut  CL&P:  
In March 2005, CL&P signed contracts for construction of a 345 kV line between Bethel, Connecticut and Norwalk, Connecticut.  Line construction activities began in April 2005, although a considerable amount of substation work had been completed earlier.  CL&P expects to complete the project by the end of 2006 at a cost of between $300 million and $350 million.  At March 31, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $77 million associated with this project.
On May 3, 2005, hearings resumed at the CSC on CL&P's construction of two 115 kV underground transmission lines between Norwalk, Connecticut and Stamford, Connecticut.  The project is expected to cost approximately $120 million and meet growing electric demands in the area.  Management expects the lines to be in service during 2008.  At March 31, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $4 million related to this project.
On October 1, 2004, CL&P and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) jointly filed plans with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to replace an undersea 13-mile electric transmission line between Norwalk, Connecticut and Northport -
Long Island, New York, consistent with a comprehensive settlement agreement reached on June 24, 2004.  This project is estimated to cost in the range of $114 million to $135 million with CL&P and LIPA each owning approximately 50 percent of the line.  The cost range reflects that vendor contracts have not yet been signed.  The project has received CSC approval, and federal and New York state approvals are expected in 2005.  Assuming final approval is received in 2005, construction activities are scheduled to begin in the fall of 2006 and management expects the line will be in service by 2007.  At March 31, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $7 million of costs related to this project.
Proposed legislation in the current session of the Connecticut General Assembly would provide for new demand-side and supply-side initiatives to address anticipated rising capacity costs caused by changes in the wholesale electricity market rules.  The draft bill contemplates promotion of distributed generation to help meet the state's generation shortfall.  The draft bill also would require utilities to enter into long-term electricity contracts with generators under a request for proposal process administered by the DPUC.  The draft bill is expected to undergo revisions over the next month with a potential vote occurring prior to the end of the session in early June 2005.  
In January 2005, Yankee Gas held formal groundbreaking for a 1.2 billion cubic foot liquefied natural gas storage facility in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Construction of the facility began in March and is expected to be completed in 2007 in time for the 2007-2008 heating season.  The facility is expected to cost $108 million and through March 31, 2005, Yankee Gas has capitalized $17.5 million related to this project.
Connecticut  Yankee Gas:  
On April 4, 2005, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed an appeal of the NHPUC's approval of PSNH's conversion of a 50 megawatt coal-burning unit at Schiller Station to burn wood chips.  The appeal was filed by the owners of other New Hampshire wood-burning generating units.  Construction activities associated with the $75 million project began in late 2004 and are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006.  At March 31, 2005, PSNH has capitalized $29 million related to this project.
New Hampshire:  
As part of the project, a conveyor must be constructed over a single railroad track owned by Boston & Maine Corporation (B&M).  B&M has denied PSNH permission to construct this crossing.  On April 12, 2005, B&M filed a request for a declaratory ruling and injunctive relief with the Rockingham County (New Hampshire) Superior Court, asking the court to rule that PSNH had no legal entitlement to such a crossing.  On April 20, 2005, PSNH filed a petition for condemnation against B&M and certain of its affiliates at the NHPUC.  Failure to receive authority in a timely manner to build the conveyor over the railroad track could delay the construction and operation of the project.
In March 2005, HWP notified Massachusetts environmental regulators that it planned to install a selective catalytic reduction system at the 147 megawatt Mt. Tom coal-fired station in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The system will significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from the unit and extend its operating life.  The $14 million project is expected to be complete by mid-2006.  At March 31, 2005, HWP has capitalized $0.4 million related to this project.
NU Enterprises:  
Transmission Access and FERC Regulatory Charges
In January 2005, the New England transmission owners approved activation of the New England Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) which occurred on February 1, 2005.  CL&P, WMECO and PSNH are now members of the New England RTO and provide regional open access transmission service over their combined transmission system under the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, FERC Electric Tariff No. 3 and local open access transmission service under the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, FERC Electric No. 3, Schedule 21 - NU.
In June 2004, the transmission business reached a settlement with the parties to its rate case, allowing NU to implement a formula-based LNS tariff with an allowed ROE of 11.0 percent.  This settlement was approved by the FERC in September, 2004.  As a result of the RTO start-up on February 1, 2005, the ROE in the LNS tariff was increased to 12.8 percent.  The ROE being utilized in the calculation of the current RNS rates is the sum of the 12.8 percent "base" ROE, plus a 50 basis point incentive adder for joining the RTO, or a total of 13.3 percent.  Management cannot at this time predict what ROE will ultimately be established by the FERC in the ongoing proceedings; however, for purposes of current earnings, the transmission business is assuming an ROE that is more conservative than that reflected in current transmission rates.
Utility Group Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters
Wholesale transmission revenues are based on rates and formulas that are approved by the FERC.  Most of NU's wholesale transmission revenues are collected through a combination of the RNS tariff and NU's LNS tariff.  NU's LNS rate is reset on January 1 and June 1 of each year.  Additionally, NU's LNS tariff provides for a true-up to actual costs, which ensures that NU recovers its total transmission revenue requirements, including the allowed ROE.  Through March 31, 2005, this true-up has resulted in the recognition of a $2.6 million regulatory liability for refund to electric distribution companies, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.
Transmission:  
On June 14, 2004, the transmission business reached a settlement agreement with the parties to its rate case, which allows NU to implement formula-based rates as proposed with an allowed ROE of 11.0 percent.  On September 16, 2004, the FERC approved the settlement agreement.  Effective February 1, 2005, the ROE was increased from 11.0 percent to the aforementioned 12.8 percent.  While management cannot at this time predict what the ultimate ROE will be, management does not believe the final approved ROE will result in a material impact on its financial statements.  Transmission segment earning guidance previously provided assumed an ROE of between 11.0 percent and 12.0 percent.  
A significant portion of NU's transmission businesses' revenue is from charges to CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  These companies recover transmission charges through rates charged to their retail customers.  WMECO has a rate tracking mechanism to track transmission costs charged in distribution rates to the actual amount of transmission charges incurred.  Higher transmission charges to WMECO were reflected in a $6 million energy delivery rate increase WMECO implemented January 1, 2005 following regulatory approval in December 2004.  The 2004 rates set in the CL&P distribution rate case contained a level of transmission revenue sufficient to recover CL&P's 2004 transmission costs.  On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P began incurring in 2005.  That applicatio n is still pending.  Additionally, legislation to allow CL&P a retail transmission tracking mechanism similar to WMECO's is pending before the Connecticut legislature.  The June 2005 PSNH rate increase from its settlement agreement contemplates higher transmission costs.  However, PSNH currently does not have a transmission rate tracking mechanism that tracks transmission costs.
In March 2004, the New England System Operator (ISO-NE) filed a proposal at the FERC to implement locational installed capacity (LICAP) requirements.  LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a fixed reserve margin and a statistically-determined contingency.  In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology.  The demand curve will be used to determine pricing.  The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings.  The hearings on the demand curve and associated issues ended on March 31, 2005 and an initial decision from the FERC is expected on June 15, 2005.  
LICAP:  
On March 23, 2005, the FERC issued two orders affirming its prior decisions regarding the LICAP market and the creation of two separate LICAP and energy zones in Connecticut.  These orders were appealed by CL&P, the DPUC, OCC, and the Connecticut Attorney General to the First Circuit Court of Appeals which dismissed the appeal without prejudice on May 5, 2005.  Management cannot at this time predict the outcome of these FERC proceedings.
If LICAP is implemented, CL&P will incur LICAP charges, in part because Connecticut is a constrained area with insufficient generation assets.  CL&P could incur LICAP costs totaling several hundred million dollars annually.  These costs would be recovered from CL&P's customers through the FMCC mechanism.  PSNH and WMECO also will incur LICAP charges, but to a lesser degree and will also recover these costs from their customers.   
Connecticut - CL&P:
Under Public Act No. 03-135, CL&P is allowed to collect a fixed procurement fee of 0.50 mills per kWh from customers who purchase TSO service.  One mill is equal to one-tenth of a cent.  That fee can increase to 0.75 mills if CL&P outperforms certain regional benchmarks.  The fixed portion of the procurement fee amounted to approximately $12 million (approximately $7 million after-tax) for 2004.  On September 15, 2004, CL&P submitted to the DPUC its proposed methodology to calculate the variable portion (incentive portion) of the procurement fee.  On November 18, 2004 the DPUC suspended this proceeding and has not indicated when the schedule will be resumed.  The variable portion of the procurement fee has not yet been reflected in earnings.  The schedule in this proceeding has not been determined, but CL&P expects to file its calculations with the DPUC in the second quarter of 2005. 
Public Act No. 03-135 and Rate Proceedings:
 
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P is incurring.  If the DPUC does not approve this deferral, CL&P's application provides for an alternate proposal to increase its retail transmission rate to recover an additional $7.6 million on an annual basis, that became effective in 2005.  Under this proposal the increase would equal $0.00031 per kWh, and would represent approximately a 0.2 percent increase in overall rates as of February 1, 2005. The discovery process is underway, and a decision in this docket is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2005.  
Retail Transmission Rate Filing:
: The CTA allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and independent power producer (IPP) over market costs, while the System Benefits Charge (SBC) allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.   
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2005, CL&P filed its 2004 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the DPUC, which compares CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, total CTA revenues exceeded the CTA revenue requirements by $14.1 million.  This amount was recorded as a regulatory liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  For the same period, SBC revenues exceeded the SBC revenue requirement by $3.6 million.  Management expects a decision in this docket from the DPUC by the end of 2005.  
In the 2001 CTA and SBC reconciliation filing, and subsequently in a September 10, 2002 petition to reopen related proceedings, CL&P requested that a deferred intercompany tax liability associated with the intercompany sale of generation assets be excluded from the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  This liability is currently included as a reduction in the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  On September 10, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision denying CL&P's request, and on October 24, 2003, CL&P appealed the DPUC's final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court.  The appeal has been fully briefed and argued.  A decision from the court is not expected to be issued until the second quarter of 2005 at the earliest.  If CL&P's request is granted and upheld through these court proceedings, there would be additional amounts due to CL&P from its customers.  The amount due is contingent upon the f indings of the court, however, management believes that CL&P's pre-tax earnings would increase by a minimum of $17 million.   
Most of CL&P's customers buy their energy at CL&P's TSO rate, rather than buying energy directly from competitive suppliers.  On December 22, 2004, the DPUC approved an increase of 16.2 percent in TSO rates effective January 1, 2005, although the impact was partially offset by a continuation of the CTA refund.  The DPUC also ordered that projected 2004 and 2005 CTA overrecoveries and half of projected 2004 distribution overrecoveries be used to moderate increases for customers that otherwise would occur when the current CTA refund expires on May 1, 2005.  Overall, the final decision approved an increase to the January 2004 TSO rates of approximately 10.4 percent, including the effects of existing and new refunds and overrecoveries.  The DPUC denied requests by the Connecticut Attorney General and OCC to defer the recovery of higher supplier costs into future years. On February& nbsp;3, 2005, the OCC filed an appeal with the Connecticut Superior Court challenging this decision.  This appeal is identical to the appeal filed with the same court in February 2004 challenging the DPUC's December 2003 decision. Management believes that this appeal will not impact the DPUC's December 22, 2004 order.
CL&P TSO Rates:   
Also, pursuant to state law, on December 19, 2003, the DPUC set CL&P's TSO rates for January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and confirmed that state law exempted FMCC, Energy Adjustment Clause (EAC) charges and certain other charges from the statutorily imposed rate cap.  The OCC filed appeals of this decision with the Connecticut Superior Court.  The OCC claims that the decision improperly implements an EAC charge under Connecticut law, fails to properly define and identify the fees that CL&P will be allowed to collect from customers and improperly calculates base rates for purposes of determining the rate cap.  Management believes that these appeals will not impact the TSO rates approved by the DPUC.
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed for a 1.6 percent increase to rates ($29.2 million) to collect additional FMCC from customers effective May 1, 2005.  The increase is necessary to collect costs related to additional RMR contracts with ISO-NE related to two generating plants located in southwest Connecticut.  The RMR contracts have preliminary approval for billing from the FERC and are subject to a future review by the FERC prior to final approval.
On April 25, 2005, CL&P filed a supplemental request to increase rates by an additional $71.1 million for a new RMR contract with ISO-NE for an unaffiliated generator which has been recently approved by the FERC.  When combined with the February 1, 2005 request of $29.2 million, CL&P is requesting approval from the DPUC to increase FMCC rates effective June 1, 2005 by $100.3 million or 6 percent annually.  If the current request for a June 1, 2005 rate increase is approved, the RMR costs being recovered in the FMCC charge would total $186 million.  In addition, the FMCC rates are also recovering $22 million related to southwest Connecticut summer emergency generation resources billed to CL&P by ISO-NE.
New Hampshire:
In accordance with the "Agreement to Settle PSNH Restructuring" and state law, PSNH files for updated TS/DS rates periodically to ensure timely recovery of its costs.  The TS/DS rate recovers PSNH's generation and purchased power costs, including a return on PSNH's generation investment. PSNH defers for future recovery or refund any difference between its TS/DS revenues and the actual costs incurred.
Transition Energy Service and Default Energy Service (TS/DS):
On January 28, 2005 the NHPUC issued its order approving a TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh for the period February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006.  This TS/DS rate currently includes an 11 percent ROE on PSNH's generation assets.  The generation ROE is currently the subject of a NHPUC docket and PSNH has filed testimony supporting an 11.4 percent ROE on its generation assets.  The NHPUC staff is advocating an ROE of 9.08 percent.  The NHPUC has scheduled hearings in the docket and a decision is expected in June 2005.  A one percent change in ROE would impact PSNH's annual net income by approximately $1 million.
The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs.  On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year.  This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues billed with stranded costs, and TS/DS revenues billed with TS/DS costs.  The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of PSNH's generation operations.  The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $224.2 million at March 31, 2005.  This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of non-securitized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $399.1 million to $174.9 million.  
SCRC Reconciliation Filing:
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on May 2, 2005.  Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis.  PSNH has included a request, and supporting testimony, to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process in its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation filing.  This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting.  At March 31, 2004, the PSNH unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs.  Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
On March 30, 2005, PSNH filed with the FERC a $1.8 million settlement agreement regarding its wholesale distribution rate case and requested that the FERC allow the revised rates to become effective on June 1, 2005.  This FERC filing was necessary due to the reclassification of certain assets from PSNH's transmission business to distribution business.  The settlement agreement allows PSNH to recover certain delivery costs arising from the provision of wholesale delivery service to another New Hampshire utility.  Management believes that the FERC will allow PSNH to recover these costs under the terms of the settlement agreement.
Wholesale Distribution Rate Case:
The New Hampshire legislature is considering a bill that would place strict limitations on the level of mercury that PSNH's existing generation plants can emit.  Management is reviewing possible legislation and how PSNH might meet any required reduction in mercury emissions should such strict limitations be established.  PSNH's alternatives range from the installation of additional pollution control equipment, reducing operating capacity of its plants, non-generation mercury mitigation programs, and possible retirement of one or more of its generating units.  While state law and PSNH's restructuring agreement provide for the recovery of its generation costs, including the cost to comply with state environmental regulations, at this time management is unable to determine the impact of any potential new legislation on PSNH's net income or financial position.  On May 4, 2005, the New Hampshire legi slature voted to retain the bill for further consideration in the 2006 session
Environmental Legislation:
.
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2005, WMECO filed its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the DTE.  This filing reconciled the recovery of generation-related stranded costs for calendar year 2004.  The DTE has combined the 2003 transition cost reconciliation filing, standard offer service and default service reconciliation, the transmission cost adjustment filing, and the 2004 transition cost reconciliation filing into a single proceeding.  A hearing schedule for the combined proceeding is expected to be set in May 2005.  The timing of a decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, but management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.
Transition Cost Reconciliation and Other Filings:
NU Enterprises
NU Enterprises currently has two business segments: the merchant energy business segment and the energy services and other business segment.
 The merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy's retail marketing business, NGC's 1,443 MW of generation assets, including 1,296 MW of primarily pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets at NGC, 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets at HWP and NGS.  The merchant energy segment also continues to include the wholesale marketing business, which NU Enterprise announced it will exit.  Management is evaluating options to maximize the value of the generation assets, including supplying retail contracts.  
Merchant Energy Segment:
 In March of 2005 NU Enterprises announced that it would explore ways to divest the energy services businesses in a manner that maximizes their value.  These businesses include the operations of E.S. Boulos Company, Woods Electrical, and NGS Mechanical, Inc., which are subsidiaries of NGS, SECI, Reeds Ferry, HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc., and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC, which are subsidiaries of SESI and Woods Network.  The subsidiaries of NGS provide third-party electrical services.  Woods Network is a network design,
Energy Services and Other Segment:
products and services company.  SESI performs energy management services for large commercial customers, institutional facilities and the United States government and energy-related construction services.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.  
 NU is not providing 2005 earnings guidance for NU Enterprises because earnings at NU Enterprises will likely be impacted by many factors, such as:
Outlook:
The application of mark-to-market accounting to most wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are settled or until the commodities are delivered.  The value of these contracts will fluctuate with changes in electricity and capacity values and with gas prices that are used to value the long-term portions of the contracts.  These changes in value will be reflected in earnings and could be significant.
 
The recognition of additional gains or losses on wholesale marketing contracts that have not been recorded yet.  Many full requirements contracts have quantities of electricity expected to be delivered in excess of the amounts currently included in the mark-to-market charge.  
Additional asset impairments or losses on disposals.  As the energy services businesses are marketed there could be additional impairments or losses on disposals to the extent sales are consummated.  NU guarantees the performance of certain energy services businesses, and the fair value of those guarantees may be recognized if they become guarantees to unaffiliated third parties.
The recognition of additional restructuring costs.  Costs associated with certain restructuring activities and employee costs will be recognized in future periods.
 There were no CL&P TSO purchases from Select Energy in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $148.5 million of CL&P standard offer purchases from Select Energy in the first quarter of 2004.  Other energy purchases between CL&P and Select Energy totaled $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2004.  WMECO purchases from Select Energy in the first quarter of 2005 totaled $20.5 million, compared to $32 million in the first quarter of 2004.  In February 2005, WMECO entered into a contract with Select Energy under which Select Energy will provide default service from April through June of 2005.  These amounts are eliminated or will be eliminated in consolidation.
Intercompany Transactions:
Included in Select Energy's restructuring and impairment charges is a negative $54.5 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge related to an intercompany contract between Select Energy and CL&P.  The contract extends through 2013 at below current market prices for CL&P.  This contract is part of CL&P's stranded costs, and benefits received by CL&P under this contract are provided to CL&P's ratepayers.  A $2.8 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss was recorded by Select Energy for the intercompany contract between Select Energy and WMECO for default service from April to June of 2005.  WMECO's benefits under this contract will be provided to ratepayers in the form of lower than market default service rates.  These charges were not eliminated in consolidation because on a consolidated basis NU retains the over-market obligation to the ratepayers of CL&P and WMECO.
NU Enterprises' Market and Other Risks
The decision to exit the wholesale marketing business has and is expected to continue to reduce the risk profile of NU Enterprises in 2005.  Until exiting the wholesale marketing business, NU Enterprises will continue to be exposed to certain market risks for existing contracts until they expire or are divested.  The merchant energy business segment will be comprised of generation assets and the retail marketing segment, which will enter into contracts of varying lengths of time to buy and sell energy commodities, including electricity, natural gas, and oil to customers.  Contracts with lower quantities and less complex terms will result in an NU Enterprises risk profile that is reduced compared to the wholesale marketing business that the company is exiting.  Market risk represents the loss that may affect the merchant energy business segment's financial results, primarily Select Energy, due to adverse changes in co mmodity market prices.
Overview:
Risk management within Select Energy has been organized to address the market, credit and operational exposures arising from the merchant energy business segment.  The framework for managing these risks is set forth in NU's risk management policies and procedures, which are reviewed by the NU Board of Trustees on an as needed basis.
A significant portion of Select Energy's merchant energy marketing activities has been providing electricity to full requirements customers, which are primarily regulated LDCs and commercial and industrial retail customers.  Under the terms of full requirements contracts, Select Energy is required to provide a percentage of the LDC's electricity requirements at all times.  The volumes sold under these contracts vary based on the usage of the LDC's retail electric customers, and usage is dependent upon factors outside of Select Energy's control, such as the weather.  The varying sales volumes could be different than the supply volumes that Select Energy expected to utilize, either from its limited generation or from electricity purchase contracts, to serve the full requirements contracts. Differences between actual sales volumes and supply volumes can require Select Energy to purchase additional electricity or sell exc ess electricity, both of which are subject to market conditions such as weather, plant availability, transmission congestion, and potentially volatile price fluctuations that can impact prices and, in turn, Select Energy's margins.
The pricing terms of full requirement contracts and of supply contracts can affect the timing of Select Energy's margins. Many full requirements contracts have higher prices in certain months, while many supply contracts have one price for the entire contract term. Accordingly, Select Energy's margins will tend to be higher in the months when the full requirements contract price is higher and lower or could be negative when the full requirements contract price is lower.
In June 2004, Select Energy began purchasing fixed-price electricity and some electricity with prices indexed to gas for 2005 and 2006 in anticipation of winning full requirements contract sales and sales to load-serving entities.  Purchasing electricity in advance created the risk of electricity price decreases before the full requirement quantities are contracted and before contract prices are known.
Energy Sourcing Activities:  
To mitigate the risk of electricity price decreases on the fixed-price electricity that was purchased, Select Energy in June 2004 began selling wholesale natural gas contracts for 2005 and 2006.  The intended result of this risk mitigation strategy was that decreases in the value of the fixed-price electricity purchase contracts would be offset in part by increases in the value of the gas contracts, and vice versa.  Select Energy intended to purchase natural gas when quantities and prices of electricity are secured by full requirements contracts or sales contracts with load-serving entities.  Natural gas was sold in this risk mitigation strategy due to the high liquidity of the natural gas market compared to the low liquidity of physical electricity supply in New England.   
The electricity contracts were accounted for on the accrual basis through 2004, which would have resulted in earnings recognition when the electricity would have been delivered to customers in 2005 and 2006.  These electricity purchase contracts were to be used to meet electricity sales contract requirements, which was a key component of the merchant energy wholesale marketing business. Until the decision to exit wholesale marketing activities was made, management believed that this electricity would be delivered to its customers.  The decision in March 2005 to exit the wholesale marketing business changed management's conclusion regarding the likelihood that many wholesale marketing contracts would result in physical delivery to customers.  This in turn resulted in a change in the first quarter of 2005 from accrual accounting to fair value accounting for the wholesale marketing contracts.  
The natural gas contracts are recorded at current fair value.  At March 31, 2005 the fair value of the natural gas contracts was a negative $80.9 million.  The changes in fair values totaling a negative $77.7 million increased fuel, purchased and net interchange power in 2004.  An additional change in fair value of a negative $40.7 million increased fuel, purchased and net interchange power in the first quarter of 2005.  $37.5 million of the negative fair value was realized in the first quarter of 2005, much of which was deposited with a broker in 2004.  Of the total fair value of negative $80.9 million, approximately negative $58.9 million relates to 2005 with approximately negative $22 million related to 2006.   
In the first quarter of 2005, the electricity and natural gas positions that were part of energy sourcing activities were balanced, and changes in the fair value of these contracts are no longer expected to impact earnings.  Overall, energy sourcing activities resulted in an after-tax loss of $28 million, comprised of an after-tax loss of $48 million in 2004 and an after-tax gain of $20 million in the first quarter of 2005.  Cash flows from these contracts are expected to be positive for the remainder of 2005 and 2006 as the electricity positions are realized.  
The electricity and natural gas contracts are included in non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in the table in Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Select Energy manages its portfolio of retail marketing contracts to maximize value while operating within NU's corporate risk tolerance.  Select Energy generally acquires retail customers in small increments, which while requiring careful sourcing allows energy purchases to be acquired in small increments with low risk.  However, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
Retail Marketing Activities:   
The generation assets, either owned by NU Enterprises or contracted with third parties, are subject to certain operational risks, including but not limited to the length of scheduled and non-scheduled outages, bidding and scheduling with various ISOs, environmental issues and fuel costs.  Generation is also subject to various federal, state and local regulations.  These risks may
Generation Activities:  
result in changes in the anticipated gross margins which Select Energy realizes from its generation portfolio/activities.  A significant determinant of the future value of generation assets is the implementation of LICAP.
In March 2004, the ISO-NE filed a proposal at the FERC to implement LICAP requirements. LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a fixed reserve margin and a statistically-determined contingency.  In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology.  The demand curve will be used to determine pricing.  The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings.  The hearings on the demand curve and associated issues ended on March 31, 2005 and an initial decision from the FERC is expected on June 15, 2005.  
Depending on the pricing curves that are ultimately implemented, LICAP could produce significant benefits for generation assets either owned or contracted by NU Enterprises.  NU Enterprises owns or contracts approximately 300 MW of generation assets in Connecticut and approximately 1,300 MW of generation assets in western Massachusetts.
For information on derivatives used for hedging purposes and non-trading derivatives, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Hedging and Other Non-Trading:
Historically, energy trading transactions at Select Energy have included financial transactions and physical delivery transactions for electricity, natural gas and oil in which Select Energy attempted to profit from changes in market prices.  Energy trading contracts are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value affect net income.
Wholesale Contracts Defined as "Energy Trading":  
At March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, Select Energy had trading derivative assets and trading derivative liabilities as follows:   
There can be no assurances that Select Energy will realize cash corresponding to the present positive net fair value of its trading positions.  Numerous factors could either positively or negatively affect the realization of the net fair value amount in cash.  These include the sales price to be received on the sale of these contracts, the volatility of commodity prices until the contracts are sold, the outcome of future transactions, the performance of counterparties, and other factors.
Select Energy has policies and procedures requiring all trading positions to be marked-to-market at the end of each business day and segregating responsibilities between the individuals actually trading (front office) and those confirming the trades (middle office).  The determination of the portfolio's fair value is the responsibility of the middle office independent from the front office.
The methods used to determine the fair value of energy trading contracts are identified and segregated in the table of fair value of contracts at March 31, 2005.  A description of each method is as follows: 1) prices actively quoted primarily represent New York Mercantile Exchange futures and options that are marked to closing exchange prices; and 2) prices provided by external sources primarily include over-the-counter forwards and options, including bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, and are marked to the mid-point of bid and ask market prices.  Currently, Select Energy has one contract for which a portion of the contract's fair value is determined based on a model or other valuation method.  The model utilizes natural gas prices and a conversion factor to electricity.  The fair value of this contract at December 31, 2004 was $5.5 million, net of a modeling reserve that reduced the value of the c ontract to zero for years beyond 2007 that did not have liquid prices.  In the first quarter of 2005 the modeling reserve was reversed, and the fair value of this contract at March 31, 2005, which now includes prices provided by external sources for 2008, is now $25.5 million.  Broker quotes for electricity at locations for which Select Energy has entered into deals are available through the year 2008.  For all natural gas positions, broker quotes extend through 2013.
Generally, valuations of short-term contracts derived from quotes or other external sources are more reliable should there be a need to liquidate the contracts, while valuations for longer-term contracts are less certain.  Accordingly, there is a risk that contracts will not be realized at the amounts recorded.  However, Select Energy has obtained corresponding purchase or sale contracts for a large portion of the trading contracts that have maturities in excess of one year.  Because these trading contracts are sourced, changes in the value of these contracts due to fluctuations in commodity prices are not expected to significantly affect Select Energy's earnings.
As of and for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the sources of the fair value of trading contracts and the changes in fair value of these trading contracts are included in the following tables.  Intercompany transactions are eliminated and not reflected in the amounts below.
The fair value of energy trading contracts increased to $47.5 million at March 31, 2005 from $29.6 million at December 31, 2004. The change in the fair value of the trading portfolio is primarily attributable to the change in valuation technique on the contract that is marked to model.  
For further information regarding Select Energy's derivative contracts, see Note 3, "Derivative Instruments," and Note 7, "Comprehensive Income," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
 In general, the market for energy products has become shorter term in nature with less liquidity, market pricing information is less readily available and participants are sometimes unable to meet Select Energy's credit standards without providing cash or LOC support.  Select Energy is being adversely affected by these factors, and there could be a continuing adverse impact on Select Energy.   
Changing Market:
Changes are occurring in the administration of transmission systems in territories in which Select Energy does business.  As the market continues to evolve, there could be additional challenges or opportunities that management cannot determine at this time.
Counterparty credit risk relates to the risk of loss that Select Energy would incur because of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  Select Energy has established written credit policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk.  These policies require an evaluation of potential counterparties' financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances (including cash advances, LOCs, and parent guarantees), and the use of standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  This evaluation results in establishing credit limits prior to Select Energy's entering into contracts.  The appropriateness of these limits is subject to continuing review. Concentrations among these counterparties may affect Select Energy's overall ex posure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes to economic, regulatory or other conditions.  At March 31, 2005, approximately 73 percent of Select Energy's counterparty credit exposure to wholesale and trading counterparties was collateralized or rated BBB- or better.  Select Energy was provided $95.6 million and $57.7 million of counterparty deposits at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  For further information, see Note 1K, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Counterparty Deposits," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Counterparty Credit:
A number of Select Energy's contracts require the posting of additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs in the event NU's ratings were to decline and in increasing amounts dependent upon the severity of the decline.  At NU's present
Select Energy's Credit:  
investment grade ratings, Select Energy has not had to post any collateral based on credit downgrades.  Were NU's unsecured ratings to decline two levels to sub-investment grade, Select Energy could, under its present contracts, be asked to provide at March 31, 2005 approximately $500 million of collateral or LOCs to various unaffiliated counterparties and approximately $154 million to several independent system operators and unaffiliated LDCs, which management believes NU would currently be able to provide, subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) limits.  NU's credit ratings outlooks are currently stable or negative, but management does not believe that at this time there is a significant risk of a ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade levels.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Update
The application of derivative accounting under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, is complex and requires management judgment in the several respects, including the determination of the fair value of derivatives.  Most of the contracts comprising Select Energy's wholesale and retail marketing activities are derivatives.  The fair value of contracts in the trading portfolio and contracts that have been marked-to-market as restructuring charges has been determined by prices provided by external sources and actively quoted markets through 2008.  Certain contracts have also been modeled for years after 2008 utilizing natural gas prices and a conversion factor to estimate electricity prices.  Judgments made by management in determining the fair value of derivatives can have a significant impact on NU's con solidated net income.
Derivative Accounting and Fair Value Determination:  
In the first quarter of 2005, NU recorded restructuring and impairment charges associated with NU Enterprises' decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and to divest the energy services businesses in a separate restructuring line item within operating expenses.  Management has evaluated the classification of these charges to determine if these charges should be presented as discontinued operations and as of March 31, 2005 concluded that these charges should not be classified as discontinued operations.  Management will continue to evaluate this classification in the second quarter of 2005.  Under current accounting guidance, in order for discontinued operations treatment to be appropriate, management must conclude that there is a component of a business that is "held for sale" for accounting purposes.  During the third quarter of 2005, management determine d that it expects to divest four of the energy services businesses within the next year.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2005, SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical were accounted for as discontinued operations.
Evaluation of Discontinued Operations Presentation:  
 In the first quarter of 2005, management adopted a new method to estimate unbilled revenues for CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas.  The new method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle.  The billed sales are subtracted from total calendar month sales to estimate unbilled sales.  The impact of adopting the new method was not material.  The new method replaces the requirements method and the cycle method that were used periodically to test the requirements method.
Unbilled Revenues:

Risk Factors
NU is subject to a variety of significant risks in addition to the matters set forth under "Other Matters" above.  The company's susceptibility to
certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks.  These risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company's risk profile.
On April 29, 2005, NU announced charges associated with the March 2005 decision to exit its wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses.  NU Enterprises is exploring a number of alternatives for exiting these businesses.
Risks Related to Disposition of Wholesale Competitive and Services Businesses:  
While the energy services businesses present a lower level of volatility and risk, the wholesale marketing business, until disposed of, will continue to present financial risk to NU from a variety of perspectives.  These include earnings volatility around Select Energy's portfolio of electric supply contracts, which will be accounted for on a mark-to-market, rather than accrual, basis until disposed of or restructured.  The earnings charge referred to above may not be adequate to absorb future negative price movements which may occur or if further charges are taken if the portfolio is sold or restructured.  
In connection with its first quarter 2005 loss, NU has received a waiver of certain covenants in its loan agreements for the first quarter of 2005 and future losses may require NU to request additional waivers.  NU cannot predict what impact the need for such waivers might have.  In addition, Select Energy's ability to function will continue to be dependant upon the financial reliability of its counterparties and its ability to manage its wholesale marketing portfolio of contracts and assets within acceptable risk parameters.
In March 2005, NU announced it intended to stay in the retail competitive energy and generating businesses.  Select Energy generally acquires retail customer load in small increments, which while requiring careful sourcing, allows energy assets to be acquired with lower risk.  While retail customers have a generally high retention rate, they normally contract for periods of one to two years, making long-term load servicing difficult to evaluate.  In addition, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
Risks Related to Retained Retail Competitive and Generation Businesses:  
The competitive generation business is also subject to these risks.  In addition, the future value of LICAP credits have not been determined and are subject to regulatory decision-making over which NU has no control.  
NU, primarily through its subsidiary CL&P, has undertaken a substantial transmission capital investment program over the past several years and expects to invest more than $1.5 billion in regulated electric transmission infrastructure from 2005 through 2009.  Included in this amount is approximately $1.4 billion for costs associated with construction of two Connecticut 345 kV transmission lines from Middletown to Norwalk and Bethel to Norwalk; replacement of an undersea electric transmission line between Norwalk and Northport, New York; and two 115 kV underground transmission lines between Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut.  The regulatory approval process for these transmission projects has encompassed an extensive permitting, design and technical approval process.  Various factors have resulted in increased cost estimates and delayed constru ction.  
Risks Associated With The Transmission Operations Of NU's Utility Subsidiaries:  
The projects are expected to help alleviate reliability issues in southwest Connecticut and to help reduce customers' costs in all of Connecticut.  However, if, due to further regulatory or other delays, the projected in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed, there may be increased risk of failures in the existing electricity transmission system in southwestern Connecticut and supply interruptions or blackouts may occur.  
The successful implementation of NU's transmission construction plans is also subject to the risk that new legislation, regulations or judicial or regulatory interpretations of applicable law or regulations could impact NU's ability to meet its construction schedule and/or require NU to incur additional expenses, and may adversely affect its ability to achieve forecasted levels of revenues.
Unless CL&P is able to increase rates to recover these construction costs on a timely basis, certain of NU's and CL&P's financial ratios may decline and CL&P's ability to pay dividends to NU to support its common dividend and interest requirements may be weakened.
CL&P and WMECO procure energy for a substantial portion of their customers via requests for proposal on an annual, semi-annual or quarterly basis.  There is a risk that any given solicitation will not be fully subscribed or that prices will be much higher than current prices.  CL&P and WMECO receive approvals of recovery of these contract prices from the DPUC and DTE, respectively.  While both regulators have consistently approved solicitation processes, results and recovery of costs, management cannot predict the outcome of future solicitation efforts or the regulatory proceedings related thereto.
Risks Associated with the Distribution Operations of NU's Utility Subsidiaries:  
NU and its affiliates are engaged in litigation that could result in the imposition of large cash awards against them.  This litigation includes 1) civil lawsuits between Consolidated Edison, Inc. and NU relating to the parties' October 13, 1999 Agreement and Plan of Merger and 2) the termination of a decommissioning contract between CYAPC, the stock of which is 49
Litigation-Related Risks:
percent owned by subsidiaries of NU, and Bechtel.  
Further information regarding these legal proceedings, as well as other matters, is set forth in Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," in NU's Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1, "Legal Proceedings" of this Form 10-Q.
NU may also be subject to future litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims and cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings.  Adverse outcomes in existing or future litigation could result in the imposition of substantial cash damage awards against us.  
NU's subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations which regulate, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste.  Compliance with these requirements requires NU to incur significant costs relating to environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation and permitting.  The costs of compliance with these legal requirements may increase in the future.  An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on NU's business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
Risks Associated With Environmental Regulation:
NU's failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if due to factors beyond its control or reinterpretations of existing requirements could also increase costs.  
Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NU.  Revised or additional laws could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on NU's facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable in rates.  The cost impact of any such legislation would be dependent upon the specific requirements adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

(a) Percent greater than 100.
Comparison of the First Quarter of 2005 to the First Quarter of 2004
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues increased $434 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004, due to higher revenues from NU Enterprises ($289 million), higher electric distribution revenues ($116 million), higher gas distribution revenues ($24 million), and higher regulated transmission revenues ($6 million).  
The NU Enterprises' revenue increase of $289 million is primarily due to additional third party volume ($172 million), higher revenues for the merchant retail energy business ($69 million) and higher revenues for the wholesale marketing business ($39 million).  Higher revenues for the merchant retail energy business resulted from higher gas volumes ($27 million), higher electric volumes ($23 million), higher gas prices ($10 million), and higher electricity prices ($8 million).  Higher revenues for the wholesale marketing business resulted from higher electricity prices ($60 million), trading ($12 million) and higher gas volumes ($12 million), partially offset by lower electric volumes ($44 million).  
The electric distribution revenue increase of $116 million is primarily due to non-earnings components of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail rates ($106 million).  The distribution component of these companies and the retail transmission component of CL&P and PSNH which flow through to earnings increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in retail rates ($13 million), partially offset by a decrease in retail sales volumes ($3 million).  The non-earnings components increase of $106 million is primarily due to the pass through of higher energy supply costs ($90 million) and CL&P FMCC ($36 million), partially offset by lower wholesale revenues ($9 million) due to lower sales volumes, lower CL&P conservation and load management cost recoveries ($6 million) and lower transition cost recoveries for CL&P and WMECO ($4 million).  Regulated retail sales decreased 1.0 percent in 2005 compared with 2004.  
The higher gas distribution revenue of $24 million is primarily due to the increased recovery of gas costs ($19 million).
Transmission revenues increased $6 million in the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses.
Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power
Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expense increased $448 million in the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to higher purchased power costs for the Utility Group ($293 million) and higher wholesale costs at NU Enterprises ($156 million).  The $293 million increase for the Utility Group is primarily due to an increase in the standard offer supply costs for CL&P and WMECO ($233 million), which includes higher third party supplier volume ($160 million), higher expenses for PSNH ($24 million) primarily due to higher energy and capacity purchases and higher Yankee Gas expenses ($19 million) primarily due to increased gas prices.
Other Operation
Other operation expenses increased $39 million in the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to higher CL&P reliability must run costs and other power pool related expenses ($21 million) and higher expenses for NU Enterprises ($12 million).  The higher expenses for NU Enterprises were primarily due to higher expenses at the energy services businesses ($7 million), higher transmission expenses ($2 million) and higher pension expense ($1 million).
Wholesale Contract Market Changes, Net
See Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes and Restructuring and Impairment Charges," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description and explanation of these amounts.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
See Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes and Restructuring and Impairment Charges," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description and explanation of these charges.
Depreciation
Depreciation increased $3 million in the first quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher CL&P plant balances.
Amortization
Amortization decreased $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 primarily due to lower Utility Group recovery of stranded costs.
Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds
Amortization of rate reduction bonds increased $3 million in the first quarter of 2005 due to the repayment of a higher principal amount as compared to 2004.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased $4 million in the first quarter of 2005 primarily due to the issuance of $280 million of ten-year and thirty-year first mortgage bonds at CL&P in September 2004 and higher interest rates for NU Parent.
 
Income Tax (Benefit)/Expense
Income tax (benefit)/expense decreased $99 million primarily due to lower income before tax expense and a lower effective tax rate due to write-offs of non-deductible goodwill and intangibles and increases in the deferred tax valuation allowance on state tax benefits at NU Enterprises.  
Net Loss From Discontinued Operations
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the loss income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income.  See Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.

Exhibit 99.3
On November 7, 2005, Northeast Utilities (NU) reported discontinued operations in its report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 as a result of meeting certain accounting criteria requiring this presentation.  NU presented in its third quarter 2005 report on Form 10-Q the operating results of the following companies as discontinued operations:  
Select Energy Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC;
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc.), a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc.;

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (All Companies)
A.
Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with this report on Form 10-Q and the Annual Reports of Northeast Utilities (NU or the company), The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), which were filed as part of the NU 2004 Form 10-K, and the current reports on Form 8-K disclosed in Part II, Item 6,"Other Information - Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K" included in NU's original report on Form 10-Q.  The condensed consolidated financial statements contain, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal, recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly NU's and the above companies' financial position at June 30, 2005, and the results of operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.  The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year.  
The condensed consolidated financial statements of NU and of its subsidiaries, as applicable, include the accounts of all their respective subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to present the operations for the following companies as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria in the third quarter of 2005 requiring this presentation:
Select Energy Services, Inc. (SESI) and its wholly owned subsidiaries HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc. and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC;
Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (including Reeds Ferry Supply Co., Inc. (Reeds Ferry))  (SECI-NH), a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc (SECI);
Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network); and
Woods Electrical Co., Inc. (Woods Electrical).
For further information regarding these companies, see Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  NU's condensed consolidated balance sheets were not impacted by this revision.
Certain reclassifications of prior period data included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been made to conform with the current period presentation.  These reclassifications related to other operation and maintenance expense and maintenance expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income which totaled $19.4 million and $34.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively.  
In the company's condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2004, the company changed the classification of the change in restricted cash - LMP costs balances to present that change as an investing activity.  The company previously presented that change as an operating activity which resulted in a $30.3 million increase to net cash flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase to operating cash flows from the amounts previously reported.  
The NU, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2004 have also been reclassified to exclude from cash flows from operations the change in accounts payable related to capital projects consistent with the December 31, 2004 presentation.  These amounts totaled sources/(uses) of cash of $8.8 million, $15.8 million, $(3.9) million, and $(0.4) million for the six months ended June 30, 2004 for NU, CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO, respectively.
B.
New Accounting Standards
On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payments," (SFAS No. 123R), which amended SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."  SFAS No. 123R will require NU to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on January 1, 2006, the effective date of SFAS No. 123R, and any new awards after that date.  NU is currently determining the amount of compensation expense to be recognized, but management believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have a material impact on NU's consolidated financial statements.  For further information regarding equity-based compensation, see Note 1F, "Equity-Based Compensation," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Payments:  
On January 1, 2003, NU implemented SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requiring legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment to be recognized as a liability at fair value when incurred and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made.  Management identified certain potential asset retirement obligations relating to transmission and distribution lines and poles, telecommunication towers, transmission cables, certain assets containing asbestos, and certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or state regulatory agency re-licensing issues, and determined that no material asset retirement obligations had been incurred.  In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." &n bsp;FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 is required to be implemented on December 31, 2005, with a liability for conditional asset retirements and the cumulative effect of implementation to be recognized in the financial statements.  Management is currently evaluating NU's conditional asset retirement obligations and cannot yet reasonably estimate the impact of FIN 47 on NU's financial statements.
Asset Retirement Obligations:  
C.
Guarantees
NU provides credit assurance on behalf of subsidiaries in the form of guarantees and letters of credit (LOCs) in the normal course of business, primarily for the financial performance obligations of NU Enterprises, Inc. (NU Enterprises).  NU would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of non-performance by NU Enterprises, primarily Select Energy, Inc. (Select Energy).  At June 30, 2005, the maximum level of exposure in accordance with FIN 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," under guarantees by NU, primarily on behalf of NU Enterprises, totaled $967.1 million.  A majority of these guarantees do not have established expiration dates.  Additionally, NU had $78.3 million of LOCs issued, of which $76.3 million were issued for the benefit of NU Enterprises at June 30, 2005.
At June 30, 2005, NU had outstanding guarantees on behalf of the Utility Group and Rocky River Realty (RRR) of $13 million and $11.1 million, respectively.  These amounts are included in the total outstanding NU guarantee exposure amount of $967.1 million.  The remaining guarantee amount of $943 million is for NU Enterprises, of which $663.8 million relates to Select Energy and $279.2 million relates to the energy services businesses.  The $279.2 million in guarantees related to the energy services businesses is comprised of $97.8 million related to guarantees of SESI's obligations under certain financing arrangements and $181.4 million related to performance obligations of the energy services businesses.
Several underlying contracts that NU guarantees, as well as certain surety bonds, contain credit ratings triggers that would require NU to post collateral in the event that NU's credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade.
NU currently has authorization from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide up to $750 million of guarantees for its non-utility subsidiaries through June 30, 2007.  The $13 million in outstanding guarantees to the Utility Group are subject to a separate $50 million SEC limitation apart from the current $750 million NU Enterprises guarantee limit.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit for NU Enterprises at June 30, 2005 is $458.5 million.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit for the Utility Group at June 30, 2005 is $0.3 million.  These amounts are calculated using different, more probabilistic and fair-value based criteria than the maximum level of exposure required to be disclosed under FIN 45.  FIN 45 includes all exposures even though they are not reasonably likely to result in exposure to NU.
On October 19, 2004, the SEC authorized NU to issue guarantees of up to an aggregate $100 million through June 30, 2007 of the debt or other obligations of two of its subsidiaries, Northeast Utilities Service Company and RRR.  These companies provide certain specialized support and real estate services and occasionally enter into transactions that require financial backing from NU.  The amount of guarantees outstanding for compliance with the SEC limit under this category at June 30, 2005 is $0.2 million.
D.
Regulatory Accounting
The accounting policies of the Utility Group conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation."
The transmission and distribution businesses of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, along with PSNH's generation business and Yankee Gas Services Company's (Yankee Gas) distribution business, continue to be cost-of-service rate regulated, and management believes that the application of SFAS No. 71 to those businesses continues to be appropriate.  Management also believes that it is probable that the Utility Group will recover its investments in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets.  In addition, all material net regulatory assets are earning an equity return, except for securitized regulatory assets, which are not supported by equity.
 The components of regulatory assets are as follows:  
Regulatory Assets:
Included in WMECO's other regulatory assets/(overrecoveries) are $43.1 million and $50.7 million at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, of amounts related to WMECO's rate cap deferral.  The rate cap deferral allows WMECO to recover stranded costs and these amounts represent the cumulative excess of transition cost revenues over transition cost expenses.
Additionally, the Utility Group had $12.8 million and $11.6 million of regulatory costs at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, that are included in deferred debits and other assets - other on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These amounts represent regulatory costs that have not yet been approved by the applicable regulatory agency.  Management believes these assets are recoverable in future rates.
As discussed in Note 6D, "Commitments and Contingencies - Deferred Contractual Obligations," a substantial portion of the unrecovered contractual obligations regulatory asset has not yet been approved for recovery.  At this time management believes that these regulatory assets are probable of recovery.
 The Utility Group had $1.1 billion of regulatory liabilities at both June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004.  These amounts include revenues subject to refund which are classified as regulatory liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These amounts are comprised of the following:
Regulatory Liabilities:
E.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
The allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a non-cash item that is included in the cost of Utility Group utility plant and represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction.  The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction in other interest expense and the cost of equity funds is recorded as other income on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income as follows:
The average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula that develops an average rate using the cost of the company's short-term financings as well as the company's capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity).  The average rate is applied to eligible construction work in progress amounts to calculate AFUDC.
F.
Equity-Based Compensation
NU maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and other long-term, equity-based incentive plans under the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan.  NU accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB)  Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," (APB No. 25) and related interpretations.  No equity-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share (EPS) if NU had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to equity-based employee compensation:  
Net (loss)/income, as reported, includes $1 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $1.4 million and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units.  NU accounts for restricted stock in accordance with APB No. 25 and amortizes the intrinsic value of the award over the related service period.
NU assumes an income tax rate of 40 percent to estimate the tax effect on total equity-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value-based method for all awards.
During the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, no stock options were awarded.
For information regarding new accounting standards issued but not yet effective associated with equity-based compensation, see Note 1B, "New Accounting Standards," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
G.
Sale of Customer Receivables
At June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, CL&P had sold an undivided interest in its accounts receivable of $60 million and $90 million, respectively, to a financial institution with limited recourse through CL&P Receivables Corporation (CRC), a wholly owned subsidiary of CL&P.  CRC can sell up to $100 million of an undivided interest in its accounts receivable and unbilled revenues.  At June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the reserve requirements calculated in accordance with the Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement were $14.3 million and $18.8 million, respectively.  These reserve amounts are deducted from the amount of receivables eligible for sale at the time.  Concentrations of credit risk to the purchaser under this agreement with respect to the receivables are limited due to CL&P's diverse customer base within its service territory.
At June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, amounts sold to CRC by CL&P but not sold to the financial institution totaling $247.9 million and $139.4 million, respectively, are included in investments in securitizable assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These amounts would be excluded from CL&P's assets in the event of CL&P's bankruptcy.  On July 6, 2005, CRC renewed its Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement with CL&P and the financial institution through July 5, 2006, and in 2004 extended the termination date of the facility to July 3, 2007.  CL&P's continuing involvement with the receivables that are sold to CRC and the financial institution is limited to servicing those receivables.  
The transfer of receivables to the financial institution under this arrangement qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities - A Replacement of SFAS No. 125."
H.
Other Investments
Yankee Energy System, Inc. (Yankee) maintains a long-term note receivable from BMC Energy, LLC (BMC), an operator of renewable energy projects.  In the first quarter of 2004, based on revised information that negatively impacted undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value estimates, management determined that the fair value of the note receivable from BMC had declined and that the note was impaired.  As a result, management recorded a pre-tax investment write-down of $2.5 million ($1.5 million on an after-tax basis) in the first quarter of 2004.  In the second quarter of 2005, based upon additional revised information that negatively impacted the fair value of the BMC note receivable, management recorded an additional pre-tax investment write-down of $0.8 million ($0.5 million on an after-tax basis).  Yankee's remaining note receivable from BMC totaled $0.5 million at June 30, 2005.
NU has an investment in the common stock of a developer of fuel cell and power quality equipment.  Based on revised information that affected the fair value of NU's investment, management determined that at June 30, 2004, the value of NU's investment had declined and that decline was other than temporary in nature.  An after-tax investment write-down of $2.4 million ($3.8 million on a pre-tax basis) was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the investment.  
NU owns 49 percent of the common stock of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC) with a carrying value of $22 million at June 30, 2005.  CYAPC is involved in litigation over the termination of its decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel).  CYAPC filed with the FERC to recover the increased estimate of decommissioning and plant closure costs.  The FERC proceeding is ongoing.  Management believes that this litigation and the FERC proceeding have not impaired the value of its investment in CYAPC at June 30, 2005 but will continue to evaluate the impacts that the litigation and the FERC proceeding have on NU's investment.  For further information regarding the Bechtel litigation, see Note 6D, "Commitments and Contingencies - Deferred Contractual Obligations," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less.  At the end of each reporting period, overdraft amounts are reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to accounts payable.
J.
Special Deposits
Special deposits represents amounts Select Energy has on deposit with unaffiliated counterparties and brokerage firms in the amount of $82.2 million and amounts included in escrow for SESI that have not been spent on construction projects of $12.3 million at June 30, 2005.  Similar amounts totaled $46.3 million and $20 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004.  Special deposits at December 31, 2004 also included $16.3 million in escrow for Yankee Gas, which represented payment for Yankee Gas' first mortgage bonds due on June 1, 2005.
K.
Counterparty Deposits
Balances collected from counterparties resulting from Select Energy's credit management activities totaled $102.2 million at June 30, 2005 and $57.7 million at December 31, 2004.  These amounts are recorded as current liabilities and included as counterparty deposits on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  To the extent Select Energy requires collateral from counterparties, cash is received as a part of the total collateral required.  The right to receive such cash collateral in an unrestricted manner is determined by the terms of Select Energy's agreements.  Key factors affecting the unrestricted status of a portion of this cash collateral include the financial standing of Select Energy and of NU as its credit supporter.
L.
Other Income/(Loss)
The pre-tax components of NU's other income/(loss) items are as follows:
Investment income includes equity in earnings of regional nuclear generating and transmission companies of $1 million and $0.8 million of income for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $1.9 million and $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Equity in earnings relates to NU's investment in the Yankee Companies and the Hydro-Quebec system.
None of the amounts in either other income - other or other loss - other are individually significant based on applicable accounting rules.
2.
WHOLESALE CONTRACT MARKET CHANGES (NU, NU Enterprises)
NU Enterprises recorded $69.6 million and $258.5 million of pre-tax wholesale contract market changes for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, related to the changes in the fair value of wholesale contracts that the company is in the process of divesting.  These amounts are reported as wholesale contract market changes, net on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.   A summary of those pre-tax charges (benefits) is as follows (millions of dollars):  
The $64.2 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005, relates to the change since March 31, 2005 in the negative mark-to-market on certain long-term below-market wholesale electricity contracts.  The decision in March 2005 to exit the wholesale marketing business changed management's conclusion regarding the likelihood that these wholesale marketing contracts would result in physical delivery to customers.  This in turn resulted in a change in the first quarter of 2005 from accrual accounting to fair value accounting for the wholesale marketing contracts.  The company is seeking to divest these contracts.  Additional wholesale contract market changes will be recognized as incurred and will include net losses on the disposition of wholesale marketing contracts, including the value of full requirements electricity contract quantities to be delivered in excess of their notional amounts.
The $5.4 million relates to a decrease in the mark-to-market on certain retail marketing supply contracts and other wholesale contracts related to electricity for delivery to customers primarily in 2005 and 2006.  
Included in the mark-to-market on long-term wholesale electricity contracts is a $15.7 million and $70.2 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, related to an intercompany contract between Select Energy and CL&P.  The contract extends through 2013 at below current market prices for CL&P.  This contract is part of CL&P's stranded costs, and benefits received by CL&P under this contract are provided to CL&P's ratepayers.  A $2.8 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three months ended March 31, 2005, was recorded as wholesale contract market changes by Select Energy for the intercompany contract between Select Energy and WMECO for default service from April to June of 2005.  There were no wholesale contract market changes in the second quarter of 2005 as this contract expired on June 30, 2005.  WMECO's benefits under this contr act will be provided to ratepayers in the form of lower than market default service rates.  These charges were not eliminated in consolidation because on a consolidated basis NU retains the over-market obligation to the ratepayers of CL&P and WMECO.
For information regarding wholesale current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities that are being divested, see Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE (NU, NU Enterprises)
NU Enterprises recorded $2.3 million and $47.8 million of pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 related to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and to divest its energy services businesses.  The amounts related to continuing operations are included as restructuring and impairment charges on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income with the remainder included in discontinued operations.  A summary of those pre-tax charges is as follows (millions of dollars):  
Restructuring and Impairment Charges:  
On March 9, 2005, NU announced that it had completed its comprehensive review of the NU Enterprises businesses.  In the first quarter of 2005, an exclusivity agreement intangible asset totaling $7.2 million related to the merchant energy business was written off.  
NU Enterprises hired an outside firm to assist in valuing its energy services businesses and their divestiture.  Based in part on that firm's work, the company concluded that $29.1 million of goodwill associated with those businesses and $9.2 million of intangible assets were impaired as of March 31, 2005.  An impairment charge of $38.3 million was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2005.  
In the second quarter of 2005, pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $1 million were recorded by merchant energy related to professional fees, employee-related and other costs.  In the second quarter of 2005, the energy services businesses and NU Enterprises parent recorded an additional impairment charge of $0.8 million due to the impairment of certain fixed assets and other pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $0.5 million related to professional fees, employee-related and other costs in conjunction with the divestiture of the energy services businesses.  Additional restructuring charges will be recognized as incurred and may include professional fees and employee-related and other costs.
On March 9, 2005, NU Enterprises announced that it would explore ways to divest its energy services businesses in a manner that would maximize their value.  Certain assets and liabilities of Select Energy Contracting, Inc. - New Hampshire (SECI-NH), a division of Select Energy Contracting, Inc. (SECI) that provides mechanical and electrical contracting services in new construction and service contracts, and Woods Network Services, Inc. (Woods Network), a subsidiary of NU Enterprises that is a network products and services company, are currently being accounted for as held for sale, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  SECI-NH and Woods Network are reported as part of the services and other segment of NU Enterprises.  Management expects to complete these sales by the end of 2005.  
Assets Held for Sale:  
For SECI-NH, the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale were accounts receivable of $5 million and accounts payable of $3 million.  For Woods Network, the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale were accounts receivable of $3 million and accounts payable of $1 million.
4.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (NU, CL&P, Select Energy, Yankee Gas)
Contracts that are derivatives and do not meet the definition of a cash flow hedge and cannot be designated as being used for normal purchases or normal sales are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings.  For those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative and meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in the fair value of the effective portion of those contracts are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions occur.  For contracts that meet the definition of a derivative but do not meet the hedging requirements, and for the ineffective portion of contracts that meet the cash flow hedge requirements, the changes in fair value of those contracts are recognized currently in earnings.  Derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges and the item they are hedging are both recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized currently i n earnings.  Derivative contracts that are entered into as a normal purchase or sale and will result in physical delivery, and are documented as such, are recognized in revenue and expense when such deliveries occur.  
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, a negative $0.3 million, net of tax, was reclassified as expense from other comprehensive income in connection with the consummation of the underlying hedged transactions and recognized in earnings and a negative $2.4 million, net of tax, was reclassified as expense from other comprehensive income related to the mark-to-market changes for wholesale contracts that NU Enterprises is in the process of divesting.  Also during the first half of 2005, new cash flow hedge transactions were entered into that hedge cash flows through 2010.  As a result of the consummation of the transactions, these new transactions and market value changes since January 1, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income increased by $5.4 million, net of tax.  Accumulated other comprehensive income at June 30, 2005, was a positive $1.9 million, net of tax (increase to equity), relating to hedged transactions, and it is estimated that a positive $0.6 million included in this net of tax balance will be reclassified as an increase to earnings within the next twelve months.  Cash flows from hedge contracts are reported in the same category as cash flows from the underlying hedged transaction.  
There was a negative pre-tax impact of $0.3 million recognized in earnings in the second quarter 2005 for the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.  A negative pre-tax $0.7 million was recognized in earnings in the second quarter 2005 for the ineffective portion of fair value hedges.  The changes in the fair value of both the fair value hedges and the natural gas inventory being hedged are recorded in fuel, purchased, and net interchange power on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.  
The table below summarizes current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities at June 30, 2005.  At June 30, 2005, derivative assets and liabilities have been segregated between wholesale, retail and hedging amounts.  Management is in the process of divesting the contracts included in the wholesale category as a result of the March 9, 2005 decision to exit this portion of the business.  
The business activities of NU Enterprises that result in the recognition of derivative assets include concentrations of credit risk to energy marketing and trading counterparties.  At June 30, 2005, Select Energy had $419.4 million of derivative assets from retail, wholesale, and hedging activities.  These assets are exposed to counterparty credit risk.  However, a significant portion of these assets is contracted with investment grade rated counterparties or collateralized with cash.  
The amounts above do not include option premiums paid, which are recorded as prepayments and amounted to $14.6 million and $29.3 million related to wholesale activities at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  These amounts also do not include option premiums received, which are recorded as other current liabilities and amounted to $13.3 million and $27.1 million related to wholesale activities at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  
 Certain derivative contracts are part of Select Energy's wholesale activities that the company is in the process of exiting.  These contracts also include other wholesale and retail short-term and long-term electricity supply and sales contracts, which include contracts to sell electricity to utilities under full requirements contracts and contracts to sell electricity to municipalities with terms up to eight remaining years.  The fair value of the natural gas contracts was primarily determined by prices provided by external sources and actively quoted markets.  The fair value of electricity contracts was determined by prices from external sources for years through 2008 and by models based on natural gas prices and a heat-rate conversion factor to electricity for subsequent periods.  In addition, to gather market intelligence and utilize this information in risk management activities for the wholes ale marketing activities, Select Energy conducted limited energy trading activities in electricity, natural gas, and oil, and therefore, experienced net open positions.  Select Energy manages open trading positions with strict policies that limit its exposure to market risk and require daily reporting to management of potential financial exposures.   
NU Enterprises - Wholesale:
Derivatives used in wholesale activities are recorded at fair value and included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets or liabilities.  Changes in fair value are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income in the period of change.  The net fair value position of the wholesale portfolio at June 30, 2005 was a liability of $250 million.    
 Select Energy manages its portfolio of retail marketing contracts to maximize value while operating within NU's corporate risk tolerance.  Select Energy generally acquires retail customers in smaller increments than it acquired wholesale customers, which while requiring careful sourcing, allows energy purchases to be acquired in smaller increments with lower risk.  However, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
NU Enterprises - Retail:
From time to time, the retail marketing business line is required to enter into contracts that cannot immediately receive accrual accounting and therefore, changes in fair value are required to be marked-to-market via the income statement.  
Derivatives used in retail activities are recorded at fair value and included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets or liabilities.  Changes in fair value are recognized in fuel, purchased and net interchange power in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income in the period of change.  The net fair value position of the retail portfolio at June 30, 2005 was an asset of $21.2 million.    
Select Energy's retail portfolio includes New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures, financial swaps, and options, the fair value of which is based on closing exchange prices; over-the-counter forwards, and financial swaps, the fair value of which is based on the mid-point of bid and ask market prices; and bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, the fair value of which is determined using available information from external sources, financial transmission rights and transmission congestion contracts, the fair value of which is based on historical settlement prices as well as external sources.
 Select Energy utilizes derivative financial and commodity instruments, including futures and forward contracts, to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity and natural gas purchased to meet firm sales and purchase commitments to certain retail customers.  Select Energy also utilizes derivatives, including price swap agreements, call and put option contracts, and futures and forward contracts to manage the market risk associated with a portion of its anticipated supply and delivery requirements.  These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments and are used to reduce the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of electricity or natural gas.  A derivative that hedges exposure to the variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (a cash flow hedge) is initially recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated o ther comprehensive income.  Cash flow hedges impact net income when the forecasted transaction being hedged occurs, when hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recorded, when the forecasted transaction being hedged is no longer probable of occurring, or when there is accumulated other comprehensive loss and the hedge and the forecasted transaction being hedged are in a loss position on a combined basis.   
NU Enterprises - Hedging:
Select Energy maintains natural gas service agreements with certain customers to supply gas at fixed prices for terms extending through 2010.  Select Energy has hedged its gas supply risk under these agreements through NYMEX futures contracts.  Under these contracts, which also extend through 2010, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements.  At June 30, 2005 the NYMEX futures contracts had notional values of $44.9 million and were recorded at fair value as derivative assets totaling $6.4 million and derivative liabilities of a negative $0.4 million.   
Select Energy also maintains various physical and financial instruments to hedge its electric and gas purchases and sales through 2006. These instruments include forwards, futures, options, financial collars, financial transmission rights and swaps. These hedging contracts, which are valued at the mid-point of bid and ask market prices, were recorded as derivative assets of $4 million and derivative liabilities of $6 million at June 30, 2005.   
Select Energy hedges certain amounts of natural gas inventory with gas futures, options and swaps, some of which are accounted for as fair value hedges.  Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and natural gas inventory are recorded in earnings.  The change in fair value of the futures, options and swaps were included in derivative liabilities and amounted to $0.7 million at June 30, 2005.  The change in fair value of the hedged natural gas inventory was recorded as a reduction to fuel, materials and supplies of $37,000 at June 30, 2005.   
The table below summarizes current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004.  Prior to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business, these current and long-term derivative assets and liabilities were classified as trading, non-trading and hedging derivative assets and liabilities.
 Yankee Gas maintains a master swap agreement with a financial counterparty to purchase gas at fixed prices.  Under this master swap agreement, the purchase price of a specified quantity of gas for an unaffiliated customer is effectively fixed over the term of the gas service agreements with that customer for a period not extending beyond 2005.  At June 30, 2005 the commodity swap agreement had a notional value of $0.3 million and was recorded at fair value as a derivative asset of $0.3 million. The firm commitment contract that is hedged is also recorded as a liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair values of the hedge and firm commitment have offsetting impacts in earnings.
Utility Group - Gas - Hedging:
In May 2005, Yankee Gas entered into an interest rate lock to hedge the interest cash outflows associated with its proposed $50 million July 2005 debt issuance.  Under the cash flow hedge, Yankee Gas intended to lock the treasury rate that would be realized on its planned debt issuance.  The interest rate lock is based on a United States government 30-year treasury rate and matches the index used for the debt issuance.  As a cash flow hedge at June 30, 2005, the change in fair value of the lock is recorded as a $1.8 million derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting amount included in other comprehensive income.
 CL&P has two independent power producer (IPP) contracts to purchase power that contain pricing provisions that are not clearly and closely related to the price of power and therefore do not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception.  The fair values of these IPP non-trading derivatives at June 30, 2005 include a derivative asset with a fair value of $278.9 million and a derivative liability with a fair value of $41.2 million.  An offsetting regulatory liability and an offsetting regulatory asset were recorded, as these contracts are part of the stranded costs, and management believes that these costs will continue to be recovered or refunded in rates.   
Utility Group - Electric - Non-Trading:
 In March of 2003, NU parent entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on its $263 million, 7.25 percent fixed rate note that matures on April 1, 2012.  As a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the swap and the hedged debt instrument are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets but are offsetting in the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.  At June 30, 2005, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged debt of $3.8 million is included as a decrease to long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The hedge is recorded as a derivative asset of $3.8 million. The resulting changes in interest payments made are recorded as adjustments to interest expense.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Yankee Gas, NU Enterprises)
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives be reviewed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test.  NU uses October 1st as the annual goodwill impairment testing date.  Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.
NU's reporting units that maintain goodwill are generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 11, "Segment Information," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Consistent with the way management reviews the operating results of its reporting units, NU's reporting unit under the NU Enterprises reportable segment that maintains goodwill is the merchant energy reporting unit.  The merchant energy reporting unit is comprised of the operations of Select Energy, Northeast Generation Company (NGC), the generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP), and Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS).  As a result, NU's reporting units that maintain goodwill are as follows: the Yankee Gas reporting unit, which is classified under the Utility Group - gas reportable segment, and the merchant energy reporting unit, which is classified under the NU Enterprises - merchant energy reportable segment.  The goodwill balances of these reporting units are included in the table herein.
A summary of NU's goodwill balances at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, by reportable segment and reporting units is as follows:
On March 9, 2005, NU announced that it had completed its comprehensive review of the NU Enterprises businesses.  During this review, certain goodwill balances and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, and adjustments were recorded in the first quarter of 2005 to write these assets off.  The goodwill balance in the NU Enterprises energy services reporting unit was determined to be impaired in its entirety, and a $29.1 million write-off was recorded.  Energy services intangible assets not subject to amortization were also impaired, and an $8.5 million pre-tax write-off was recorded while an additional $0.7 million pre-tax of other intangible assets were impaired.  At June 30, 2005, NU's remaining intangible assets totaled $2.6 million.  This amount will be amortized $0.6 million for the remainder of 2005, $1 million in 2006, and $1 million in 2007.  
The exclusivity agreement intangible asset, which was included in the merchant energy business, was also written off.  The $7.9 million balance at December 31, 2004 was amortized by $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2005 and the remaining $7.2 million was written off.  
For information regarding the completion of the comprehensive review and these asset impairments, see Note 3, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Assets Held for Sale," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
There were no impairments or adjustments to the goodwill balances during the second quarter of 2005 or the first six months of 2004.  
The goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of Yankee Gas is not being recovered from the customers of Yankee Gas.
 
NU recorded amortization expense of $0.2 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and amortization expense of $1.1 million and $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to intangible assets subject to amortization.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A.
Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters (CL&P, PSNH, WMECO)
Connecticut:
: The Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and independent power producer (IPP) over market costs, while the System Benefits Charge (SBC) allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.   
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2005, CL&P filed its 2004 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which compared CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, total CTA revenues exceeded the CTA revenue requirements by $14.1 million.  This amount was recorded as a regulatory liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  For the same period, SBC revenues exceeded the SBC revenue requirement by $3.6 million which was recorded as a regulatory liability.  Management expects a decision in this docket from the DPUC by the end of 2005.  
In the 2001 CTA and SBC reconciliation filing, and subsequently in a September 10, 2002 petition to reopen related proceedings, CL&P requested that a deferred intercompany tax liability associated with the intercompany sale of generation assets be excluded from the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  This liability is currently included as a reduction in the calculation of CTA revenue requirements.  On September 10, 2003, the DPUC issued a final decision denying CL&P's request, and on October 24, 2003, CL&P appealed the DPUC's final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court.  The appeal has been fully briefed and argued.  If CL&P's request is granted and upheld through these court proceedings, there would be additional amounts due to CL&P from its customers.  The amount due is contingent upon the findings of the court, however, management believes that CL&P's pre-tax earnings would increase by a minimum of $17 million in 2005.   
New Hampshire:
The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs.  On an annual basis, PSNH files with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year.  This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues and costs and transition energy service/default energy service (TS/DS) revenues and costs.  The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of the operation of PSNH's generation assets.  The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $227.4 million at June 30, 2005.  This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of non-securitized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $386.7 million to $159.3 million
SCRC Reconciliation Filing:  
.
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on May 2, 2005.  The NHPUC has scheduled a hearing in late October 2005.  Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis.  PSNH has included a request, and supporting testimony, to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process in its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation filing.  This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting.  At June 30, 2005, PSNH's unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs.  Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
 The New Hampshire legislature will be considering a bill in its 2006 legislative session that would place strict limitations on the level of mercury that PSNH's existing generation plants can emit.  This bill was first proposed in the 2005 session, but was subsequently set aside and retained for the 2006 session.  Management has been reviewing the proposed legislation and assessing how PSNH might meet any required reduction in mercury emissions should such strict limitations be established.  PSNH's alternatives range from the installation of additional pollution control equipment, reducing operating capacity of its plants and possible retirement of one or more of its generating units.  PSNH conducted testing of one control technology at its Merrimack Station during the summer of 2005.  While state law and PSNH's restructuring agreement provide for the recovery of its generation costs, including the cost to comply with state environmental regulations, at this time management is unable to determine the impact of any potential new legislation on PSNH's net income or financial position.
Environmental Legislation:
  
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2005, WMECO filed its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE).  The DTE has combined the 2003 and 2004 transition cost reconciliation filings, the standard offer service and default service reconciliations, and the transmission cost adjustment filings into a single proceeding.  The timing of a decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, but management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.
Transition Cost Reconciliation and Other Filings:
B.
NRG Energy, Inc. Exposures (CL&P, Yankee Gas)
Certain subsidiaries of NU, including CL&P and Yankee Gas, entered into transactions with NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) and certain of its subsidiaries.  On May 14, 2003, NRG and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions.  On December 5, 2003, NRG emerged from bankruptcy.  NU's NRG-related exposures as a result of these transactions relate to 1) the recovery of congestion charges incurred by NRG prior to the implementation of standard market design on March 1, 2003, 2) the recovery of CL&P's station service billings from NRG, and 3) the recovery of Yankee Gas' and CL&P's expenditures that were incurred related to an NRG subsidiary's generating plant construction project that has ceased.  While it is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these issues, management does not expect that their resolution will have a material adverse effect on NU's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.< B>
C.
Long-Term Contractual Arrangements (CL&P, PSNH, Merchant Energy)
These amounts represent commitments for various services and materials primarily associated with the Bethel, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut and the Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut projects as of June 30, 2005.  For further information regarding these projects, see the "Business Development and Capital Expenditures" section included in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of this combined report on Form 10-Q.
CL&P:  
 PSNH has a contract for capacity on the Portland Natural Gas Transmission System (PNGTS) pipeline which extends through 2018.  Estimate future annual costs under this contract are as follows:
PSNH:
Select Energy maintains off-balance sheet long-term agreements to purchase energy as part of its portfolio of resources to meet its actual or expected sales commitments.  These sale commitments are accounted for on the accrual basis.  The aggregate amount of these purchase contracts was $824 million at June 30, 2005, as follows (millions of dollars):
Merchant Energy:   
Select Energy's purchase contract amounts can exceed the amount expected to be reported in fuel, purchased and net interchange power.
Select Energy maintains certain wholesale energy commitments whose mark-to-market values have been recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as derivative assets and liabilities.  The aggregate amount of these purchase contracts was $4.2 billion at June 30, 2005, the majority of which settle in 2005 and 2006.
In March 2005, HWP notified Massachusetts environmental regulators that it planned to install a selective catalytic reduction system at the 147 megawatt Mt. Tom coal-fired station in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The $14 million project commenced in July 2005 and is expected to be complete by mid-2006.  The following amounts represent commitments for various services and materials associated with this project:
In July 2005, HWP entered into a $50.4 million contract to purchase coal to fuel the Mt. Tom coal-fired station in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  Estimated future obligations under this contract will commence in 2006 are as follows:

Deferred Contractual Obligations (NU, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO)
 In 2003, CYAPC increased the estimated decommissioning and plant closure costs for the period 2000 through 2023 by approximately $395 million over the April 2000 estimate of $436 million approved by the FERC in a 2000 rate case settlement.  The revised estimate reflects the increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage, increased security and liability and property insurance costs, and the fact that CYAPC is now self performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel in July 2003.  NU's share of CYAPC's increase in decommissioning and plant closure costs is approximately $194 million.  On July 1, 2004, CYAPC filed with the FERC for recovery of these increased costs.  In the filing, CYAPC sought to increase its annual decommissioning collections from $16.7 million to $93 million for a six-year period beginning on Januar y 1, 2005.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC issued an order accepting the rates, with collection beginning on February 1, 2005, subject to refund.
FERC Proceedings:
Both the DPUC and Bechtel filed testimony in the FERC proceeding claiming that CYAPC was imprudent in its management of the decommissioning project.  The DPUC has claimed that CYAPC did not terminate the contract with Bechtel soon enough, and Bechtel has claimed that CYAPC terminated the contract too soon.  In its testimony, the DPUC recommended a disallowance of $225 million to $234 million out of CYAPC's requested rate increase of approximately $395 million.  NU's share of the DPUC's recommended disallowance is between $110 million to $115 million.  The FERC staff also filed testimony that did not take a position on prudence but recommended a $36 million decrease in the requested rate increase claiming that CYAPC should have used a different gross domestic product (GDP) escalator.  NU's share of this recommended decrease is $17.6 million.  Management expects that if the FERC staff's position on the decommissioning GDP cost esc alator is found by the FERC to be more appropriate than that used by CYAPC to develop its proposed rates, then CYAPC would review whether to reduce its estimated decommissioning obligation and reduce the customers' obligation, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  Hearings in this proceeding began on June 1, 2005 and have concluded.  A post-trial briefing schedule has been set, and a FERC administrative law judge decision in this proceeding is scheduled to be rendered in December 2005.
The company cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding required for the collection of the increased CYAPC decommissioning costs.  The company believes that the costs have been prudently incurred and will ultimately be recovered from the customers of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  However, there is a risk that some portion of these increased costs may not be recovered, or will have to be refunded if recovered, as a result of the FERC proceedings.  
On June 10, 2004, the DPUC and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) filed a petition seeking a declaratory order that CYAPC be allowed to recover all decommissioning costs from its wholesale purchasers, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, but that such purchasers may not be allowed to recover in their retail rates any costs that the FERC might determine to have been imprudently incurred.  On August 30, 2004, the FERC denied this petition.  On September 29, 2004, the DPUC and OCC asked the FERC to reconsider the petition.  On October 29, 2004, the FERC issued an order granting further consideration regarding the DPUC's and OCC's petition for reconsideration.  No date has been established for this reconsideration.
 
 CYAPC is currently in litigation with Bechtel in Connecticut Superior Court (the Court) over the termination of its decommissioning contract.  On June 13, 2003, CYAPC gave notice of the termination of its contract with Bechtel for the decommissioning of its nuclear power plant.  CYAPC terminated the contract due to Bechtel's incomplete and untimely performance and refusal to perform the remaining decommissioning work.  Bechtel has departed the site and the decommissioning responsibility has been transitioned to CYAPC, which has recommenced the decommissioning process.
Bechtel Litigation:
On June 23, 2003, Bechtel filed a complaint against CYAPC asserting a number of claims and seeking a variety of remedies, including monetary and punitive damages and rescission of the contract.  Bechtel has since amended its complaint to add claims for wrongful termination.  On August 22, 2003, CYAPC filed its answer and counterclaims, including counts for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing.  The parties are proceeding with depositions in the case.  Bechtel filed an offer of judgment for CYAPC to pay Bechtel the amount of $20 million, which was rejected by CYAPC.  CYAPC filed an offer of judgment for Bechtel to pay the amount of $65 million to CYAPC, which was rejected by Bechtel.  If either party prevails in litigation with an award equal to or higher than its offer, then the Court will add 12 percent annual interest to the award to the prevailing party, computed fr om the date of the party's claim (from June 23, 2003 for Bechtel or August 22, 2003 for CYAPC).  A trial has been scheduled for spring of 2006.  
In the prejudgment remedy proceeding before the Court, Bechtel sought garnishment of the CYAPC decommissioning trust and related payments.  In October 2004, Bechtel and CYAPC entered into an agreement under which Bechtel waived its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYAPC's real property in Connecticut and the escrowing of $41.7 million the sponsors are scheduled to pay to CYAPC through June 30, 2007 in respect to CYAPC's common equity.  This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be implemented until the Court found
that such assets were subject to attachment.  CYAPC has contested the attachability of such assets.  The DPUC is an intervenor in this proceeding.  NU cannot predict the timing and the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
 CYAPC, Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (MYAPC) (collectively, the Yankee Companies) also commenced litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983 under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Act).  Under the Act, the DOE was to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear plants of the Yankee Companies no later than January 31, 1998 in return for payments by each company into the nuclear waste fund.  No fuel has been collected by the DOE, and spent nuclear fuel is stored on the sites of the Yankee Companies' plants.  The Yankee Companies collected the funds for payments into the nuclear waste fund from wholesale utility customers under FERC-approved contract rates.  The wholesale utility customers in turn collect these payments from their retail electric customers.  The Yankee Companies' individual damage claims attributed to the government's breach totaling $548 million are specific to each plant and include incremental storage, security, construction and other costs through 2010.  The CYAPC damage claim is $197 million, the YAEC damage claim is $191 million and the MYAPC damage claim is $160 million.
Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation:
The DOE trial ended on August 31, 2004 and a verdict has not been reached.  The current Yankee Companies' rates do not include an amount for recovery of damages in this matter.  Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
E.
Consolidated Edison, Inc. Merger Litigation
Certain gain and loss contingencies continue to exist with regard to the 1999 merger agreement between NU and Consolidated Edison, Inc. and the related litigation.  At this stage of the litigation, management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate effect on NU.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The following is a summary of NU's available-for-sale securities related to NU's SERP securities and NU's investment in Globix Corporation (Globix), which are included in deferred debits and other assets - other on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and WMECO's prior spent nuclear fuel trust:  
(a)
At December 31, 2004, NU's investment in NEON was not a marketable equity security.  On March 8, 2005, NEON merged with Globix, and NU's investment in Globix became a marketable equity security at that time.    
At June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, NU has evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position and has determined that none of the related unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary in nature.
For information related to the change in net unrealized holding gains and losses included in shareholders' equity, see Note 8, "Comprehensive Income," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, realized gains and losses recognized on the sale of available-for-sale securities are as follows (in millions):
NU utilizes the specific identification basis method for the Globix and SERP securities and the average cost basis method for the WMECO prior spent nuclear fuel trust to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities.
Proceeds from the sale of these securities totaled $17.6 million and $4.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $30.5 million and $6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

These amounts relate to unrealized gains on investments in marketable debt and equity securities and minimum pension liability adjustments, net of related income taxes.
9.
EARNINGS PER SHARE (NU)
EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect if certain securities are converted into common stock.  At June 30, 2005 and 2004, 1,255,929 options and 626,302 options, respectively, were excluded from the following table as these options were antidilutive.  The following table sets forth the components of basic and fully diluted EPS:
10.
PENSION BENEFITS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (All Companies)
NU's subsidiaries participate in a uniform noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (Pension Plan) covering the majority of regular NU employees and also provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits through a benefit plan to retired employees (PBOP Plan).  The components of net periodic benefit expense for the Pension Plan and the PBOP Plan for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 are estimated as follows:
A portion of these amounts is capitalized related to current employees working on capital projects.  Amounts capitalized were $2.3 million and $4.7 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, and $0.7 million and $1.4 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively.  
NU does not currently expect to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2005.  NU contributed and anticipates contributing approximately $12.6 million quarterly totaling approximately $50 million in 2005 to fund its PBOP Plan.  
11.
SEGMENT INFORMATION (All Companies)
NU is organized between the Utility Group and NU Enterprises businesses based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each business' products and services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which they operate.  Effective January 1, 2005, the portion of NGS' business that supports NGC's and HWP's generation assets has been reclassified from the services and other segment to the merchant energy segment within the NU Enterprises segment.  Segment information for all periods presented has been restated to conform to the current presentation.  
The Utility Group segment, including both the regulated electric distribution and transmission businesses, as well as the gas distribution business comprised of Yankee Gas, represents approximately 70 percent of NU's total revenues for both the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and includes the operations of the regulated electric utilities, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, whose complete condensed consolidated financial statements are included in NU's original combined report on Form 10-Q.  PSNH's distribution segment includes generation activities.  Also included in this combined report on Form 10-Q is detailed information regarding CL&P's, PSNH's, and WMECO's transmission businesses.  Utility Group revenues from the sale of electricity and natural gas primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer.
The NU Enterprises merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy, NGC, NGS, and the generation operations of HWP, while the NU Enterprises services and other business segment includes E. S. Boulos Company, Woods Electrical, and NGS Mechanical, Inc., which are subsidiaries of NGS, SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc., and HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC, Woods Network, and intercompany eliminations.  The results of NU Enterprises parent are also included within services and other.  For further information regarding NU Enterprises' merchant energy business and services businesses, see Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes" and Note 3, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Assets Held for Sale," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  In the first quarter of 2005, the decision was made to exit the wholesale marketing business and the energy services businesses.  NU Enterpr ises is retaining its retail marketing and merchant generation businesses.  
NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  For further information regarding these companies, see Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
There were no CL&P transitional standard offer (TSO) purchases from Select Energy for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  Total Select Energy revenues from CL&P for other transactions with CL&P, represented $12.5 million and $26.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005.  Effective January 1, 2004, Select Energy began serving a portion of CL&P's TSO load for 2004.  Total Select Energy revenues from CL&P for CL&P's TSO load and for other transactions with CL&P, represented $136 million or 23 percent and $314.5 million or 24 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively, of total NU Enterprises' revenues.  Total CL&P purchases from Select Energy are eliminated in consolidation.
WMECO's purchases from Select Energy for standard offer and default service and for other transactions with Select Energy represented $17.4 million and $37.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, and $21 million and $53 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively.

Revenues related to New Jersey Basic Generation Service represented $73.5 million and $143.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005.  No other individual customer represented in excess of 10 percent of NU Enterprises' revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 or 2004.  
Due to merchant energy's decision to exit the wholesale business, all wholesale revenues, including intercompany revenues, have been included in fuel, purchased and net interchange power beginning in the second quarter of 2005.
Other in the NU consolidated tables includes the results for Mode 1 Communications, Inc., an investor in Globix, the results of the non-energy-related subsidiaries of Yankee (Yankee Energy Services Company, Yankee Energy Financial Services Company, and NorConn Properties, Inc.), the non-energy operations of HWP, and the results of NU's parent and service companies.  Interest expense included in other primarily relates to the debt of NU parent.  
NU's segment information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (some amounts between the financial statements and between segment schedules may not agree due to rounding):
(1)
Includes PSNH's generation activities.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  As a result, NU's condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 included in this report on Form 10-Q also present the operations for SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical as discontinued operations.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the loss from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for all prior periods.  Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as follows.  
Included in discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 are $4.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of intercompany revenues that are not eliminated in consolidation due to the separate presentation of discontinued operations.  For the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 these amounts were $8.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively.  NU does not expect that after the disposal it will have significant ongoing involvement or continuing cash flows with the entities presented in discontinued operations.
NU's condensed consolidated balance sheets were not impacted by this revision.  At September 30, 2005, the assets and liabilities of these companies totaled $136.2 million and $118.4 million, respectively, as those amounts are not significantly different than those reported on the balance sheets included herein.
On November 7, 2005, NU announced, as disclosed in its third quarter 2005 report on Form 10-Q, it would exit the remainder of its merchant energy business segment, which includes the retail marketing business and the competitive generation business.  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Northeast Utilities
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Northeast Utilities and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of June 30, 2005, and the related condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, and of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.  These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.  It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2, the Company's competitive business subsidiary, NU Enterprises, Inc., recorded significant charges in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2005 in connection with its decision to exit certain business lines.  
As discussed in Notes 1A and 12, the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to reflect certain components of the Company's energy services businesses as discontinued operations.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of capitalization of Northeast Utilities and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 16, 2005 (November 22, 2005 as to Notes 1B, 1H, 1V, 13, 15 and 17), we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes in this Form 10-Q, the First Quarter 2005 Form 10-Q, the NU 2004 Form 10-K, and the current reports on Form 8-K disclosed in Part II, Item 6, "Other Information - Exhibits and Reports on Form 8-K," included in NU's original report on Form 10-Q.  All per share amounts are reported on a fully diluted basis.
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
The following items in this executive summary are explained in this report on Form 10-Q:
Strategy, Results and Outlook:
Northeast Utilities (NU or the company) continues to make significant progress toward the strategic direction announced in March 2005.  Progress in the second quarter of 2005 included the continued deployment of significant capital into the company's regulated transmission and distribution infrastructure and the completion of several steps in the exit from the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses.  NU's second quarter results reflect that progress, but were negatively impacted by the effect of increasing market prices on the wholesale electricity contracts the company is seeking to divest.
NU reported a consolidated loss of $27.7 million, or $0.21 per share in the second quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $24 million, or $0.19 per share, in the same period of 2004.  For the first half of 2005, NU lost $145.4 million, or $1.12 per share, compared with earnings of $91.4 million, or $0.71 per share, in the first half of 2004.  The lower results were due primarily to charges at NU Enterprises related to the decision to exit the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses.
NU Enterprises lost $47.1 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $4 million in the second quarter of 2004.  NU Enterprises lost $214.5 million in the first half of 2005, compared with earnings of $22.8 million in the first half of 2004.  NU Enterprises continues to work toward the goal of exiting the wholesale marketing business and completing the divestiture of its energy services businesses by the end of 2005.  During the second quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises solicited bids from firms that wanted to purchase all or a large portion of the wholesale portfolio of contracts.  NU Enterprises has reached agreements to settle 6 of its 15 long-dated contract obligations.  NU Enterprises is also in the process of receiving and analyzing bids for several of its energy services businesses.
The Utility Group earned $22.1 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $27.1 million in the second quarter of 2004.  The Utility Group earned $75.6 million in the first half of 2005, compared with $80.5 million in the first half of 2004.  Lower earnings are primarily due to a $4.4 million charge at The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) related to an adverse regulatory decision related to prior year streetlight billings.
NU projects Utility Group earnings of between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005 and parent and other costs of between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005.  The regulated earnings range reflects between $0.96 per share and $1.00 per share at the regulated distribution and generation businesses and between $0.26 per share and $0.30 per share at the regulated transmission business.  The company is not providing 2005 earnings guidance for its NU Enterprises businesses.
Legislative and Regulatory Items:
On August 8, 2005, President Bush is expected to sign comprehensive federal energy legislation repealing the 1935 Act and adopting provisions designed to facilitate the construction of natural gas and electric transmission facilities.
On July 6, 2005, Connecticut Governor Rell signed legislation creating a mechanism to allow regulators to periodically true-up  the retail transmission charge in distribution company rates based on changes in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-approved charges.  This mechanism will allow CL&P to promptly recover its transmission expenditures.
On July 22, 2005, Governor Rell signed a bill which provides local electric distribution companies, including CL&P, with financial incentives to promote distributed generation and also provides distribution companies with the possibility of owning generation on a limited basis.  The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) will be conducting numerous proceedings to implement the bill.  
In May 2005, the DPUC approved an interim 4.8 percent increase in CL&P rates by raising the Federally Mandated Congestion Cost (FMCC) charges on customer bills to approximately 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) from approximately 1.2 cents per kWh.  On July 29, 2005, the DPUC issued a draft decision that supports the interim rate increase approved in May 2005 and a final decision is expected by the end of August 2005.  The increase is due to new reliability must run (RMR) contracts filed at the FERC by generators in Connecticut.
On June 8, 2005, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) issued an order lowering the return on equity (ROE) on Public Service Company of New Hampshire's (PSNH) generating facilities to 9.63 percent from 11 percent, effective July 1, 2005.  On July 7, 2005, PSNH asked the NHPUC to reconsider its decision.  
On June 15, 2005, a FERC administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision concerning the implementation of Locational Installed Capacity (LICAP) in New England.  The ALJ largely adopted the demand curve as filed by the New England Independent System Operator (ISO-NE).  On July 15, 2005, ISO-NE filed a motion with the FERC requesting a FERC decision no later than September 15, 2005 to allow for implementation by January 1, 2006.  
On June 30, 2005, the DPUC issued a final decision in CL&P's streetlighting docket.  As a result of this decision, CL&P recorded a $4.4 million after-tax charge for streetlight billing in the second quarter of 2005.
On July 1, 2005, after a review of its transition energy service/default energy service (TS/DS) costs, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting an increase in the TS/DS rate from the current $0.0649 per kWh to $0.0734 per kWh based on actual costs and underrecoveries incurred to date and updated cost projections.  The updated cost projections include an increase in costs as a direct result of higher fuel and purchased power costs that PSNH expects to incur.  An order changing the TS/DS rate to $0.0724 per kWh, effective August 1, 2005 was issued by the NHPUC on August 1, 2005.  
In May 2005, a FERC ALJ issued an initial decision concerning the ROE allowed New England electric transmission owners, including NU.  The decision endorsed a base ROE of 10.72 percent plus another 0.50 percent for regional transmission facilities.  The ALJ deferred to the FERC final resolution on an additional 100 basis point adder for all new transmission investments.  A final FERC decision is expected in late 2005.
Liquidity:
Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas) sold $50 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds in July 2005.  Proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings incurred to finance capital expenditures.
Cash flows from operations decreased by $217 million to $276.9 million for the first half of 2005 from $493.9 million for the first half of 2004.  This decrease in cash flows from operations is primarily the result of higher regulatory refunds as CL&P refunds amounts to its ratepayers for past overcollections.
Overview
NU lost $27.7 million, or $0.21 per share, in the second quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $24 million, or $0.19 per share, in the second quarter of 2004.  NU lost $145.4 million, or $1.12 per share, in the first half of 2005, compared with earnings of $91.4 million, or $0.71 per share, in the first half of 2004.  A summary of NU's earnings/(losses) by major business line for the second quarter and first half of 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
Consolidated:  
(1)
The NU Enterprises losses include losses totaling $1.7 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.  For the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, these amounts were $18.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively.  
The 2005 NU losses were due to the company's decision for NU Enterprises to exit the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses.  In the second quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises recorded an after-tax mark-to-market charge of $44.2 million ($69.6 million pre-tax) associated with certain wholesale electric contracts it is seeking to divest and $1.4 million of after-tax ($2.3 million pre-tax) restructuring and impairment charges.  
Losses in the first half of 2005 were primarily the result of $195.7 million of after-tax ($306.3 million pre-tax) wholesale contract market changes and restructuring and impairment charges at NU Enterprises associated with the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses.  
Excluding the wholesale contract market changes and the restructuring and impairment charges described above, NU Enterprises lost $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2005 and lost $18.8 million in the first half of 2005, compared with earnings of $4 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $22.8 million in the first half of 2004.  
For information regarding these charges, see Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes," and Note 3, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Assets Held for Sale," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Utility Group is comprised of CL&P, PSNH, Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), and Yankee Gas, including their transmission, distribution and generation businesses.  After payment of preferred dividends, earnings at the Utility Group decreased by $5 million to $22.1 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $27.1 million in 2004.  Utility Group earnings totaled $75.6 million in the first half of 2005 compared with $80.5 million in the first half of 2004 as retail rate increases at all four regulated companies were offset by an after-tax charge of $4.4 million related to a final regulatory decision concerning refunds to streetlighting customers, higher pension, depreciation, and interest expense, and the absence of certain positive adjustments that had been reflected in 2004 earnings.  Retail electric and firm gas sales in the second quarter of 2005 were approximately 1 percent and 3 perc ent higher than the second quarter of 2004, respectively.  On a year-to-date basis, 2005 retail electric sales were approximately the same as last year and firm gas sales decreased by 0.8 percent.  On a weather normalized basis, both 2005 electric and firm gas sales were approximately 1.5 percent lower than 2004.  A summary of Utility Group earnings by company for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
Utility Group:  
*After preferred dividends.
CL&P's second quarter and first half 2005 distribution results were lower due primarily to an after-tax charge of $4.4 million related to a final regulatory decision concerning refunds to streetlighting customers along with higher transmission costs which were not automatically passed on to CL&P's retail customers.  A $25 million distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2005 was offset by higher depreciation, interest, and pension expense.  CL&P transmission earnings were higher due to a higher transmission rate base and higher earnings related to the allowance for funds used during construction.
PSNH second quarter 2005 distribution and generation earnings increased as compared to the same period of 2004 due to higher rates and higher residential and commercial sales, partially offset by higher operating costs.  As a result of a settlement agreement approved by the NHPUC in 2004, PSNH implemented energy delivery rate increases of $3.5 million annually effective October 1, 2004 and $10 million annually, effective June 1, 2005.  PSNH transmission earnings for the second quarter and first half 2005 were higher due to a higher transmission rate base.
The distribution earnings for CL&P and PSNH are also lower in 2005 as a result of certain retail transmission expenses that were charged to the distribution businesses but not included in the retail transmission rates that were charged to customers.  There is no impact to earnings for the Utility Group; however, because the transmission earnings for CL&P and PSNH increased by a commensurate amount.  With the enactment of the new Connecticut legislation, CL&P will be able to recover future increases in its retail transmission expenses and as a result, the Utility Group earnings will increase.  WMECO already has similar ratemaking treatment for its retail transmission expenses, but PSNH does not.  
WMECO second quarter and first half 2005 distribution results reflect a $6 million annualized distribution rate increase that took effect on January 1, 2005 which was offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income.  WMECO's 2005 transmission earnings have been comparable to those of 2004 as a result of a stable rate base.
Yankee Gas' second quarter 2005 results were lower than in 2004 primarily due to the absence of a positive tax adjustment which occurred in the second quarter of 2004.  Year-to-date earnings were $2.4 million higher in 2005 due to a $14 million annualized rate increase that took effect on January 1, 2005.  
NU Enterprises is the parent of Northeast Generation Company (NGC), Northeast Generation Services Company (NGS), Select Energy, Inc. (Select Energy), SESI and its subsidiaries, SECI, Reeds Ferry, and Woods Network, all of which are collectively referred to as "NU Enterprises."  The generation operations of Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) are also included in the results of NU Enterprises.  The companies included in the NU Enterprises segment are grouped into two business segments:  the merchant energy segment and the energy services segment.  Included in the merchant energy business segment is Select Energy's wholesale marketing business, which NU Enterprises is exiting.  The merchant energy segment will include 1,296 megawatts (MW) of primarily pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets owned by NGC, 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets owned by HWP, Select Energy's retail business and NGS.  The energy services
NU Enterprises:  
businesses being divested consist of the E.S. Boulos Company, Woods Electrical, which are subsidiaries of NGS, SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, HEC/Tobyhanna Energy Project, Inc., HEC/CJTS Energy Center LLC, and Woods Network.  These businesses will be divested in a manner that maximizes their values.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.  
NU Enterprises lost $47.1 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $214.5 million in the first half of 2005, compared with earnings of $4 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $22.8 million in the first half of 2004.  A summary of NU Enterprises' (losses)/earnings by business for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:
(1)
The energy services, parent and other losses include losses totaling $1.7 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are classified as discontinued operations.  For the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, these amounts were $18.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively.  
In the second quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises recorded an after-tax mark-to-market charge of $44.2 million ($69.6 million pre-tax) associated with certain wholesale electric contracts it is seeking to divest and $1.4 million of after-tax ($2.3 million pre-tax) restructuring and impairment charges.  The mark-to-market charge reflects increases in electricity prices in the forward markets over the next several years, which reduced the mark-to-market value of certain wholesale electric contracts.  NU Enterprises is seeking to divest those contracts and will continue to mark them to market until they are divested or expire.  If wholesale electric prices continue to fluctuate, those price movements will have an impact on NU Enterprises' earnings.  
Losses in the first half of 2005 were primarily the result of $195.7 million of after-tax ($306.3 million pre-tax) wholesale contract market changes and restructuring and impairment charges at NU Enterprises associated with the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses.  Losses in the first half of 2005 also include a negative after-tax mark-to-market change of $25.7 million ($40.7 million pre-tax) on certain wholesale natural gas contracts signed in 2004 to economically hedge Select Energy's wholesale electricity contracts for 2005 and 2006 that were used in Select Energy's energy sourcing activities.  These positions were balanced by entering into offsetting positions in the first quarter of 2005 and had no impact on the second quarter nor will they have an impact on future earnings.  Losses in the first half of 2005 also include a positive after-tax impact relating to trading contracts total ing $16.4 million ($25.8 million pre-tax) in the first half of 2005.  
A portion of these impairment charges totaling $0.1 million after-tax ($0.2 million pre-tax) and $14.7 million after-tax ($24.2 million pre-tax) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, is included in the loss from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income as the charges relate to services companies that are presented as discontinued operations.  
Excluding the mark-to-market and restructuring and impairment charges, the merchant energy segment lost $12.8 million for the first half of 2005.  Retail marketing lost $3.5 million in the first half of 2005.  This loss was primarily the result of a requirement to account for the sourcing of its customers' electric requirements at March 31, 2005 market prices for supply contracts signed in the past at lower prices.  This was necessitated by the fact that the source of those contracts, wholesale marketing, is being divested, which in turn required these contracts to move from accrual accounting to mark-to-market accounting.  As a result, an after-tax gain on those retail contracts of $59.9 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2005 that represented future margins on existing retail transactions.  These contracts are being divested, while the sales contracts are being retained and remain on accrual accounting.  Fu ture quarterly retail energy marketing business results will be negatively affected by this accounting treatment.  Excluding that impact, which was $6.3 million after-tax, the retail energy marketing business earned $2.8 million for the first six months of 2005.  Retail marketing remains on target to earn the $6 million projected for 2005, compared with approximately $5 million in 2004, excluding the impact of this accounting treatment.  This after-tax negative impact is expected to be approximately $17 million for the third quarter of 2005, $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, approximately $20 million for 2006, approximately $11 million for 2007, and approximately $3 million in 2008.  
The remainder of the merchant energy segment, which includes merchant generation and wholesale marketing, lost $9.2 million for the first half of 2005.  Losses are expected to continue through 2005 because the discontinuance of wholesale marketing activities and the marking-to-market of wholesale contracts significantly reduced future wholesale gross margins.  At the same time, the merchant energy cost structure has not yet been reduced to going-forward levels due to managing the wholesale marketing contracts until they are divested.  While merchant generation assets continue to run well, energy and capacity values realized in 2005 remain modest.
The services businesses and NU Enterprises parent lost $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $32.1 million in the first half of 2005, primarily as a result of an after-tax charge of $25.3 million associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets associated with those businesses and because of write-offs associated with certain construction contracts.  Management expects to sell the energy services businesses before the end of 2005.  In 2004, the services businesses and NU Enterprises parent lost $1.9 million in the second quarter and $2.2 million in the first half of 2004.
Parent company and other after-tax expenses totaled $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with $7.1 million in the same quarter of 2004, when NU recorded a $2.4 million after-tax write-off on an investment in a fuel cell development company.  After-tax parent company and other expenses totaled $6.5 million in the first half of 2005, compared with $11.9 million in 2004.  Results in 2005 were negatively affected by a $2.2 million first-quarter after-tax charge associated with higher manufactured gas plant environmental liabilities at HWP's Mt. Tom coal-fired unit and a second quarter $0.5 million after-tax impairment charge involving a former Yankee Energy System, Inc. note receivable from an operator of renewable energy projects.  First quarter 2004 results reflected an after-tax write-down of approximately $1.5 million associated with that note receivable.  
Parent and Other:  
Future Outlook
The Utility Group continues to estimate that it will earn between $1.22 per share and $1.30 per share in 2005.  That range reflects earnings of between $0.96 per share and $1.00 per share in the regulated distribution and generation businesses and between $0.26 per share and $0.30 per share at the transmission business.
Utility Group:  
 The earnings of NU Enterprises have been and will continue to be impacted by many factors, including potential further asset impairments or losses on disposals that could result from the decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses, changes in market prices which currently impact earnings because of the application of mark-to-market accounting to certain wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are divested or expire and other closure costs. Accordingly, NU is not providing NU Enterprises 2005 earnings guidance.
NU Enterprises:
 Parent and other costs, primarily related to interest expense, continue to be estimated to total between $0.08 per share and $0.13 per share in 2005.
Parent and Other:
Liquidity
NU continues to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.  At June 30, 2005, NU had $55.5 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $47 million at December 31, 2004.  
Consolidated:  
Cash flows from operations decreased by $217 million from $493.9 million for the first six months of 2004 to $276.9 million for the first six months of 2005.  The decrease in operating cash flows is due to higher regulatory refunds, primarily due to lower Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) and Generation Service Charge (GSC) collections as CL&P refunds amounts to its ratepayers for past overcollections or uses those amounts to recover current costs and changes in working capital items, primarily investments in securitizable assets and accounts payable.  Investments in securitizable assets are receivables and unbilled revenues which are eligible to be but have not been sold to the financial institution under CL&P's receivables sales arrangement.  Investments in securitizable assets, when combined with receivables and unbilled revenues, increased by $7.6 million in part due to CL&P rate increases in the first half of 2005 for Tr ansitional Standard Offer (TSO) and FMCC charges compared with a decrease of $55.6 million in the first half of 2004.  
In 2004, net cash flows from operations totaled $517.1 million for the entire year, or only $23.2 million more than for the first six months of 2004.  The primary reason for the low level of cash flows in the second half of 2004 was significant regulatory refunds to customers from CL&P.  Management anticipates that Utility Group net cash flows in the second half of 2005 will significantly exceed those in the second half of 2004.  However, if NU Enterprises succeeds in buying out many more of its below-market wholesale marketing contracts, NU would need to borrow on its $500 million revolving credit line, provide additional equity infusions to NU Enterprises, or a combination of the two.  As of June 30, 2005, there was $147 million borrowed on that revolving credit line, of which $450 million can be borrowed presently, and an additional $78.3 million of letters of credit (LOCs).  There was also $30 million borrowed by NU's re gulated companies on their separate $400 million revolving credit line.  Both credit lines mature in November 2009.  Additionally, CL&P has an arrangement with a financial institution under which CL&P can sell up to $100 million of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues.  At June 30, 2005, CL&P had sold $60 million to that financial institution.
On June 22, 2005, NU companies closed on the sale of approximately 39 acres of property in Stamford, Connecticut to an unaffiliated developer.  The property formerly served as a manufactured gas plant and later as an electric generation plant.  The sales price was approximately $24 million resulting in a gain of $13.6 million which was recorded as a regulatory liability, and will be used as an offset to stranded costs.  The cost of the land included amounts recorded related to environmental remediation.  The developer assumed financial responsibility and liability associated with the environmental cleanup.  Proceeds were used primarily to reduce short-term debt.
On June 23, 2005, NU filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking authority to issue up to $750 million of new securities, including common equity, preferred equity and debt.  NU expects to issue additional common equity no later than 2006 and possibly as early as late 2005.  The proceeds will be used to fund the Utility Group's capital investment initiatives.  In the first half of 2005, NU infused $141.5 million of equity into the Utility Group companies, including $122 million into CL&P.  An equity issuance would strengthen NU's balance sheet.  The issuance of $200 million of debt primarily to support CL&P's capital program, combined with losses associated with exiting the wholesale marketing business and divesting the energy services businesses has caused a decrease in the equity component of total consolidated capitalization.  At June 30, 2005, total short and long-ter m debt, excluding rate reduction bonds, represented 59 percent of consolidated capitalization.  
Exiting the wholesale marketing business will have an impact on cash outflows, the magnitude of which will depend upon the method of exiting.  The negative mark-to-market on the wholesale contracts being divested at June 30, 2005 was $250 million.  If these contracts were settled at this amount, there would be significant cash tax benefits.  This, combined with the anticipated positive after-tax cash proceeds related to selling the energy services businesses, is expected to reduce the negative cash outflows to a manageable amount from a liquidity and leverage standpoint.
NU's credit ratings outlooks at Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P) are currently stable and management does not believe that at this time there is a significant risk of a ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade levels.  However, if NU were to be downgraded to a sub-investment grade level, this downgrade could have a negative impact on NU's liquidity.
On June 30, 2005, NU paid a dividend of $0.1625 per share.  On May 10, 2005, the NU Board of Trustees approved a common dividend of $0.175 per share, payable September 30, 2005, to shareholders of record at September 1, 2005.  The dividend represents the fifth consecutive annual increase approved by the Board of Trustees.  
NU's capital expenditures totaled $332.1 million in the first six months of 2005, compared with $302.7 million in the first six months of 2004.  The higher level of spending reflects increased investment at the Utility Group.  NU projects capital expenditures to total $740 million in 2005.  
On May 27, 2005, S&P downgraded all rated securities for NU's companies by one notch, except for those of NGC, which were affirmed with a negative outlook.  The downgrade did not result in a material increase in borrowing costs or other negative factors.  All S&P ratings for NU's companies, except for those of NGC, are now stable.
On July 21, 2005, Yankee Gas closed on the sale of $50 million of 30-year first-mortgage bonds.  The interest rate was 5.35 percent.  Proceeds were used to repay short-term borrowings incurred to finance capital expenditures.
Utility Group:  
WMECO is expected to issue a separate $50 million of senior unsecured notes in August 2005.  The issuance was approved on June 9, 2005 by the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE).  An application for PSNH to issue $50 million of first mortgage bonds later in 2005 is pending with the NHPUC.
During the first half of 2005, liquidity benefited from counterparty collateral deposits received exceeding counterparty collateral deposits made by $20 million.  
NU Enterprises:  
The charges recorded in the first half of 2005 were primarily non-cash in nature.  The cash and liquidity impacts of exiting the wholesale marketing and energy services businesses are discussed above.  
Most of the working capital and LOCs required by NU Enterprises are currently used to support the wholesale marketing business.  As NU Enterprises' wholesale contracts expire or are divested, its liquidity requirements are expected to decline.  Currently, NU Enterprises' liquidity is impacted by both the amount of collateral from other counterparties it receives and the amount of collateral it is required to deposit with counterparties.  The sale or renegotiation of the longer-term below market electricity contracts, however, will likely require NU Enterprises to make significant upfront payments to the counterparties in such transactions.
NU Enterprises Divestitures
NU Enterprises continues to work toward the goal of exiting the wholesale marketing business by the end of 2005.  NU Enterprises is continuing to evaluate several alternatives to accomplish this goal, including selling the wholesale portfolio of contracts, restructuring long-term wholesale contracts, and serving out some or all of the remaining contracts until they expire.  During the second quarter of 2005, NU Enterprises solicited bids from firms that wanted to purchase all or a large portion of the wholesale portfolio of contracts with 28 firms expressing interest in the wholesale portfolio of contracts and 15 firms submitting indicative bids.
Wholesale Marketing Business:
In parallel, NU Enterprises is restructuring its long-dated contract obligations and has reached agreements to buy out 6 of the 15 municipal contracts that are being sold.  Those 6 contracts, which account for over 20 percent of the value of these load obligations, will terminate between September 1, 2005 and March 1, 2006.  Active negotiations are continuing with the other 9 municipalities, and NU Enterprises remains hopeful that it will be able to renegotiate or sell all of those contracts in 2005 under acceptable terms.   
NU Enterprises is also seeking to divest the contracts to serve a number of investor-owned utilities in New England and PJM over the next three years.  These contracts currently total approximately 26 million megawatt-hours of sales obligations.  Approximately 75 percent of the sales and purchase obligations are for delivery over the next 12 months.  These contracts are essentially volumetrically balanced based on the company's projected load obligations; however, load variability could result in an inbalance.  Such an inbalance or significant changes in basis prices could have material economic consequences.  If NU Enterprises cannot sell this portfolio of contracts on acceptable terms, then contracts would be divested individually or served out.
 NU Enterprises continues to work to complete the divestiture of its energy services businesses by the end of 2005.  During the second quarter of 2005, a number of parties have expressed interest in those companies and NU Enterprises was in the process of receiving and analyzing bids for several of these businesses with the expectation of selling these businesses by the end of 2005.
Energy Services Businesses:
Business Development and Capital Expenditures
Utility Group:
Transmission capital expenditures in Connecticutare focused primarily on four major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut.  These projects include the Bethel, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut and Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut projects, as well as a related 115 kilovolt (kV) underground project, and the replacement of the existing Long Island cable.  Each of these projects has received approval from the Connecticut Siting Council (CSC).  Capital expenditures for the southwest Connecticut transmission projects totaled $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  In 2005, CL&P's transmission capital expenditures in southwest Connecticut are projected to total approximately $155 million.  
Connecticut  CL&P:  
On April 7, 2005, the CSC unanimously approved a proposal by CL&P and UI to build a 69-mile 345 kV transmission line from Middletown to Norwalk.  Approximately 24 miles of the 345 kV line will be built underground with the balance being built overhead.  The project still requires CSC review of detailed construction plans, as well as United States Army Corps of Engineers approval to bury the line beneath certain navigable rivers.  CL&P expects the project to be completed by the end of 2009.  The project is currently expected to cost between $840 million and $990 million with CL&P owning 80 percent of the project.  The CSC's approval included variations to the proposed route for which the CL&P is reevaluating the project costs.  The period to appeal the CSC's approval ended May 27, 2005 and legal review of the three appeals filed is ongoing.  However, CL&P, at this time, does not expect any of th ese three appeals to delay construction.  At June 30, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $26 million associated with this project.
In March 2005, CL&P signed contracts for construction of a 21-mile 345 kV line between Bethel and Norwalk.  Line construction activities began in April 2005, although a considerable amount of substation work had been completed earlier.  This project is now approximately 30 percent complete and CL&P expects to complete the project by the end of 2006 at a cost of between $300 million and $350 million.  The cost range reflects that not all vendor contracts have been signed.  At June 30, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $95 million associated with this project.
 
CL&P's construction of two 115 kV underground transmission lines between Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut was approved by the CSC on July 20, 2005.  The project is expected to cost approximately $120 million and meet growing electric demands in the area.  Management expects the lines to be in service during 2008.  At June 30, 2005, CL&P has capitalized $5 million related to this project.
On October 1, 2004, CL&P and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) jointly filed plans with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to replace an undersea 13-mile electric transmission line between Norwalk, Connecticut and Northport - Long Island, New York, consistent with a comprehensive settlement agreement reached on June 24, 2004.  This project is estimated to cost in the range of $114 million to $135 million with CL&P and LIPA each owning approximately 50 percent of the line.  The cost range reflects that vendor contracts have not yet been signed.  On June 20, 2005, the New York State Controller's Officer and the New York State Attorney General approved an agreement between CL&P and LIPA to replace the cable and the project had earlier received CSC approval.  Federal approvals also are expected in 2005.  Assuming final approval is received in 2005, construction activities are scheduled to begin i n the fall of 2006 and management expects the line will be in service by 2007.  At June 30, 2005,  CL&P has capitalized $8 million of costs related to this project.
In January 2005, Yankee Gas held formal groundbreaking for a liquefied natural gas storage and production facility in Waterbury, Connecticut, which will be capable of storing the equivalent of 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  Construction of the facility began in March and is expected to be completed in 2007 in time for the 2007-2008 heating season.  This project is now approximately 20 percent complete.  The facility is expected to cost $108 million and through June 30, 2005, Yankee Gas has capitalized $28.1 million related to this project.
Connecticut  Yankee Gas:  
Construction activities associated with PSNH's $75 million conversion of a 50-megawatt coal-fired unit at Schiller Station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire began in late 2004 and are expected to be completed in the second half of 2006.  This project is now approximately 55 percent complete.  At June 30, 2005, PSNH has capitalized $41 million related to this project.
New Hampshire:  
As part of the project, a conveyor must be constructed over a single railroad track owned by Boston & Maine Corporation (B&M).  B&M had initially denied PSNH permission to construct this crossing.  A settlement agreement resolving the conveyor issues was reached in June 2005 and all court and regulatory filings have been withdrawn.  As part of this settlement agreement, a license agreement was signed for the track crossing rights along with crossing rights for several other apparatus which were previously subject to short-term crossing rights.
In March 2005, HWP notified Massachusetts environmental regulators that it planned to install a selective catalytic reduction system at the 147 megawatt Mt. Tom coal-fired station in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The system will significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from the unit and extend its operating life.  The $14 million project commenced in July 2005 and is expected to be complete by mid-2006.  At June 30, 2005, HWP has capitalized $2.6 million related to this project.
NU Enterprises:  
Transmission Access and FERC Regulatory Charges
In January 2005, the New England transmission owners approved activation of the New England Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) which occurred on February 1, 2005.  CL&P, WMECO and PSNH are now members of the New England RTO and provide regional open access transmission service over their combined transmission system under the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, FERC Electric Tariff No. 3 and local open access transmission service under the ISO-NE Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff, FERC Electric No. 3, Schedule 21  NU.
In June 2004, the transmission business reached a settlement agreement with the parties to its rate case, allowing NU to implement a formula-based LNS tariff with an allowed ROE of 11.0 percent.  This settlement was approved by the FERC in September 2004.  As a result of the RTO start-up on February 1, 2005, the ROE in the LNS tariff was increased to 12.8 percent.  The ROE being utilized in the calculation of the current RNS rates is the sum of the 12.8 percent "base" ROE, plus a 50 basis point incentive adder for joining the RTO, or a total of 13.3 percent.  An initial decision by a FERC ALJ has set the base ROE at 10.72 percent as compared with the 12.8 percent requested by the New England RTO.  One of the adjustments made by the ALJ was to modify the underlying proxy group used to determine the ROE, resulting in a reduction in the base ROE of approximately 50 basis points.  The ALJ also deferred to the FERC final re solution on the 100 basis point incentive adder for new transmission investments.  The ALJ reaffirmed the 50 basis point incentive for joining the RTO.  The New England transmission owners have challenged the ALJ's findings and recommendations through written exceptions filed on June 27, 2005.  A final order from the FERC is expected by December 2005.  Management cannot at this time predict what ROE will ultimately be established by the FERC in the ongoing proceedings.  However, for purposes of current earnings estimates, the transmission business is assuming an ROE that is more conservative than that reflected in current transmission rates.
Legislative Matters
On August 8, 2005, President Bush is expected to sign into law comprehensive energy legislation.  Among other provisions potentially affecting NU are: the repeal of the 1935 Act; FERC backstop siting authority for transmission and transmission rate reform; renewable production tax credits; and accelerated depreciation for certain new electric and gas facilities.  The legislation also expressed a "sense of Congress" that the FERC should note the concerns of the New England states with regard to LICAP and carefully consider their objections.
Connecticut:
 On July 6, 2005, Governor Rell signed legislation creating a mechanism to allow regulators to periodically true-up the retail transmission charge in distribution company rates based on changes in FERC-approved charges.  This mechanism will allow CL&P to promptly recover its transmission expenditures.
Transmission Tracking Mechanism:
 Public Act 05-01, an "Act Concerning Energy Independence," was signed by Governor Rell on July 22, 2005.  The new legislation provides incentives to encourage the construction of distributed generation, new large-scale generation, and conservation and load management initiatives to reduce FMCC charges.  FMCC charges represent the costs of power market rules approved by the FERC that are resulting in significantly higher costs for Connecticut.  The most significant cost item in 2005 is RMR contracts, and proposed for 2006, a new administrative rule called LICAP.  The bill requires regulators to a) implement near-term measures as soon as possible, and b) commence a new request for proposals to build  customer side distributed resources and contracts for new or repowered larger generating facilities in the state.  Developers could receive contracts of up to 15 years from the distribution c ompanies.  The bill provides utilities with the opportunity to earn one-time awards for generation that is installed in their service territories.  Those awards can be as high as $200 per kilowatt for distributed generation and $25 per kilowatt for more traditional generation.  It also allows distribution companies, such as CL&P, to bid as much as 250 MW of capacity into the request for proposals.  If such utility bid was accepted, then the unit after five years would have to be a) sold; b) have its capacity sold; or c) both, provided that the DPUC could waive these requirements.  The bill also requires the DPUC to investigate the financial impact on distribution companies of entering into long-term contracts and to allow distribution companies to recover through rates any increased costs.  
Energy Legislation:
New Hampshire:
 The New Hampshire legislature will be considering a bill in its 2006 legislative session that would place strict limitations on the level of mercury that PSNH's existing generation plants can emit.  This bill was first proposed in the 2005 session, but was subsequently set aside and retained for the 2006 session.  Management has been reviewing the proposed legislation and assessing how PSNH might meet any required reduction in mercury emissions should such strict limitations be established.  PSNH's alternatives range from the installation of additional pollution control equipment, reducing operating capacity of its plants and possible retirement of one or more of its generating units.  PSNH conducted testing of one control technology at its Merrimack Station during the summer of 2005.  While state law and PSNH's restructuring agreement provide for the recovery of its generation costs, including the cost to comply with state environmental regulations, at this time management is unable to determine the impact of any potential new legislation on PSNH's net income or financial position.
Environmental Legislation:
Utility Group Regulatory Issues and Rate Matters
 Wholesale transmission revenues are based on rates and formulas that are approved by the FERC.  Most of NU's wholesale transmission revenues are collected through a combination of the RNS tariff and NU's LNS tariff.  NU's LNS rate is reset on January 1 and June 1 of each year.  Additionally, NU's LNS tariff provides for a true-up to actual costs, which ensures that NU's transmission business recovers its total transmission revenue requirements, including the allowed ROE.  For the six months ended June 30, 2005, this true up has resulted in the recognition of a $1.6 million regulatory asset.   
Transmission - Wholesale Rates:
st
st
 A significant portion of the NU transmission business revenue comes from ISO-NE charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO.  The distribution businesses recover these costs through the retail rates that are charged to their retail customers.  For CL&P, any difference between the revenues received from retail customers and the retail transmission expenses charged to the distribution business has historically impacted the distribution business's earnings.  However, beginning in July 2005, CL&P will track its retail transmission revenues and expenses and adjust its retail transmission rates on a regular basis and thereby recover all of its retail transmission expenses on a timely basis.  This ratemaking change resulted from the enactment of the new legislation passed by a Connecticut legislative session.  WMECO implemented its retail transmission tracker and rate adjustment mechanism in January 2002 as part of its 2002 rate change filing.  PSNH does not currently have a transmission rate tracking mechanism.  
Transmission - Retail Rates:
  
In March 2004, ISO-NE filed a proposal at the FERC to implement LICAP.  LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a fixed reserve margin and a statistically-determined contingency.  In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones, including two in Connecticut, and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology.  The demand curve will be used to determine pricing.  The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings.  The hearings on the demand curve and associated issues ended on March 31, 2005 and an initial decision from the FERC ALJ was issued on June 15, 2005.  The ALJ largely adopted the demand curve as filed by ISO-NE.  On July 15, 2005, ISO-NE filed a motion with the FERC requesting a FERC decision no later than September 15, 2005 to allow for implementation by January 1, 2006.
LICAP:  
On March 23, 2005, the FERC issued two orders affirming its prior decisions regarding the LICAP market and the creation of two separate LICAP and energy zones in Connecticut.  These orders were appealed by CL&P, the DPUC, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC), and the Connecticut Attorney General to the First Circuit Court of Appeals which dismissed the appeal without prejudice on May 5, 2005.  Management cannot at this time predict the outcome of these FERC proceedings.
If LICAP is implemented, LICAP costs totaling several hundred million dollars annually will be incurred, in part, because Connecticut is a constrained area with insufficient generation assets.  These costs would be expected to be recovered from CL&P's customers through the FMCC mechanism.  PSNH and WMECO also will incur LICAP charges, but to a lesser degree and will also expect to recover these costs from their customers.   
Connecticut - CL&P:    
 On June 30, 2005, the DPUC issued a final decision which requires CL&P to recalculate all previously issued refunds (except the towns of Stamford and Middletown) utilizing applicable approved pre-tax cost of capital rates.  The final decision also provides for a five year period for those towns that wish to phase in the purchase of their streetlights in which to complete the asset purchase.  As a result of this decision, CL&P recorded an additional $7.4 million of pre-tax reserve for streetlight billing in the second quarter of 2005.  CL&P expects to file an appeal of this decision in August 2005.
Streetlighting Decision:
 CL&P is currently allowed to collect a fixed procurement fee of 0.50 mills per kWh from customers who purchase TSO service through 2006.  One mill is equal to one-tenth of a cent.  That fee can increase to 0.75 mills if CL&P outperforms certain regional benchmarks.  The fixed portion of the procurement fee amounted to approximately $12 million (approximately $7 million after-tax) for 2004.  On September 15, 2004, CL&P submitted to the DPUC its proposed methodology to calculate the variable portion (incentive portion) of the procurement fee.  On November 18, 2004 the DPUC suspended this proceeding.  On May 13, 2005, CL&P filed a motion to reopen this docket which was granted by the DPUC on June 30, 2005.  As part of that filing, CL&P also requested approval of $5.8 million for its 2004 incentive payment and again requested that the DPUC approve the propo sed methodology.  The schedule in this proceeding has not yet been determined.  The variable portion of the procurement fee has not yet been reflected in earnings.
Procurement Fee Rate Proceedings:
 
 
On February 1, 2005, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to obtain approval to defer for future recovery in its retail transmission rate the increased transmission costs that CL&P is incurring.  As a result of the legislation described above, CL&P withdrew its application and filed for a transmission adjustment clause on August 1, 2005 with the rate tracking mechanism effective in July 2005.
Retail Transmission Rate Filing:
: The CTA allows CL&P to recover stranded costs, such as securitization costs associated with the rate reduction bonds, amortization of regulatory assets, and IPP over market costs, while the System Benefits Charge (SBC) allows CL&P to recover certain regulatory and energy public policy costs, such as public education outreach costs, hardship protection costs, transition period property taxes, and displaced worker protection costs.   
CTA and SBC Reconciliation
On April 1, 2005, CL&P filed its 2004 CTA and SBC reconciliation with the DPUC, which compared CTA and SBC revenues to revenue requirements.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, total CTA revenues exceeded the CTA revenue requirements by $14.1 million.  This amount was recorded as a regulatory liability on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  For the same period, SBC revenues exceeded the SBC revenue requirement by $3.6 million which was recorded as a regulatory liability.  Management expects a decision in this docket from the DPUC by the end of 2005.  
Most of CL&P's customers buy their energy at CL&P's TSO rate, rather than buying energy directly from competitive suppliers.  On December 22, 2004, the DPUC approved an increase of 16.2 percent in TSO rates effective January 1, 2005, although the impact was partially offset by a continuation of the CTA refund.  The DPUC also ordered that projected 2004 and 2005 CTA overrecoveries and half of projected 2004 distribution overrecoveries be used to moderate increases for customers that otherwise would occur when the current CTA refund expired on May 1, 2005.  Overall, the final decision approved an increase to the January 2004 TSO rates of approximately 10.4 percent, including the effects of existing and new refunds and overrecoveries.  The DPUC denied requests by the Connecticut Attorney General and OCC to defer the recovery of higher supplier costs into future years.  On February& nbsp;3, 2005, the OCC filed an appeal with the Connecticut Superior Court challenging this decision.  This appeal is identical to the appeal filed with the same court in February 2004 challenging the DPUC's December 2003 decision.  Management believes that this appeal will not impact the DPUC's December 22, 2004 order.
CL&P TSO Rates:  
Also, pursuant to state law, on December 19, 2003, the DPUC set CL&P's TSO rates for January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 and confirmed that state law exempted FMCC charges, Energy Adjustment Clause (EAC) charges and certain other charges from the statutorily imposed rate cap.  The OCC filed appeals of this decision with the Connecticut Superior Court.  The OCC claims that the decision improperly implements an EAC charge under Connecticut law, fails to properly define and identify the fees that CL&P will be allowed to collect from customers and improperly calculates base rates for purposes of determining the rate cap.  Management believes that these appeals will not impact the TSO rates approved by the DPUC.
On May 16, 2005, the DPUC approved a 4.8 percent increase to customer rates related to $79.8 million of additional RMR contract costs, which have been approved by the FERC.  This additional amount will be recovered over the period June through December 2005 through an increase to the FMCC rates effective June 1, 2005.  On July 29, 2005, the DPUC issued a draft decision that supports the interim rate increase approved in May 2005 and a final decision is expected by the end of August 2005.
New Hampshire:
In accordance with the "Agreement to Settle PSNH Restructuring" and state law, PSNH files for updated TS/DS rates periodically to ensure timely recovery of its costs.  The TS/DS rate recovers PSNH's generation and purchased power costs, including a return on PSNH's generation assets.  PSNH defers for future recovery or refund any difference between its TS/DS revenues and the actual costs incurred.
TS/DS Rates:
On January 28, 2005 the NHPUC issued an order approving a TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh for the period February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006.  This NHPUC order continued the practice of requiring an interim review of TS/DS costs for a possible TS/DS rate change effective August 1, 2005.  The TS/DS rate of $0.0649 per kWh included an 11 percent ROE on PSNH's generation assets.  This generation ROE was the subject of a second set of proceedings in this docket in which PSNH subsequently filed testimony supporting an 11.4 percent ROE on its generation assets while the NHPUC staff advocated an ROE of 9.08 percent.  On June 8, 2005, the NHPUC issued an order requiring PSNH to use a generation ROE of 9.63 percent, effective July 1, 2005.  This decrease in allowed ROE will lower PSNH's net income by approximately $1.4 million annually based on the current level of generation asset investment.
On July 7, 2005, PSNH filed a motion for reconsideration in the ROE portion of above docket.  PSNH's motion cited several issues with the NHPUC's order, including a mathematical error and the generation ROE not being commensurate with the risks associated with generation assets.  PSNH is awaiting a response from the NHPUC as to this motion.  
On July 1, 2005, after a review of its TS/DS costs, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting an increase in the TS/DS rate from the current $0.0649 per kWh to $0.0734 per kWh based on actual costs and underrecoveries incurred to date and updated cost projections.  The updated cost projections include an increase in costs as a direct result of higher fuel and purchased power costs that PSNH expects to incur.  The generation ROE used in the updated cost projections was based upon the 9.63 percent ROE ordered on June 8, 2005.  An order changing the TS/DS rate to $0.0724 per kWh, effective August 1, 2005 was issued by the NHPUC on August 1, 2005.
The Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC) allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs.  On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC a SCRC reconciliation filing for the preceding calendar year.  This filing includes the reconciliation of stranded cost revenues and costs and TS/DS revenues and costs.  The NHPUC reviews the filing, including a prudence review of the operation of PSNH's generation assets.  The cumulative deferral of SCRC revenues in excess of costs was $227.4 million at June 30, 2005.  This cumulative deferral will decrease the amount of non-securitized stranded costs that will have to be recovered from PSNH's customers in the future from $386.7 million to $159.3 million
SCRC Reconciliation Filing:
.
The 2004 SCRC reconciliation filing was filed with the NHPUC on May 2, 2005.  The NHPUC has scheduled a hearing in late October 2005.  Management does not expect the NHPUC's review of the 2004 SCRC filing to have a material impact on PSNH's net income or financial position.
The SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms currently reconcile accrued expenses with billed revenues on a monthly basis.  PSNH has included a request, and supporting testimony, to include unbilled revenues as part of the reconciliation process in its annual 2004 SCRC and TS/DS reconciliation filing.  This request will allow for the reconciliation of revenues on an accrual basis with the current accrued expenses recovered through the SCRC and TS/DS rate mechanisms, consistent with accrual accounting.  At June 30, 2005, PSNH's unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS was $11.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  If approved, this change will allow for the inclusion of accrued unbilled revenue balances in the recovery of SCRC and TS/DS costs.  Management believes that the unbilled revenue balance related to SCRC and TS/DS is probable of being recovered from PSNH's customers.
On May 19, 2005, the FERC issued an order allowing PSNH to bill wholesale distribution rates under the terms of its settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement allows PSNH to recover certain delivery costs arising from the provision of wholesale delivery service to another New Hampshire utility.  The effect of the settlement agreement will be to increase PSNH's annual revenues by approximately $1.8 million.
Wholesale Distribution Rate Case:  
 
Massachusetts:
On March 31, 2005, WMECO filed its 2004 transition cost reconciliation with the DTE.  The DTE has combined the 2003 and 2004 transition cost reconciliation filings, the standard offer service and default service reconciliations, and the transmission cost adjustment filings into a single proceeding.  The timing of a decision in the combined proceeding is uncertain, but management does not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's net income or financial position.
Transition Cost Reconciliation and Other Filings:  
On March 4, 2005, WMECO filed an application requesting permission to issue long-term debt securities not to exceed $50 million through December 31, 2005 and also requested approval to enter into interest rate locks.  Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt will be used to refinance short-term debt and finance planned capital expenditures.  On June 9, 2005, the DTE issued a decision approving the $50 million financing and interest rate lock application and an interest rate lock was entered into in June 2005.
Financing Debt Issuance Application:  
Nuclear Decommissioning and Plant Closure Costs
The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPC) is involved in an ongoing FERC proceeding to recover its increased estimate of decommissioning and plant closure costs and is also involved in litigation over the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation (Bechtel).  The company cannot at this time predict the timing or outcome of the FERC proceeding or the outcome of the litigation with Bechtel.
CYAPC, Yankee Atomic Electric Company and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company commenced litigation in 1998 charging that the federal government breached contracts it entered into with each company in 1983 regarding the removal of spent nuclear fuel.  Management can predict neither the outcome of this matter nor its ultimate impact on NU.
For further information regarding these issues, see Note 6D, "Deferred Contractual Obligations," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NU Enterprises
NU Enterprises currently has two business segments:  the merchant energy business segment and the energy services and other business segment.
 The merchant energy business segment includes Select Energy's retail marketing business, 1,443 MW of generation assets, including 1,296 MW of primarily pumped storage and hydroelectric generation assets at NGC, 147 MW of coal-fired generation assets at HWP and NGS.
Merchant Energy Segment:
The merchant energy segment also continues to include the wholesale marketing business, which NU Enterprise will exit.  Prior to the March 2005 decision to exit this business, the wholesale business was comprised primarily of full requirements sales to LDCs and bilateral sales to other load-serving counterparties.  These sales were sourced by the generation assets and an inventory of energy contracts.  
 
 In March of 2005 NU Enterprises announced that it would explore ways to divest the energy services businesses in a manner that maximizes their value.  These businesses include the operations of the contracting businesses of NGS' contracting businesses including Woods Electrical, SESI, SECI, Reeds Ferry, and Woods Network.  SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical are classified as discontinued operations.  
Energy Services and Other Segment:
 NU will not provide 2005 earnings guidance for NU Enterprises because earnings at NU Enterprises for the remainder of 2005 will likely be impacted by many factors, such as:
Outlook:
The application of mark-to-market accounting to most wholesale marketing contracts until those contracts are settled or until the commodities are delivered.  The value of these contracts have and will fluctuate with changes in electricity and capacity values and with gas prices that are used to value the long-term portions of the contracts.  These changes in value have been reflected in earnings and have been significant.  These changes could continue to be significant until the contracts are divested.
 
The recognition of additional gains or losses on wholesale marketing contracts that have not been recorded yet.  Many full requirements contracts have quantities of electricity expected to be delivered in amounts different from the notional amounts that were multiplied by current market prices to determine the mark-to-market charge.  In addition, gains or losses may be recorded on the disposition of these wholesale contracts.
Additional asset impairments or losses on disposals.  As the services businesses are marketed there could be additional impairments or losses on disposals to the extent sales are consummated.  NU guarantees the performance of certain services companies, and the fair value of those guarantees may be recognized if they become guarantees to third parties.
The recognition of additional restructuring costs.  Costs associated with certain restructuring activities and employee costs are expected to be recognized in future periods as incurred.
 There were no CL&P TSO purchases from Select Energy in the second quarter of 2005, compared to $108.3 million of CL&P standard offer purchases from Select Energy in the second quarter of 2004.  Other energy purchases between CL&P and Select Energy totaled $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $27.7 million in the second quarter of 2004.  WMECO purchases from Select Energy in the second quarter of 2005 totaled $17.4 million, compared to $21 million in the second quarter of 2004.  In February 2005, WMECO entered into a contract with Select Energy under which Select Energy provided default service from April through June of 2005.  These amounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Intercompany Transactions:
There were no CL&P TSO purchases from Select Energy in the first six months of 2005, compared to $256.8 million of CL&P standard offer purchases from Select Energy in the first six months of 2004.  Other energy purchases between CL&P and Select Energy totaled $26.7 million in the first six months of 2005 compared to $57.7 million in the first six months of 2004.  WMECO purchases from Select Energy in the first six months of 2005 totaled $37.9 million, compared to $53 million in the first six months of 2004.  These amounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Included in these charges is a $15.7 million and $70.2 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, related to an intercompany contract between Select Energy and CL&P.  The contract extends through 2013 at below current market prices for CL&P.  This contract is part of CL&P's stranded costs, and benefits received by CL&P under this contract are provided to CL&P's ratepayers.  A $2.8 million pre-tax mark-to-market charge for the three months ended March 31, 2005, was recorded as wholesale contract market changes by Select Energy for the intercompany contract between Select Energy and WMECO for default service from April to June of 2005.  There were no wholesale contract market changes in the second quarter of 2005 as this contract expired on June 30, 2005.  WMECO's benefits under this contract will be provided to ratepayers in the form of lower than market default service rates.  These charges were not eliminated in consolidation because on a consolidated basis NU retains the over-market obligation to the ratepayers of CL&P and WMECO.
The decision to exit the wholesale marketing business is expected to reduce the risk profile of NU Enterprises.  Until exiting the wholesale marketing business, NU Enterprises will continue to be exposed to certain market risks for existing contracts until they expire or are divested.  Contracts with lower quantities and less complex terms will result in an NU Enterprises risk profile that is reduced compared to the current wholesale marketing business.  The merchant energy business segment will be comprised of generation assets and the retail marketing segment, which will enter into contracts of varying lengths of time to buy and sell energy commodities, including electricity, natural gas, and oil to customers.  Market risk represents the loss that may affect the merchant energy business segment's financial results, primarily Select Energy, due to adverse changes in commodity market prices.
Risk Management:  
Risk management within Select Energy has been organized to address the market, credit and operational exposures arising from the merchant energy business segment.  The framework for managing these risks is set forth in NU's risk management policies and procedures, which are in the process of being revised in light of NU Enterprises' change in focus from wholesale marketing to retail marketing and merchant generation.  These new policies and procedures will be reviewed with the NU Board of Trustees when completed, and periodically thereafter as appropriate.
Select Energy manages its portfolio of retail marketing contracts to maximize value while operating within NU's corporate risk tolerance.  Select Energy generally acquires retail customers in small increments, which while requiring careful sourcing allows energy purchases to be acquired in small increments with low risk.  However, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
Retail Marketing Activities:   
Currently, the number of commercial and industrial customers seeking to leave their transmission and distribution companies for the purpose of securing competitive electric and gas supplies continues to rise.  In 2005, NU Enterprises is bidding on 50 percent more retail business than in 2004, with a 20 percent success rate in 2005 as compared to 13 percent last year.
NU Enterprises expects retail revenues to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2005, compared with about $850 million in 2004.  Through the first six months of 2005, 5.3 million megawatt-hours were delivered as compared to 4.8 million megawatt-hours in 2004.  For natural gas, NU Enterprises delivered 27.8 billion cubic feet in the first six months of 2005 as compared to 22.5 billion cubic feet in the first six months of 2004.  NU Enterprises expects delivered megawatt-hours to reach 13 million in 2005, compared with 10 million in 2004 and for delivered natural gas to exceed 60 billion cubic feet in 2005, and increase from 40 billion cubic feet in 2004.
On average, electric unit margins on new business range from $1.60 to $2.20 a megawatt-hour.  For natural gas, unit margins are expected to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per thousand cubic feet.  If the projected volumes are multiplied by unit margins, NU Enterprises' 2005 gross margin goal is approximately $40 million, $25 million electric and $15 million gas.  Based on what has been delivered to date and what is under contract, NU Enterprises has secured approximately 70 percent of the gross margin projected for 2005.  With many customers signing month-to-month or three-month contracts, expecting that energy prices will decrease, NU Enterprises is within reach of 2005 targeted margins.
From time to time, the retail marketing business line enters into contracts that cannot immediately receive accrual accounting and therefore changes in fair value are required to be marked-to-market and included in earnings.
At June 30, 2005, Select Energy had retail derivative assets and liabilities as follows:   
The methods used to determine the fair value of retail energy sourcing contracts are identified and segregated in the table of fair value of contracts at June 30, 2005.  A description of each method is as follows: 1) prices actively quoted primarily represent New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures, swaps and options that are marked to closing exchange prices; and 2) prices provided by external sources primarily include over-the-counter forwards and options, including bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, and are marked to the mid-point of bid and ask market prices.  
Generally, valuations of short-term contracts derived from quotes or other external sources are more reliable should there be a need to liquidate the contracts, while valuations for longer-term contracts are less certain.  Accordingly, there is a risk that contracts will not be realized at the amounts recorded.  
As of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the sources of the fair value of retail energy sourcing contracts and the changes in fair value of these contracts are included in the following tables.  Intercompany transactions are eliminated and not reflected in the amounts below.
Subsequent to March 31, 2005, management elected to retain certain contracts to help support its retail marketing business, and market changes are now recorded to fuel, purchased and net interchange power on the condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.
For further information regarding Select Energy's derivative contracts, see Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
The generation assets, either owned by NU Enterprises or contracted with third parties, are subject to certain operational risks, including but not limited to the length of scheduled and non-scheduled outages, bidding and scheduling with various ISOs, environmental issues and fuel costs.  Generation is also subject to various federal, state and local regulations.  These risks may result in changes in the anticipated gross margins which Select Energy realizes from its generation portfolio/activities.  A significant determinant of the future value of generation assets is the implementation of LICAP.
Generation Activities:  
During the first six months of 2005, NU Enterprises' generation assets continued to run well while energy prices have strengthened and reserve margins have started to tighten.  NU Enterprises believes that generating unit availability will become increasingly important as the capacity market tightens in New England due to load growth and the absence of new plant construction.  Through the first six months of 2005, the 1,080 megawatt Northfield Mountain facility had an availability factor of 94 percent, while the 147 megawatt Mt. Tom plant at HWP had an availability factor of 91 percent.  The nearly 200 MW of other hydroelectric units had an aggregate availability factor of 85 percent.
Conventional hydroelectric generation in the first half of 2005 is nearly 10 percent ahead of budget due to above average rainfall and plant availability.  That percentage translates into 400,000 megawatt-hours through June 2005, compared with a projected amount of 370,000 megawatt-hours.  Approximately 1 million megawatt-hours are generated annually at Mt. Tom, a coal-fired unit located in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  Through June 2005, more than 500,000 megawatt-hours were generated at Mt Tom.
For the Northfield Mountain facility, on-peak, off-peak spreads rose to as high as 2:1 in June 2005, an increase from 1.4:1 earlier in 2005.  As a result, NU Enterprises has realized $6 million of energy-related gross margin through June 2005 and is on target to earn the $12 million in energy-related gross margin projected for 2005.
In March 2004, ISO-NE filed a proposal at the FERC to implement LICAP requirements.  LICAP is an administratively determined electric generation capacity pricing mechanism intended to provide a revenue stream sufficient to maintain existing generation assets and encourage the construction of new generation assets at levels sufficient to serve peak load, plus a fixed reserve margin and a statistically-determined contingency.  In June 2004, the FERC ordered the creation of five LICAP zones, including two in Connecticut, and accepted ISO-NE's demand curve methodology.  The demand curve will be used to determine pricing.  The FERC ordered LICAP to be implemented by January 1, 2006, and set certain issues pertaining to the demand curve for hearings.  The hearings on the demand curve and associated issues ended on March 31, 2005 and an initial decision from the FERC ALJ was issued on June 15, 2005.  The ALJ largely adopted the de mand curve as filed by ISO-NE.  On July 15, 2005, ISO-NE filed a motion with the FERC requesting a FERC decision no later than September 15, 2005 to allow for implementation by January 1, 2006.
If LICAP is implemented as recommended by the FERC ALJ, NU Enterprises' pumped storage, conventional hydroelectric and coal-fired generation assets will be eligible for significant LICAP revenues.  ISO-NE has indicated that it needs FERC approval of the LICAP market by September 15, 2005 to have adequate time to implement LICAP on January 1, 2006.  Management believes that if the FERC approves LICAP to take effect on January 1, 2006 consistent with the ALJ recommendation, NU Enterprises will receive approximately $50 million of capacity-related revenue in 2006.  If there is no LICAP market in 2006, it is estimated, based on current capacity values, that the capacity and forward reserve revenue will be somewhat less than $30 million.  
Management also believes that even without the introduction of LICAP, capacity prices will increase to above $3 a kilowatt-month by 2009 with significant additional revenue from forward reserves.  Based on projections related to the New England load growth and capacity situation, management believes that the capacity-related and forward reserve revenue without LICAP could reach $90 million by 2009 which is significantly above the $50 million projected earlier in 2005.  With LICAP, management believes that capacity-related revenue would still be approximately $120 million.  
Because capacity revenues are highly dependent on the amount of available generating capacity compared with peak customer load, management is not certain that such revenues will actually be realized.

Hedging:  
As a result of NU's decision to exit the wholesale marketing and trading businesses, certain wholesale energy contracts previously accounted for under accrual accounting were required to be marked-to-market in the first quarter 2005.  Existing energy trading contracts have been and will continue to be marked-to-market with changes in fair value reflected in the income statement.  
Wholesale Contracts:  
At June 30, 2005, Select Energy had wholesale derivative assets and derivative liabilities as follows:   
Numerous factors could either positively or negatively affect the realization of the net fair value amounts in cash.  These include the amounts paid or received to divest some or all of these contracts, the volatility of commodity prices until the contracts are divested, the outcome of future transactions, the performance of counterparties, and other factors.
Select Energy has policies and procedures requiring all wholesale positions to be marked-to-market at the end of each business day and segregating responsibilities between the individuals actually transacting (front office) and those confirming the trades (middle office).  The determination of the portfolio's fair value is the responsibility of the middle office independent from the front office.
The methods used to determine the fair value of wholesale energy contracts are identified and segregated in the table of fair value of contracts at June 30, 2005.  A description of each method is as follows: 1) prices actively quoted primarily represent NYMEX futures, swaps and options that are marked to closing exchange prices; and 2) prices provided by external sources primarily include over-the-counter forwards and options, including bilateral contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity or natural gas, and are marked to the mid-point of bid and ask market prices.  Currently, Select Energy has several contracts for which a portion of the contract's fair value is determined based on a model or other valuation method.  The model primarily utilizes natural gas prices and a conversion factor to electricity.  Broker quotes for electricity at locations for which Select Energy has entered into deals are generally available through the ye ar 2008.  For all natural gas positions, broker quotes extend through 2013.
Generally, valuations of short-term contracts derived from quotes or other external sources are more reliable should there be a need to liquidate the contracts, while valuations for longer-term contracts are less certain.  Accordingly, there is a risk that contracts will not be realized at the amounts recorded.  
As of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the sources of the fair value of wholesale contracts and the changes in fair value of these contracts are included in the following tables.  Intercompany transactions are eliminated and not reflected in the amounts below.
Changes in fair value of wholesale contracts are recorded as wholesale contract market changes, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income, while changes in fair value of contracts formerly designated as trading are recorded as revenue on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of (loss)/income.
For further information regarding Select Energy's derivative contracts, see Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Counterparty credit risk relates to the risk of loss that Select Energy would incur because of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.  Select Energy has established written credit policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit risk.  These policies require an evaluation of potential counterparties' financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances (including cash advances, LOCs, and parent guarantees), and the use of standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  This evaluation results in establishing credit limits prior to Select Energy's entering into contracts.  The appropriateness of these limits is subject to continuing review.  Concentrations among these counterparties may affect Select Energy' s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes to economic, regulatory or other conditions.  At June 30, 2005, approximately 71 percent of Select Energy's counterparty credit exposure to wholesale and trading counterparties was collateralized or rated BBB- or better.  Select Energy was provided $102.2 million and $57.7 million of counterparty deposits at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  For further information, see Note 1K, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Counterparty Deposits," to the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Counterparty Credit:  
A number of Select Energy's contracts require the posting of additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs in the event NU's ratings were to decline and in increasing amounts dependent upon the severity of the decline.  At NU's present
Select Energy's Credit:  
investment grade ratings, Select Energy has not had to post any collateral based on credit downgrades.  Were NU's unsecured ratings to decline to sub-investment grade by either Moody's or S&P, Select Energy could, under its present contracts, be asked to provide at June 30, 2005 approximately $450 million of collateral or LOCs to various unaffiliated counterparties and approximately $70 million to several independent system operators and unaffiliated LDCs.  If such a downgrade were to occur, management believes NU would currently be able to provide this collateral, subject to the SEC limits.  NU's, Moody's and S&P'S credit ratings outlooks are currently stable and management does not believe that at this time there is a significant risk of a ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade levels.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Update
During 2005, NU recorded restructuring and impairment charges associated with NU Enterprises' decision to exit the wholesale marketing business and to divest the energy material services businesses.  In order for discontinued operations treatment to be appropriate, management must conclude that there is a material component of a business that is "held for sale" for accounting purposes and that NU has no significant continuing involvement.  As the wholesale marketing business is not a component of a business and based on the status of the sale of the services businesses, at this point in time, discontinued operations presentation is not appropriate.  Management will continue to evaluate this classification in the third quarter of 2005 for all NU Enterprises' businesses that are being exited and divested.  During the third quarter of 2005, management determined that it expects to divest four of the energy services businesses within the next year.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2005, SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network, and Woods Electrical were accounted for as discontinued operations.

Risk Factors
NU is subject to a variety of significant risks in addition to the matters set forth under "Other Matters" above.  The company's susceptibility to
certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks.  These risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company's risk profile.
In March 2005, NU announced the decision to exit its wholesale marketing business and divest the energy services businesses.  NU Enterprises is exploring a number of alternatives for exiting these businesses.  To date, however, it has disposed of a portion of the wholesale marketing business and none of the energy services businesses.
Risks Related to Disposition of Wholesale Competitive and Services Businesses:  
While the energy services businesses present a lower level of volatility and risk, the wholesale marketing business, until fully disposed of, will continue to present financial risk to NU from a variety of perspectives.  These include earnings volatility around Select Energy's portfolio of electric supply contracts, which will be accounted for on a mark-to-market basis until disposed of or restructured.  NU has recorded losses associated with this portfolio of $44.2 million after taxes during the second quarter.  The combined first and second quarter earnings charge of $164.3 million associated with this portfolio in the aggregate may not be adequate to absorb future negative price movements which may occur or if further charges are taken if the portfolio is divested.  
NU Enterprises is in the process of exiting the wholesale marketing business.  Select Energy's ability to function will continue to be dependent upon the financial reliability of its counterparties and its ability to manage its wholesale marketing portfolio of contracts and assets within acceptable risk parameters until these contracts are divested.
In March 2005, NU announced it intended to stay in the retail competitive energy and generation businesses.  Select Energy generally acquires retail customer load in small increments, which while requiring careful sourcing, allows energy assets to be acquired with lower risk.  While retail customers have a generally high retention rate, they normally contract for periods of one to two years, making long-term load servicing difficult to evaluate.  In addition, fluctuations in prices, fuel costs, competitive conditions, regulations, weather, transmission costs, lack of market liquidity, plant outages and other factors can all impact the retail business adversely from time to time.
Risks Related to NU Enterprises' Retail Marketing and Merchant Generation Businesses:  
A significant portion of Select Energy's merchant energy marketing activities has been providing electricity to full requirements customers, which are primarily regulated LDCs and commercial and industrial retail customers.  Under the terms of full requirements contracts, Select Energy is required to provide a percentage of the LDC's electricity requirements at all times.  The volumes sold under these contracts vary based on the usage of the LDC's retail electric customers, and usage is dependent upon factors outside of Select Energy's control, such as unanticipated migration or inflow of customers.  The varying sales volumes could be different than the supply volumes that Select Energy expected to utilize, either from its limited generation or from electricity purchase contracts, to serve the full requirements contracts.  Differences between actual sales volumes and supply volumes can require Select Energy to purchase additional electric ity or sell excess electricity, both of which are subject to market conditions such as weather, plant availability, transmission congestion, and potentially volatile price fluctuations that can impact prices and, in turn, Select Energy's margins.
The competitive generation business is also subject to these risks.  In addition, although the market price of near and long-term capacity has increased, the future value of LICAP credits have not been determined and are subject to regulatory decision-making over which NU has no control.  
NU, primarily through its subsidiary CL&P, has undertaken a substantial transmission capital investment program over the past several years and expects to invest more than $1.5 billion in regulated electric transmission infrastructure from 2005 through 2009.  Included in this amount is approximately $1.4 billion for costs associated with construction of two Connecticut 345 kV transmission lines from Middletown to Norwalk and Bethel to Norwalk; replacement of an undersea electric transmission line between Norwalk and Northport, New York; and two 115 kV underground transmission lines between Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut.  The regulatory approval process for these transmission projects has encompassed an extensive permitting, design and technical approval process.  Various factors have resulted in increased cost estimates and delayed constru ction.  
Risks Associated With The Transmission Operations Of NU's Utility Subsidiaries:  
The projects are expected to help alleviate reliability issues in southwest Connecticut and to help reduce customers' costs in all of Connecticut.  However, if, due to further regulatory or other delays, the projected in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed, there may be increased risk of failures in the existing electricity transmission system in southwestern Connecticut and supply interruptions or blackouts may occur.  
The successful implementation of NU's transmission construction plans is also subject to the risk that new legislation, regulations or judicial or regulatory interpretations of applicable law or regulations could impact NU's ability to meet its construction schedule and/or require NU to incur additional expenses, and may adversely affect its ability to achieve forecasted levels of revenues.
CL&P and WMECO procure energy for a substantial portion of their customers via requests for proposal on an annual, semi-annual or quarterly basis.  There is a risk that any given solicitation will not be fully subscribed or that prices will be much higher than current prices.  CL&P and WMECO receive approvals of recovery of these contract prices from the DPUC and DTE, respectively.  While both regulators have consistently approved solicitation processes, results and recovery of costs, management cannot predict the outcome of future solicitation efforts or the regulatory proceedings related thereto.
Risks Associated with the Distribution Operations of NU's Utility Subsidiaries:  
NU and its affiliates are engaged in litigation that could result in the imposition of large cash awards against them.  This litigation includes 1) civil lawsuits between Consolidated Edison, Inc. and NU relating to the parties' October 13, 1999 Agreement and Plan of Merger and 2) the termination of a decommissioning contract between CYAPC, the stock of which is 49
Litigation-Related Risks:  
percent owned by subsidiaries of NU, and Bechtel.  
Further information regarding these legal proceedings, as well as other matters, is set forth in Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," in NU's Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1, "Legal Proceedings" of this Form 10-Q.
NU may also be subject to future litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims and cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings.  Adverse outcomes in existing or future litigation could result in the imposition of substantial cash damage awards against us.  
NU's subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations which regulate, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste.  Compliance with these requirements requires NU to incur significant costs relating to environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation and permitting.  The costs of compliance with these legal requirements may increase in the future.  An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on NU's business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  
Risks Associated With Environmental Regulation:  
NU's failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if due to factors beyond its control or reinterpretations of existing requirements could also increase costs.  
Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to NU.  Revised or additional laws could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on NU's facilities or increased compliance costs that would negatively impact competitive generation margins or which may not be fully recoverable in distribution company rates for regulated generation.  The cost impact of any such legislation would be dependent upon the specific requirements adopted and cannot be determined at this time.

Comparison of the Second Quarter of 2005 to the Second Quarter of 2004
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues increased $46 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004, due to higher electric distribution revenues ($141 million), higher gas distribution revenues ($16 million), and higher regulated transmission revenues ($12 million), partially offset by lower revenues from NU Enterprises ($121 million).  
The electric distribution revenue increase of $141 million is primarily due to non-earnings components of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail rates ($131 million).  The distribution component of these companies and the retail transmission component of CL&P and PSNH which flow through to earnings increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in retail rates ($7 million) and an increase in retail sales volumes ($3 million).  The non-earnings components increase of $131 million is primarily due to the pass through of higher energy supply costs ($87 million), CL&P FMCC charges ($45 million), and higher wholesale revenues ($11 million), partially offset by lower CL&P conservation and load management cost recoveries ($5 million) and lower transition cost recoveries for CL&P and WMECO ($4 million).  
The higher gas distribution revenue of $16 million is primarily due to the increased recovery of gas costs ($13 million).
Transmission revenues increased $12 million in the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to the incremental recovery of 2004 expenses as allowed under FERC Tariff Schedule 21, a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses.
The NU Enterprises' revenue decrease of $121 million is primarily due to the mark-to-mark accounting for certain wholesale contracts related to the business to be exited.  As a result of that change, receipts under those contracts are netted with expenses to serve those contracts and recorded in fuel, purchased and net interchange power resulting in reduced revenues by approximately $290 million.  Additionally, revenues are lower primarily due to the wholesale marketing business ($38 million), partially offset by higher revenues from the merchant retail business ($51 million) and higher third party volumes ($155 million).  
Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power
Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expense increased $25 million in the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to higher purchased power costs for the Utility Group ($260 million), partially offset by lower wholesale costs at NU Enterprises ($235 million).  The $260 million increase for the Utility Group is due to an increase for CL&P and WMECO ($228 million) resulting primarily from an increase in standard offer supply costs, which includes higher third party supplier volume ($112 million), higher expenses for PSNH ($19 million) primarily due to higher energy and capacity purchases and higher Yankee Gas expenses ($13 million) primarily due to increased gas prices.
Other Operation
Other operation expenses increased $24 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher CL&P RMR costs and other power pool related expenses ($19 million) and higher expenses for NU Enterprises ($4 million).  
Wholesale Contract Market Changes, Net
See Note 2, "Wholesale Contract Market Changes," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description and explanation of these amounts.
Restructuring and Impairment Charges
See Note 3, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Assets Held for Sale," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description and explanation of these charges.
Maintenance
Maintenance expenses increased $7 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher overhead ($2 million) and underground ($1 million) line maintenance, higher substation maintenance expenses ($1 million), higher tree trimming expense ($1 million) and higher transmission expenses ($1 million).
Depreciation
Depreciation increased $3 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher CL&P plant balances.
Amortization
Amortization decreased $4 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to lower Utility Group recovery of stranded costs.
Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds
Amortization of rate reduction bonds increased $3 million in the second quarter of 2005 due to the repayment of a higher principal amount as compared to 2004.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased $9 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to the issuance of $280 million of ten-year and thirty-year first mortgage bonds at CL&P in September 2004, higher interest related to the final decision on the streetlight refund docket, and higher interest rates for NU parent.
 
Other Income, Net
Other income, net increased $5 million in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to higher interest and dividend income ($3 million) and a gain on the sale of land by HWP ($1 million).
 
Income Tax (Benefit)/Expense
Second quarter income tax expense decreased $35 million primarily due to lower income before tax expense and lower New Hampshire income taxes resulting from lower unitary taxable income.
 
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the operations of SESI, SECI-NH, Woods Network and Woods Electrical were presented as discontinued operations as a result of meeting certain criteria requiring this presentation.  Under this presentation, revenues and expenses of these businesses are included in the loss income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income.  See Note 12, "Subsequent Events," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.
Comparison of the First Six Months of 2005 to the First Six Months of 2004
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues increased $480 million in the first six months of 2005, compared with the same period in 2004, due to higher electric distribution revenues ($257 million), higher revenues from NU Enterprises ($168 million), higher gas distribution revenues ($40 million), and higher regulated transmission revenues ($17 million).  
The electric distribution revenue increase of $257 million is primarily due to non-earnings components of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail rates ($236 million).  The distribution component of these companies and the retail transmission component of CL&P and PSNH which flow through to earnings increased $21 million primarily due to an increase in retail rates ($19 million) and an increase in retail sales volumes ($1 million).  The non-earnings components increase of $236 million is primarily due to the pass through of higher energy supply costs ($177 million), CL&P FMCC charges ($81 million) and higher wholesale revenues ($3 million), partially offset by lower CL&P conservation and load management cost recoveries ($12 million) and lower transition cost recoveries for CL&P and WMECO ($8 million).  
The NU Enterprises' revenue increase of $168 million is primarily due to additional third party volumes ($331 million) and higher revenues from the merchantretail energy business ($120 million), partially offset by lower revenues from the mark-to-market accounting for certain wholesale contracts related to the business to be exited ($290 million) and higher revenues from the services businesses ($5 million).  
The higher gas distribution revenue of $40 million is primarily due to the increased recovery of gas costs ($33 million).
Transmission revenues increased $17 million in the first six months of 2005, primarily due to the incremental recovery of 2004 expenses as allowed under FERC Tariff Schedule 21, a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses.
Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power
Fuel, purchased and net interchange power expense increased $473 million in the first six months of 2005, primarily due to higher purchased power costs for the Utility Group ($552 million), partially offset by lower wholesale costs at NU Enterprises ($79 million).  The $552 million increase for the Utility Group is due to an increase for CL&P and WMECO ($476 million) resulting primarily from an increase in standard offer supply costs, which includes higher third party supplier volume ($272 million), higher expenses for PSNH ($44 million) primarily due to higher energy and capacity purchases and higher Yankee Gas expenses ($33 million) primarily due to increased gas prices.
Other Operation
Other operation expenses increased $63 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to higher CL&P RMR costs and other power pool related expenses ($40 million) and higher expenses for NU Enterprises ($16 million).  
Wholesale Contract Market Changes, Net

Restructuring and Impairment Charges
See Note 3, "Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Assets Held for Sale," to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description and explanation of these charges.
Maintenance
Maintenance expenses increased $7 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to higher overhead ($4 million) and underground ($2 million) line maintenance.
Depreciation
Depreciation increased $6 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to higher CL&P plant balances.
Amortization
Amortization decreased $10 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to lower Utility Group recovery of stranded costs.
Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds
Amortization of rate reduction bonds increased $6 million in the first six months of 2005 due to the repayment of a higher principal amount as compared to 2004.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased $14 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to the issuance of $280 million of ten-year and thirty-year first mortgage bonds at CL&P in September 2004, higher interest related to the final decision on the streetlight refund docket, and higher interest rates for NU parent.
 
Other Income, Net
Other income, net increased $5 million in the first six months of 2005 primarily due to higher interest and dividend income ($3 million) and a gain on the sale of land by HWP ($1 million).
Income Tax (Benefit)/Expense
Income tax expense decreased $135 million primarily due to lower income before tax expense.
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
