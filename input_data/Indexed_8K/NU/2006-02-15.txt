News Release
NU REPORTS 2005 RESULTS, CITES PROGRESS IN EXECUTING STRATEGIC PLAN
Regulated Transmission, Distribution and Generation Businesses Performed Well in Fourth Quarter, Full Year 2005
Strong Progress in Build-Out of Regulated Assets, Divestiture of Competitive Businesses
2005 Consolidated Results Primarily Reflect Losses in Wholesale Marketing Business Being Divested
2006 Combined Earnings Guidance Reaffirmed for Regulated Businesses, Parent
Northeast Utilities (NU-NYSE) today released year-end 2005 results and reported on the progress made on its strategic plan to transform the company.  That plan focuses on the company's regulated transmission, distribution and generation operations, while pursuing the exit from the company's competitive energy businesses.  NU also reaffirmed its combined 2006 earnings guidance for its regulated subsidiaries and parent company.
BERLIN, Connecticut, February 15, 2006
"2005 was a year when critical decisions were made affecting our company," said Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president and chief executive officer.  "We announced and began implementing our strategic plan and received siting authority to build several major transmission projects in southwest Connecticut.  In 2006, we will continue to divest our competitive businesses and invest more heavily in the construction of vital transmission infrastructure improvements in southwest Connecticut.  We believe this strategy, when successfully implemented, will result in compounded annual earnings per share growth of between 8 and 10 percent beginning in 2007."
Shivery noted that two of NU's major capital projects are on schedule for completion in 2006 and a third is due for completion in 2007.  The Connecticut Light and Power Company's (CL&P) $350 million 345-kV transmission line between
Bethel and Norwalk, Connecticut is nearly 70 percent complete.  Public Service Company of New Hampshire's (PSNH) Northern Wood Power Project, involving conversion of a 50-megawatt coal-fired unit in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to burn wood chips, is nearly 90 percent complete.  Both are due to be operational later this year.
Yankee Gas Service Company's' $108 million 1.2 bcf natural gas storage facility in Waterbury, Connecticut is about 44 percent complete with a target of a mid-2007 completion date.  Additionally, CL&P expects to begin construction of a 69-mile 345-kV transmission project between Middletown and Norwalk, Connecticut by mid-year 2006.  CL&P's share of that project is expected to cost approximately $1.05 billion.  Shivery said the projects are critical to improving energy service reliability for customers.
Shivery noted that NU Enterprises, Inc. (NUEI), the holding company for NU's competitive businesses, made significant progress in 2005 in completing the divestiture of its business operations.  All New England wholesale obligations were divested, almost half of its energy service companies were sold, and the process to sell its competitive generation and retail marketing businesses was initiated.
With respect to the retail marketing and generation businesses, Shivery said that, "We are encouraged by the progress and the feedback we have received from the market and expect to complete the divestiture of these operations this year."
Earnings guidance
NU today reaffirmed its 2006 combined earnings guidance for its regulated businesses and parent company of between $1.09 per share and $1.22 per share.  That range incorporates the issuance of an additional 23 million NU shares completed on December 12, 2005.
Full-year and fourth-quarter 2005 results
NU's regulated businesses earned $163.4 million in 2005, or $1.24 per share, compared with earnings of $155.6 million, or $1.21 per share, in 2004.  The 2005 results include earnings of $42.5 million, or $0.32 per share in NU's electric transmission business, compared with earnings of $29.5 million, or $0.23 per share, in 2004.  NU's electric and natural gas distribution businesses and regulated generation earned $120.9 million in 2005, or $0.92 per share, compared with earnings of $126.1 million, or $0.98 per share, in 2004.
In 2005, NU parent and other expenses, including write-downs, were $18.7 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with parent and other expenses, including write-downs, of $23.9 million, or $0.18 per share, in 2004.  
NU's competitive energy businesses, which the company is divesting, lost $398.2 million, or $3.03 per share, in 2005, primarily as a result of the marking to market and terminating wholesale electricity contracts, as well as various
impairments and restructuring charges.  Those businesses lost $15.1 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2004.
Overall, NU lost $253.5 million in 2005, or $1.93 per share, compared with earnings of $116.6 million, or $0.91 per share, in 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, NU's regulated companies earned $49.1 million, or $0.36 per share, including one-time employee termination and benefit plan curtailment charges of $12.3 million after-tax, compared with earnings of $37.2 million, or $0.29 per share, in the same period of 2004.  Parent company and other expenses totaled $8.6 million, or $0.07 per share, including $3.8 million of write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with parent company and other expenses of $9.2 million, or $0.07 per share, including $4.9 million of write-downs in 2004.  NU's competitive businesses lost $54.1 million, or $0.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $5.1 million, or $0.04 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Overall, NU lost $13.6 million, or $0.10 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $33.1 million, or $0. 26 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004.  
Regulated businesses
CL&P earned $89.3 million in 2005 and $27.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, after payment of preferred dividends, compared with earnings of $82.5 million in 2004 and $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The improved 2005 results, which include $8.5 million of after-tax termination costs and benefit plan curtailment charges, were due primarily to higher electric transmission business earnings resulting from increased investment in CL&P's transmission system.  
PSNH earned $41.7 million in 2005 and $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $46.6 million in 2004 and $10.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Lower 2005 full-year results were due primarily to higher operation and maintenance costs.
 
Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) earned $15.1 million in 2005 and $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $12.4 million in 2004 and $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Improved full year results were due primarily to a $6 million distribution rate increase that took effect January 1, 2005.
Yankee Gas earned $17.3 million in 2005 and $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with earnings of $14.1 million in 2004 and $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Higher earnings were due primarily to a $14 million distribution rate increase that took effect January 1, 2005.
In 2005, regulated electric sales grew 2.6 percent, compared with 2004 levels, but were down 0.1 percent on a weather-adjusted basis.  Shivery said the company continues to watch sales levels closely and is concerned that higher electric and natural gas rates, driven by higher fuel costs, may restrain sales growth at NU's distribution companies in 2006.  
Competitive businesses
NU's four competitive businesses, all of which are slated for divestiture, include retail marketing, wholesale marketing, energy services, and competitive generation.  To date, NU has sold two of its energy services businesses and portions of a third for $8.5 million and divested all of its New England wholesale contracts.  NU's financial adviser in the divestiture of its competitive generation and retail marketing businesses, J. P. Morgan Securities, has issued offering documents to bidders on the retail business and expects to issue offering documents on the competitive generation business later this quarter.  NU expects to close on the retail marketing business by mid-year and the generation business by the end of 2006.
The vast majority of the losses in the competitive businesses$278.9 million of $398.2 millionwere due to marking to market and divesting the wholesale energy contracts of Select Energy, Inc., NUEI's energy marketing subsidiary.  Exclusive of mark-to-market impacts, the wholesale marketing group lost $41.9 million after-tax in 2005 and $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of heavier than expected loads that required NUEI to purchase additional energy supplies at higher than projected price levels.  Also exclusive of charges related to wholesale supply, the retail marketing business earned $6.3 million in 2005, compared with $4.9 million in 2004.  Exclusive of impairment charges and discontinued operations, the energy services business lost $4.0 million in 2005, compared with a loss of $1.4 million in 2004.
