Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Non-Qualified Make-Whole Benefit Approved.  On May 25, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities approved the provision of a non-qualified benefit for the Named Executive Officers named in Northeast Utilities' 2006 Proxy Statement, and certain other officers of Northeast Utilities, The Connecticut Light and Power Company, Western Massachusetts Electric Company and Public Service Company of New Hampshire (collectively, the "Company"), and directed management to implement this benefit through an amendment to the Northeast Utilities Deferred Compensation Plan for Executives.  The benefit, called the K-Vantage Make-Whole Benefit, is available to officers hired after 2005 and current officers who choose to participate in the benefit and forego additional benefit accruals under the Northeast Utilities Retirement Plan.  The K-Vantage Make-Whole Benefit supplements the qualif ied benefit provided to officers who are eligible for a Company contribution provided under the Northeast Utilities Service Company 401k Plan.  This contribution is based on age and service, but compensation limits applicable to qualified plans under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code effectively cap the amount the Company can contribute.  The K-Vantage Make-Whole Benefit, which is subject to five-year vesting, equals the contribution that the officer would have received but for these limits.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalves by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
