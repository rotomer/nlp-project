Item 8.01 Other Events
On June 15, 2006, Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) filed a settlement with several parties concerning its application with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) for a temporary increase in energy delivery rates, effective July 1, 2006.  Parties to the settlement included NHPUC Staff, the state Office of Consumer Advocate, the state Office of Energy and Planning, and several small power producers that sell their output to PSNH.
Under the proposed settlement of temporary rates, PSNH would be allowed to raise its energy delivery rates by $24.5 million on an annualized basis.  The temporary increase would remain in effect until a final NHPUC decision takes effect concerning an application PSNH filed May 30, 2006 to raise energy delivery rates by $49 million annually.  PSNH expects the full rate case to be decided in 2007.  Should the settlement be approved by the NHPUC, revenues collected while the temporary rates are in effect will be reconciled to the final decision on permanent rates.  
Under the settlement, PSNH would be allowed a $15 million increase in temporary rates to improve its return on rate base, an $8 million increase to recover increased transmission expense, and a $1.5 million increase in first quarter 2006 state income tax expense.  PSNH expects that those increases would be much more than offset by significant decreases in PSNH's energy and stranded cost recovery charges, if the NHPUC also approves those changes effective July 1, 2006.  If all proposed changes are approved by the NHPUC, average PSNH customer bills would decline by approximately 12.8 percent in July 2006.
