Item 1.02   
Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 29, 2006, Northeast Utilities ("NU") terminated its 364-day, $600 million Credit Agreement, by and among NU, the Banks named therein, Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), as Administrative Agent, and Barclays, as Fronting Bank (the "Credit Agreement").  NU's current financial position no longer requires the additional liquidity provided by the Credit Agreement.  There were no termination penalties incurred by NU as a result of the termination.
The Credit Agreement was a 364-day, revolving credit facility dated as of November 2, 2005. The original $600 million commitment under the Credit Agreement was reduced by NU to $310 million in December 2005, but no borrowings were ever made under this facility.
The lenders under the Credit Agreement, Barclays, Citicorp USA, Inc. ("Citicorp") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., are also among the lenders under NU's 5-year $700 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 9, 2005, and the 5-year $400 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with NU's principal subsidiaries, The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), Public Service Company of New Hampshire, Western Massachusetts Electric Company and Yankee Gas Services Company dated as of December 9, 2005.
In addition, CL&P and a subsidiary of CL&P are parties to an arrangement under which the subsidiary can sell up to $100 million of an undivided interest in CL&P's accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to an affiliate of Citicorp.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant
has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date:  July 5, 2006
