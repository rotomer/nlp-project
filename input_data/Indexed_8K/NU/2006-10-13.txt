Item 8.01
Other Events
In 1998, Yankee Atomic Electric Company ("YAEC"), Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company ("CYAPC"), and Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company ("MYAPC") filed separate complaints against the United States Department of Energy ("DOE") in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal no later than January 31, 1998 pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee companies and the DOE. In decisions later that year, the court found liability on the part of the DOE to the Yankee companies for breach of the standard contract, based upon the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal, and directed plaintiffs to seek monetary damages in the Court of Federal Claims.
In 2004, a separate trial was conducted in the Court of Federal Claims in which the Yankee companies initially claimed aggregate damages estimated at between $523 million and $543 million for incremental spent nuclear fuel storage, security, construction and other costs through 2010.
Consistent with precedent set in another case, the Court subsequently limited damages to actual damages incurred.  In a ruling released October 4, 2006, the Court held that the DOE was liable for damages to YAEC for $32.9 million through 2001, CYAPC for $34.2 million through 2001, and MYAPC for $75.8 million through 2002.  The Yankee companies had claimed actual damages through the same period as follows: YAEC: $60.8 million; CYAPC: $37.7 million; and MYAPC: $78.1 million.  Most of the reduction in the claimed losses related to disallowed wet pool operating expenses.  The Court felt the Yankee companies would have incurred the disallowed expenses notwithstanding the DOE breach given the DOE's probable rate of acceptance of spent nuclear fuel had a depository been available.
The Yankee companies believe they will have the opportunity in future lawsuits to recover more damages incurred in years after 2001/2002.  The Yankee companies expect the DOE to appeal the decision and are themselves still evaluating whether to appeal.  The application of any damages which are ultimately recovered to benefit customers is established in the Yankee companies' Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved rate settlement agreements, although implementation will be subject to the final determination of the FERC.
Northeast Utilities' ("NU") electric operating subsidiaries collectively own 38.5% of YAEC, 49% of CYAPC and 20% of MYAPC, and their aggregate share of the damages would be $44.7 million.  Their respective shares of the damages would be as follows: The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"): $29.0 million; Western Massachusetts Electric Company ("WMECO"): $7.9 million; and Public Service Company of New Hampshire ("PSNH"): $7.8 million.  CL&P, WMECO and PSNH cannot at this time determine the timing or amount of any ultimate recovery or the credit to future storage costs that may be realized in connection with this matter.
