News Release
 
NU REPORTS ON THIRD QUARTER 2006 RESULTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, 2007 EARNINGS GUIDANCE, COMPETITIVE GENERATION SALE
NU Reports Third-Quarter Earnings of $0.72 Per Share
NU Expects To Invest Nearly $4.9 Billion in Regulated Infrastructure from 2007 Through 2011
NU Sets 2007 Consolidated Earnings Guidance at $1.30-$1.55 Per Share
NU Nets $1 Billion from Sale of Competitive Generation
Northeast Utilities (NU-NYSE) today provided a new five-year estimate for its investments in New England's energy infrastructure, established a 2007 projected earnings range, reported on the cash impact of its recent competitive generation sale, and released 2006 third-quarter results.
BERLIN, Connecticut, November 6, 2006
NU earned $111.5 million, or $0.72 per share, in the third quarter of 2006, compared with a loss of $94.5 million, or $0.73 per share, in the third quarter of 2005. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, NU earned $123.6 million, or $0.80 per share, compared with a loss of $239.9 million, or $1.85 per share, in the same period of 2005. Results for 2006 include a third-quarter reduction of income tax expense of $74 million, or $0.48 per share, that is detailed below.
"Our announcements today demonstrate that we are successfully executing the strategic plan we announced a year ago," said Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president, and chief executive officer. "We have substantially exited our competitive businesses and are building much of the energy infrastructure New England needs, while providing shareholders with an attractive total return on the dollars they have entrusted to us."
On November 1, 2006, NU closed on the sale of 1,442 megawatts of generation in Massachusetts and Connecticut to Energy Capital Partners, a private equity firm. After accounting for debt and transactional expenses, NU received approximately $1 billion, which it will use to invest in its regulated businesses, retire debt, and pay taxes related to the sale. NU will record an after-tax gain of approximately $300 million, or $1.95 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the sale.
Shivery noted that NU's major regulated business capital projects continue to progress well:

Shivery said NU's capital expenditures totaled $665 million over the first nine months of 2006 and are expected to total approximately $925 million for the entire year. NU's regulated capital expenditures are projected to be nearly $4.9 billion from 2007 through 2011, including approximately $1.2 billion in 2007. "The facilities we are building will help us meet the increasing demands for energy reliability of New England," Shivery said.
2006 Earnings Guidance
NU today affirmed its 2006 earnings guidance for its regulated businesses and parent company and continues to project 2006 combined earnings for its regulated businesses and parent company of between $1.57 per share and $1.70 per share. NU projects transmission business earnings to be within its previously announced earnings range of between $0.34 per share and $0.37 per share. NU projects earnings at its regulated distribution and generating companies to be at the low end or slightly below its previously announced range of between $1.23 per share and $1.33 per share, including the one-time reduction in CL&P's income tax expense noted earlier and detailed below. NU also expects parent results to be at or above breakeven.
NU is not providing 2006 earnings guidance for its competitive businesses, which the company continues to exit.
2007 Earnings Guidance
NU today issued consolidated 2007 earnings guidance of between $1.30 per share and $1.55 per share. NU projects 2007 earnings at its distribution and regulated generation businesses of between $0.80 per share and $0.90 per share. NU projects transmission business earnings of between $0.50 per share and $0.60 per share in 2007 and parent company results of between breakeven and earnings of $0.05 per share. NU also projects approximately breakeven results at its remaining competitive businesses in 2007, excluding the impact of marking to market its rapidly decreasing level of wholesale electricity commitments.
While NU is not providing specific earnings guidance beyond 2007, Shivery said that largely due to its regulated capital investment program, NU expects earnings per share to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 10 percent and 14 percent from 2006 through 2011, excluding the 2006 impact of the lower tax expense.
Consolidated Third Quarter Results
Shivery said NU's improved results in 2006 were due primarily to the absence of charges NU recorded in 2005 as a result of the divestiture of its wholesale marketing and energy services businesses. Additionally, CL&P recorded a gain of $74 million, or $0.48 per share, in the third quarter of 2006 as a result of a one-time reduction of income tax expense related to a private letter ruling CL&P received earlier this year from the Internal Revenue Service. That reduction was related to the treatment of excess deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits related to generating plants that were sold by regulated utilities as a result of industry restructuring.

Including the effect of the private letter ruling, NU's four regulated utilities earned $105.9 million, or $0.69 per share, in the third quarter of 2006 and $194.0 million, or $1.26 per share, in the first nine months of 2006. Excluding the effect of the private letter ruling, they earned $31.9 million, or $0.21 per share, in the third quarter of 2006 and $120.0 million, or $0.78 per share, in the first nine months of 2006. Those businesses earned $38.7 million, or $0.30 per share, in the third quarter of 2005 and $114.3 million, or $0.88 per share, in the first nine months of 2005.
NU Parent and other affiliates accounted for net income of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $3.3 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with losses of $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $10.1 million in the first nine months of 2005. Those improved results were due in part to increased investment income on cash raised in December 2005 when NU sold 23 million common shares.
Regulated Business Results
The transmission segments of NU's three electric companies earned $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $43.6 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $30.5 million in the first nine months of 2005. Increased earnings were primarily a result of a higher level of investment, particularly in Connecticut.
NU's regulated electric and natural gas distribution and electric generation business earned $87.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $150.4 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $26.9 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $83.8 million in the first nine months of 2005.
CL&P's distribution business earned $84.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $114.2 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $16.9 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $40.9 million in the first nine months of 2005. Absent the impact of the aforementioned reduction in income tax expense, CL&P's distribution business would have earned $10.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $40.2 million in the first nine months of 2006. Higher distribution rates in 2006 have been more than offset by lower sales, higher storm-related expenses, and higher interest costs, compared with 2005.
PSNH's distribution and generation business earned $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $21.2 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $24.0 million in the first nine months of 2005. The lower results were due primarily to a higher effective tax rate.
Western Massachusetts Electric Company's (WMECO) distribution business earned $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $8.6 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $8.6 million in the first nine months of 2005. The lower quarterly results were due to higher expenses and lower retail sales, partially offset by a $3 million annualized distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2006.
Yankee Gas lost $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2006 and earned $6.4 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2005 and earnings of $10.3 million in the first nine months of 2005. Yankee Gas year-to-date earnings were lower due primarily to a 9.3 percent decline in firm sales in the first nine months of 2006, compared with the same period of 2005. The decline was primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter of 2006, compared with the first quarter of 2005.
Shivery said 2006 regulated sales were also reduced by milder summer and winter weather, compared with 2005, and lower use due to apparent customer reaction to higher energy prices. Overall, retail electric sales were down 3.6 percent through the first nine months of 2006, compared with 2005, with residential sales off 4.9 percent, commercial sales off 2.0 percent and industrial sales down 4.0 percent. On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales were down 1.1 percent in the first nine months of 2006, compared with the same period of 2005. In the third quarter of 2006, retail electric sales were down 4.5 percent from the same period of 2005 and 1.8 percent on a weather-adjusted basis.

Competitive Business Results
NU's competitive energy businesses, which the company is divesting, earned $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2006 and lost $73.7 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared with losses of $129.6 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $344.1 million in the first nine months of 2005. The reduced level of losses was due primarily to a much lower impact in 2006 of marking to market wholesale electricity contracts, as well as a lower level of impairments and restructuring charges.
The following table reconciles 2006 and 2005 third-quarter and first nine month results.
 
Financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 and 2005 for NU's regulated and competitive businesses are noted below:
