At the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Northeast Utilities (the "Company") held on May 8, 2007, the Company's shareholders approved the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "Plan").  The Plan was adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Trustees (the "Board") on February 13, 2007, upon delegation of authority from the Board, subject to shareholder approval, and became effective upon such approval on May 8, 2007.  As approved, the Plan replaces the former Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan and provides for the issuance of up to 4,500,000 shares of Northeast Utilities common shares over a ten-year period.  The Plan has been designed to comply with the qualified performance-based compensation requirements under Internal Revenue Code ( the "Code") Section 162 (m).  That Code section requires shareholder approval of performance measures used in incentive compensation plans so that Northeast Utilities can deduct for income tax purposes all performance-based compensation.  
The material amendments to the former Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan include:
elimination of the former plan's "evergreen" feature that allowed the number of shares available for equity grants each year to equal one percent of outstanding Northeast Utilities common shares as of the preceding December 31;
elimination of the option repricing feature of the former plan.  The amended plan will not permit option repricing without shareholder approval; and
inclusion of minimum vesting rules.  The amended plan provides for minimum vesting of three years for restricted shares and restricted share units and one year for options, except as determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board for non-employee Trustees, new hires, death, disability, retirement or change of control.
A more detailed description of the terms of the Plan can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement for the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders dated March 20, 2007 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, 2007 (the "Proxy Statement"), in the section entitled "Approval of the Amended Incentive Plan."  The foregoing summary and the summary contained in the Proxy Statement are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the Plan, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.

Exhibit 10
_______________________________
Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan
The purpose of the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to provide (i) designated employees of the Company (as hereinafter defined in Article X) and (ii) non-employee members of the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of Northeast Utilities, a Massachusetts business trust, ("NU") with the opportunity to receive annual incentive compensation and grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units and performance units.  The Company believes that the Plan will assist it in recruiting talented employees who will contribute materially to the growth of the Company, thereby benefiting NU's shareholders and aligning the economic interests of the participants with those of the shareholders.
For purposes of the Plan, definitions appear in the Plan and as set forth in Article XIV.
1.
.  The Plan shall be administered and interpreted by the Board's Compensation Committee, or the person or persons to which such committee delegates any of its functions under the Plan (the "Committee").  The Committee may consist of two or more persons appointed by the Board, all of whom shall be "outside directors" as defined under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and related Treasury regulations and "non-employee directors" as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.  Members of the Committee shall be "independent" as defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.  However, the Board may ratify or approve any grants as it deems appropriate or as are submitted by the Committee.

.  The Committee shall have the authority to amend or terminate the Plan as provided in Article XII.  The Committee shall have the sole authority to (i) establish, and review the Company's and the Grantee's, as defined below, performance against annual goals for purpose of the annual incentives to be distributed and determine the individuals to whom grants shall be made under the Plan, (ii) determine the type, size and terms of the grants to be made to each such individual, (iii) determine the time when the grants will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise or restriction period, including the criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability (iv) establish such rules and regulations or take such action as it deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan, including the delegation of day-to-day plan administration, and (v) deal with any other matters arising under the Plan.

Termination of Employment, Retirement, Disability or Death
(i)
Except as provided below, an Option may be exercised only while the Grantee is employed by, or providing service to, the Company as an Employee, a Contractor, or a member of the Board.  In the event that a Grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company then, unless the Committee deems otherwise, all outstanding Options will expire upon termination from employment or service with the Board for Cause, or any  other reason, including termination on account of "Retirement," "Disability," or death.  
(ii)
For purposes of this Plan and programs thereunder:
(A)
"Cause" shall mean, except to the extent specified otherwise by the Committee acting on behalf of the Company, (i) the Grantee's conviction of a felony, (ii) in the reasonable determination of the Committee, the Grantee's (x) commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement, or theft in connection with the Grantee's duties in the course of the Grantee's employment with the Company, (y) acts or omissions causing intentional, wrongful damage to the property of the Company or intentional and wrongful disclosure of confidential information of the Company, or (z) engaging in gross misconduct or gross negligence in the course of the Grantee's employment with the Company, or (iii) the Grantee's material breach of his or her obligations under any written agreement with the Company if such breach shall not have been remedied within 30 days after receiving written notice from the Committee specifying the d etails thereof.  For purposes of this Program, an act or omission on the part of a Grantee shall be deemed "intentional" only if it was not due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence and was done by Grantee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the act or omission was in the best interest of the Company.  In the event a Grantee's employment or service is terminated for cause, in addition to the immediate termination of all Grants, the Grantee shall automatically forfeit all shares underlying any exercised portion of an Option for which the Company has not yet delivered the share certificates, upon refund by the Company of the Exercise Price paid by the Grantee for such shares.

(C)
"Employed by, or provide service to, the Company" shall mean employment or service as an Employee, Contractor or member of the Board (so that, for purposes of exercising Options and SARs and satisfying conditions with respect to
Restricted Stock, RSUs and Performance Units, a Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated employment or service until the Grantee ceases to be an Employee, Contractor and member of the Board), unless the Committee determines otherwise.
(D)
"Retired" shall mean a termination of employment from the Company, other than for "Cause" on or after the earlier to occur of (x) attainment of age 65,  (y) eligibility for payments under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for Officers of  Northeast Utilities System Companies, or  employment-related agreement with the Company, or  (z) attainment of age 55 after completing at least ten years of vesting service under the Northeast Utilities Service Company 401k Plan.

(ii)
with the approval of the Committee, by delivering shares of Company Stock owned by the Grantee (including Company Stock acquired in connection with the exercise of an Option or Restricted Stock, as defined below, granted under this Plan, subject to such restrictions as the Committee deems appropriate including placing the same restrictions on the shares of Company Stock obtained through the exchange of the Restricted Stock) and having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise Price, or
(iii)
by such other method as the Committee may approve, including payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board.  The Grantee shall pay the Exercise Price and the amount of any withholding tax due at the time of exercise.

An Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to any person who is not an Employee of the Company.

.  During the Restriction Period, a Grantee may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the shares of Restricted Stock except to a Successor Grantee, as defined below.  The Committee may determine that the Company will issue certificates for shares of Restricted Stock, in which case each certificate for a share of Restricted Stock shall contain a legend giving appropriate notice of the restrictions in the Grant.  The Grantee shall be entitled to have the legend removed from the share certificate covering the shares subject to restrictions when all restrictions on such shares have lapsed.  The Committee may determine that the Company will not issue certificates for shares of Restricted Stock until all restrictions on such shares have lapsed, or that the Company will retain possession of certificates for shares of Restricted Stock un til all restrictions on such shares have lapsed.
Restrictions on Transfer and Legend on Share Certificate

At the end of the Restriction Period, subject to any deferral election that may be made or applied to the Grant pursuant to subsection (c) below, cash or shares or both shall be delivered to the Grantee (unless previously forfeited).  Restricted Share Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered during the Restriction Period.

The Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement if an Executive Employee's employment or Non-Employee Trustee's service with the Board ends on account of Retirement, termination without Cause, death or Disability or due to a Change of Control, as it deems appropriate.
Requirement of Employment or Service
(d)
.  The Committee may determine that a Grant Instrument with respect to Restricted Share Units may provide that the Grantee shall be entitled to receive as compensation from the Company dividend equivalents with respect thereto, in the form determined by the Committee from the effective date of the Grant Instrument through the earlier of (i) the date the Restricted Share Unit is forfeited, and (ii) the date Company Stock representing such Restricted Share Units or cash is delivered to the Grantee as provided herein.
Dividend Equivalents
(e)
.  The Committee may provide for the automatic deferral of the payment of Restricted Share Units upon the lapse of restrictions on the Grant or permit a Grantee to elect deferral by filing a written election with the Committee in accordance with such procedures as the Committee may from time to time specify.  Such deferral will extend until the date or dates specified in such election; provided, however, that any such deferral election shall be made in accordance with rules under Section 409A of the Code.
Deferrals of Restricted Share Units
3.
 The Company shall have the right to deduct from any settlement of a Grant of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units, including the delivery or vesting of shares or dividend equivalents, an amount sufficient to cover withholding required by law for any federal, state or local taxes or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy any withholding obligations.  The Committee may permit shares to be used to satisfy required tax withholding, and such shares shall be valued at the fair market value as of the settlement date of the applicable Grant.
Withholding.

Section 162(m)
1.
.
Stock Appreciation Rights
(a)
.  The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights ("SARs") to a Grantee separately or in tandem with any Option (for all or a portion of the applicable Option).  Tandem SARs may be granted either at the time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter while the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, SARs may be granted only at the time of the Grant of the Incentive Stock Option.  The Committee shall establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted.  The base amount of each SAR shall be equal to the per share Exercise Price of the related Option or, if there is no related Option, the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock as of the date of Grant of the SAR ("Base Amount").  The Committee may not modify the applicable Base Amount of the SAR after the date of Grant.
General Requirements
(b)
.  In the case of tandem SARs, the number of SARs granted to a Grantee that shall be exercisable during a specified period shall not exceed the number of shares of Company Stock that the Grantee may purchase upon the exercise of the related Option during such period.  Upon the exercise of an Option, the SARs relating to the Company Stock covered by such Option shall terminate.  Upon the exercise of SARs, the related Option shall terminate to the extent of an equal number of shares of Company Stock.
Tandem SARs
(c)
.  An SAR shall be exercisable during the period specified by the Committee in the Grant Instrument and shall be subject to such vesting and other restrictions as may be specified in the Grant Instrument.  SARs may only be exercised while the Grantee is employed by the Company or during the applicable period after termination of employment as described in Article IV, Section 3(e).  A tandem SAR shall be exercisable only during the period when the Option to which it is related is also exercisable.
Exercisability
(d)
.  When a Grantee exercises SARs, the Grantee shall receive in settlement of such SARs an amount equal to the "spread value" for the number of SARs exercised, payable in cash..  The "spread value" for an SAR is the amount representing the  difference by which the Fair Market Value of the underlying Company Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR exceeds the base amount of the SAR as described in Subsection (a).
Value of SARs
(e)
.   For purposes of calculating the amount of cash to be received, shares of Company Stock shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR and cash shall be distributed, net of applicable withholding taxes.  
Form of Payment
1.
.
Performance Units
(a)
.  The Committee may grant performance units ("Performance Units") to an Employee.  Each Performance Unit shall represent the right of the Grantee to receive an amount based on the value of the Performance Unit, if performance goals established by the Committee are met.  A Performance Unit shall be based on the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock or on such other measurement base as the Committee deems appropriate.  The Committee shall determine the number of Performance Units to be granted and the requirements applicable to such Units, subject to the limitations contained in Article IX.
General Requirements
(b)
.  When Performance Units are granted, the Committee shall establish the Performance Period during which performance shall be measured, Performance Goals applicable to the Units and such other conditions of the Grant as the Committee deems appropriate.  Performance Goals may relate to the financial performance of the Company or its operating units, the performance of Company Stock, individual performance, or such other criteria as the Committee deems appropriate.
Performance Period and Performance Goals
(c)
.  At the end of each Performance Period, the Committee shall determine to what extent the Performance Goals and other conditions of the Performance Units are met and the amount, if any, to be paid with respect to the Performance Units.  Payments with respect to Performance Units shall be made in cash, in Company Stock, or in a combination of the two, as determined by the Committee.
Payment with respect to Performance Units
(d)
.  If the Grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company (as defined in Article IV, Section 3(e))
Requirement of Employment or Service
during a Performance Period, or if other conditions established by the Committee are not met, the Grantee's Performance Units shall be forfeited.  The Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement if an Executive Employee's employment ends on account of Retirement, termination without Cause, death or Disability or due to a Change of Control, as it deems appropriate.
(e)
.  The Committee may determine that Performance Units granted to a Grantee shall be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.  The provisions of this subsection (e) shall apply to Grants of Performance Units that are to be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.  
Designation as Qualified Performance-Based Compensation
(i)
.  When Performance Units that are to be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" are Granted, the Committee shall establish in writing (i) the objective Performance Goals that must be met in order for amounts to be paid under the Performance Units, (ii) the Performance Period during which the performance goals must be met, (iii) the threshold, target and maximum amounts that may be paid if the Performance Goals are met, and (iv) any other conditions, including without limitation provisions relating to death, disability, other termination of employment or Change of Control, that the Committee deems appropriate and consistent with the Plan and Section 162(m) of the Code.  The performance goals may relate to the Employee's business unit or the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries as a whole, or any combination of the foregoing.
Performance Goals
(ii)
.  The Committee shall establish the Performance Goals in writing either before the beginning of the Performance Period or during a period ending no later than the earlier of (i) 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period or (ii) the date on which 25% of the Performance Period has been completed, or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code.  The performance goals shall satisfy the requirements for "qualified performance-based compensation," including the requirement that the achievement of the goals be substantially uncertain at the time they are established and that the goals be established in such a way that a third party with knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether and to what extent the performance goals have been met.  The Committee shall not have discretion to increase the amou nt of compensation that is payable upon achievement of the designated performance goals.
Establishment of Goals
(iii)
.  The number of Performance Units granted and paid in shares shall not exceed the limit specified under Article IX(1)(a).  If Performance Units are paid in cash, the maximum amount that may be paid to an Employee with respect to a Performance Period is $4,000,000.
Maximum Payment
(iv)
.  The Committee shall certify and announce the results for each Performance Period to all Grantees immediately following the announcement of the Company's financial results for the Performance Period.  If and to the extent that the Committee does not so certify that the performance goals have been met, the grants of Performance Units for the Performance Period shall be forfeited.

.  The aggregate number of common shares of NU, par value $5.00, ("Company Stock") that may be subject to Grants of Options, or transferred on account of other Grants or Awards under the Plan may not exceed 4.5 million shares.  The shares may be authorized but unissued shares of Company Stock or reacquired shares of Company Stock, including shares purchased by the Company on the open market for purposes of the Plan.  If and to the extent (i) Options or SARs granted under the Plan terminate, expire, or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without having been exercised (other than for reasons of the Exercise Price of the Option being less than the current Fair Market Value thereof), or (ii) any shares of Restricted Stock, RSUs or Performance Units are forfeited, or (iii) Company Stock, including RSUs, are used by the Participant to pay withholding taxes or as payment for the Exercise Price of the Grant, then the shares not made the subject of Grants and Awards, and the shares subject to such terminated, expired, canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered Grants and Awards shall again be available for purposes of the Plan in addition to the number of shares of Company Stock otherwise available for Grants and Awards.  No Participant under the Plan may receive aggregate Grants and Awards in excess of one million shares over the term of the Plan.
Shares Reserved for Grants and Awards
(b)
.  If there is any change in the number or kind of shares of Company Stock outstanding (i) by reason of a stock dividend, spinoff, recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) by reason of a merger, reorganization or consolidation in which NU is the surviving entity, (iii) by reason of a reclassification or change in par value, or (iv) by reason of any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding Company Stock as a class without NU's receipt of consideration, or (v) otherwise in the event of an equity restructuring within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), other than (x) any distribution of securities or other property by the Company to shareholders in a spin-off or split-off that does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off of split-up under Section 355 of the Code (or any successor provision of the Code) or (y) any cas h dividend (other than an extraordinary cash dividend or distribution), then the maximum number of shares of Company Stock available for Grants, the number of shares covered by outstanding Grants, the kind of shares issued under the Plan, and the price per share or the applicable market value of such Grants, including the per share exercise price of  Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of, or change in the kind or value of, issued shares of Company Stock to preclude, to the extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under such Grants; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated. Any increase to the  number or kind of shares of Company Stock outstanding under this Article IX(1)(b) occurring on or after May 9, 2007 shall result in the adjustment in the 4.5 million shares authorized under Article IX(1)(a).  No such a djustment shall be required to reflect the events described in clauses (x) and (y) above, or any other change in capitalization that does
Adjustments
not constitute an equity restructuring; however, such adjustment may be made if the Committee determines that such adjustment is appropriate.  Any adjustments determined by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.

The Committee may, in its discretion, determine such other vesting schedule as it deems appropriate, except that any such other vesting schedule must fulfill at least the applicable minimum requirements set forth in the prior two sentences.  The Committee may provide for complete or partial exceptions to these requirements as it deems appropriate in the case of a Participant whose service with the Company ends for reason of Retirement, Death, or Disability, or in the case of a Grant to a Non-Employee Trustee or a newly-hired Employee, or upon a Change of Control of NU.
Minimum Vesting Requirement
1.
.  All Grants under the Plan shall be subject to applicable federal (including FICA), state and local tax withholding requirements.  The Company shall have the right to deduct from all Grants paid in cash, or from other wages paid to the Grantee, any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such Grants.  In the case of Options and other Grants paid in Company Stock, the Company may require the Grantee or other person receiving such shares to pay to the Company the amount of any such taxes that the Company is required to withhold with respect to such Grants, or the Company may deduct from other wages paid by the Company the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such Grants.  If the Committee so permits, a Grantee may elect to satisfy the Company's income tax withholding obligation with respect to an Option, SAR, Restricted Stock, Restric ted Share Units or Performance Units that are paid in Company Stock, by having shares withheld up to an amount that does not exceed the Grantee's minimum applicable withholding tax rate for federal (including FICA), state and local tax liabilities.  The election must be in a form and manner prescribed by the Committee.

When a Grantee dies, the personal representative or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the Grantee ("Successor Grantee") may exercise such rights.  A Successor Grantee must furnish proof satisfactory to the Company of his or her right to
Nontransferability of Grants
receive the Grant under the Grantee's will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
(b)
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide, in a Grant Instrument, that a Grantee may transfer Nonqualified Stock Options to family members, one or more trusts for the benefit of family members, or one or more partnerships of which family members are the only partners, according to such terms as the Committee may determine; provided that the Grantee receives no consideration for the transfer of an Option and the transferred Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option immediately before the transfer.
Transfer of Nonqualified Stock Options
3.
.  No Company Stock shall be issued or transferred in connection with any Grant hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the issuance or transfer of such Company Stock have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Committee.  The Committee shall have the right to condition any Grant made to any Grantee hereunder on such Grantee's undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on his or her subsequent disposition of such shares of Company Stock as the Committee shall deem necessary or advisable as a result of any applicable law, regulation or official interpretation thereof, and certificates representing such shares may be legended to reflect any such restrictions.  Certificates representing shares of Company Stock issued or transferred under the Plan will be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as may be required by applicable laws, regulations and interpretations, including any requirement that a legend be placed thereon.
Requirements for Issuance or Transfer of Shares
4.
.  This Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any Grants under this Plan.  In no event shall interest be paid or accrued on any Grant, including unpaid installments of Grants.
Funding of the Plan
5.
.  Nothing in this Plan shall entitle any Employee or Non-Employee Trustee or other person to any claim or right to be granted a Grant under this Plan except as provided in Article V.  Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any individual any rights to be retained by or in the employ of the Company or any other employment rights, nor shall they interfere in any way with the right of the Company, a subsidiary or an affiliate to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time.
Rights of Participants
6.
.  No fractional shares of Company Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Grant.  The Committee shall determine whether cash, other awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

Change of Control of NU
As used herein, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred:
(i)
When any "person," as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), other than the Company, its affiliates, or any Company or NU employee benefit plan (including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee), is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of NU representing more than 20% of the combined voting power of either (i) the then outstanding common shares of NU (the "Outstanding Common Shares") or (ii) the then outstanding voting securities of NU entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Securities"); or
(ii)
Individuals who, as of the beginning of any twenty-four month period, constitute the Trustees (the "Incumbent Trustees") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Trustees or cease to be able to exercise the powers of the majority of the Trustees, provided that any individual becoming a trustee subsequent to the beginning of such period whose election or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the trustees then comprising the Incumbent Trustees shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Trustees, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the Trustees of NU (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act); or
(iii)
Consummation by NU of a reorganization, merger or consolidation (a "Business Combination"), in each case, with respect to which all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the respective beneficial owners of the Outstanding Common Shares and Voting Securities
immediately prior to such Business Combination do not, following consummation of all transactions intended to constitute part of such Business Combination, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 75% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation, business trust or other entity resulting from or being the surviving entity in such Business Combination in substantially the same proportion as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Common Shares and Voting Securities, as the case may be; or
(iv)
Consummation of a complete liquidation or dissolution of NU or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of NU other than to a corporation, business trust or other entity with respect to which, following consummation of all transactions intended to constitute part of such sale or disposition, more than 75% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, is then owned beneficially, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Common Shares and Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Outstanding Common Shares and Voting Securities, as the case may be, immediat ely prior to such sale or disposition.
2.
.
Consequences of a Change of Control
(a)
.  Upon a Change of Control, the Company shall provide each Grantee with outstanding Grants written notice of such Change of Control.
Notice
 
(b)
.  Upon a Change of Control where the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding Options and SARs that are not exercised and all outstanding restricted shares, restricted share units and Performance Units that are denominated in shares of Company Stock shall be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options, rights or entitlements by, the surviving corporation.
Assumption of Grants
(c)
.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to subsection (d) below, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may take any of the following actions: the Committee may (i) require that Grantees surrender their outstanding Options, SARs, restricted shares, restricted share units and Performance Units that are denominated in shares of Company Stock in exchange for a payment by the Company, in cash or Company Stock as determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the restricted shares, restricted share units or Performance Units (based on the then Fair Market Value of shares of Company Stock), or with respect to unexercised Options or SARs, in the amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Grantee's unexercised Options and SARs exceeds the Exercise Price of the Options or the base amount of the SARs, as applicable, or (ii) after giving Grantees an opportunity to exercise their outstanding Options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised Options and SARs at such time as the Committee deems appropriate.  Such surrender or termination shall
Other Alternatives
take place as of the date of the Change of Control or such other date as the Committee may specify.  
(d)
.  The Committee making the determinations under this Article XI, Section 2(d) following a Change of Control must comprise the same members as those on the Committee immediately before the Change of Control.  If the Committee members do not meet this requirement, the automatic provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply, and the Committee shall not have discretion to vary them.
Committee
(e)
.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee shall not have the right to take any actions described in the Plan (including without limitation actions described in Subsection (c) above) that would make the Change of Control ineligible for pooling of interests accounting treatment or that would make the Change of Control ineligible for desired tax treatment if, in the absence of such right, the Change of Control would qualify for such treatment and the Company intends to use such treatment with respect to the Change of Control.
Limitations
1.
.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a)
.  The Board or the Committee may amend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that neither the Board nor the Committee shall amend the Plan without shareholder approval if such approval is required by Sections 162(m) or 422 of the Code.
Amendment
(b)
.  The Plan shall terminate on the day preceding the tenth anniversary of its effective date, unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or the Committee, or is extended by the Board or the Committee with the approval of the shareholders.
Termination of the Plan
(c)
.  A termination or amendment of the Plan that occurs after a Grant is made shall not materially impair the rights of a Grantee unless the Grantee consents, unless the Committee acts under Article XI, Section 2(c), or unless the amendment or termination is required under statute, regulation, other law, or rule of a governing or administrative body having the effect of a statute or regulation.  The termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Committee with respect to an outstanding Grant.
Termination and Amendment of Outstanding Grants
(d)
.  The Plan shall be the controlling document.  No other statements, representations, explanatory materials or examples, oral or written, may amend the Plan in any manner.  The Plan shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Company and its successors and assigns.
Governing Document
1.
.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to (i) limit the right of the Committee to make Grants under this Plan in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants to employees thereof who become Employees of the Company, or for other proper corporate purposes, or (ii) limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or make other awards outside of this Plan.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another corporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries in substitution for a stock option or restricted stock grant made by such co rporation.  The terms and conditions of the substitute grants may vary from the terms and conditions required by the Plan and from those of the substituted stock incentives.  The Committee shall prescribe the provisions of the substitute grants.
Grants in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise
2.
.  The Plan, the exercise of Options and SARs and the obligations of the Company to issue or transfer shares of Company Stock under Grants shall be subject to all applicable laws and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required.  With respect to persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act.  In addition, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and applicable Grants under the Plan comply with the applicable provisions of sections 162(m) and 422 of the Code, and any other applicable law or regulation having the effect of law.  To the extent that any legal requirement of section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 162(m) or 422 of the Code as set forth in th e Plan ceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 162(m) or 422 of the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply.  The Committee may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation.  The Committee may also adopt rules regarding the withholding of taxes on payments to Grantees.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, agree to limit its authority under this Section.
Compliance with Law
3.
.  Any deferrals made under the Plan, including awards granted under the Plan that are considered to be deferred compensation, must satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code to avoid adverse tax consequences to participating employees.  These requirements include limitations on election timing, acceleration of payments, and distributions.  The Company intends to structure any deferrals and awards under the Plan to meet the applicable tax law requirements.
Deferred Compensation
4.
.  The Committee, either at the time of Grant or by subsequent amendment, may require or permit deferral of the payment of Awards or Grants under such rules and procedures as it may establish.
Payment of Awards
5.
.  Upon written demand of the Company, an Employee will reimburse or forfeit all or a portion of any Award or Grant paid to the Employee under the Plan where: (i) payment of the Award or Grant  was predicated on the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) in the judgment of the Board the Employee engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the substantial restatement, and (iii) a lower payment would have been made to the Employee based on the restated financial results.  In the event the Employee fails to make prompt reimbursement of any such Award or Grant previously paid or delivered, the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, deduct the amount required to be reimbursed from the Grantee's compensation otherwise due from the Company; pr ovided, however, that the Company will not seek to recover upon Awards or Grants paid more than three years prior to the date the applicable restatement is disclosed.

6.
.  The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of the Plan and Grant Instruments issued under the Plan shall exclusively be governed by and determined in accordance with the law of the State of Connecticut.
Governing Law
7.
.
