Other Events.
On June 4, 2007, "An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency" was signed by Connecticut Governor Rell.  Among other things, the law requires The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) and other Connecticut electric distribution companies to file plans in January 2008 to build cost of service peaking generation facilities and also requires the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) to allow Connecticut electric distribution companies to buy generation assets that are for sale, if it is in the public interest. In addition, under the law, Connecticut electric distribution companies are allowed to submit proposals to compete with independent power producer (IPP) developers for future identified generation needs, and will serve as builders of last resort.
The law also requires the DPUC to decouple electric and natural gas distribution revenues from sales volumes and institutes long-term integrated energy planning for Connecticut through utility filings with the Energy Advisory Board and the DPUC.
CL&P is reviewing this legislation and cannot at this time estimate its impact on the company.
