          (a)
Merrill Lynch Presentation
On September 25, 2007, Northeast Utilities ("NU") will give a slide show presentation at the Merrill Lynch Power & Gas Leaders Conference in New York, New York. The slides are attached hereto as Exhibit 99 ("Slide Presentation"), incorporated in this Item 7 by reference thereto and furnished pursuant to Regulation FD.
          (b)
Glenbrook Cables
The information contained in Slides 3, 6, 7, 8 and 16 from the Slide Presentation are deemed modified by the following.
          In October 2006, The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), a subsidiary of NU, began construction of a two cable, nine-mile, 115 KV transmission project between Norwalk, Connecticut and Stamford, Connecticut ("Glenbrook Cables"). The project is still scheduled to be placed in service in the second half of 2008. However, based on a current estimate of construction requirements, CL&P has increased the estimate for cost to complete Glenbrook Cables from $183 million to $223 million. CL&P's other two major southwest Connecticut transmission projects, the $1.05 billion Middletown-Norwalk project and the $72 million Long Island Replacement Cable project, remain on schedule and on budget.
          For further information, reference is made to Management's Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Business Developments and Capital Expenditures of NU's and CL&P's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2007.
          The information contained in this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99, shall not be deemed "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission nor incorporated by reference in any registration statement filed by NU, CL&P, Public Service Company of New Hampshire or Western Massachusetts Electric Company, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless otherwise specified.
          
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

New England States Are Increasing Their Renewable Portfolio Expectations
CT:  27% by 2020
VT:  2005-2012               Load growth to be met with renewables and capped at 10%.  (This is not a binding target, but a voluntary goal for adopting renewable energy.)
ME:  30% by 2000, additional 10% new resources by 2017.   Total is 40%.
NH:  23.8% by 2025
RI:  16% by 2019
MA:  4% in 2009; 1% annual increments resulting in 20% by 2020
12
Beyond 2010, a growing gap in meeting New England Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) is projected
17,269 GWh
2020
Decrease in percentage of existing renewables is due to growth in New England energy requirements
By 2020, there is a 17,000 GWh gap between existing renewable resources and RPS requirements

Meeting the RGGI Requirements Will Be Challenging Under Any Load Growth Scenario
Assuming current energy growth projections of 1.3% per year, by 2020 New England is projected to produce CO
2
emissions of nearly 74 million tons  about 24 million more than the RGGI cap
Lowering CO
2
emissions to meet RGGI requirements would require replacing about 36,000 GWh of existing CO
2
- emitting resources with low-emissions resources
This translates to about 5,000 MW of base load (80% capacity factor) low-emission generation
Even under a "zero" energy growth scenario, RGGI mandates reductions of about 10 million tons by 2020
This would require
replacing
about 12,000 GWh  -- 500 MW each of coal and oil and 1,200 MW of gas-fired generation, assuming shutdowns proportional to New England's current energy mix

Projected Summer Capacity Surplus/Deficiency in 2015
+2,800 MW
Long-term forecasts show a
summer
surplus of generation in the eastern provinces of Canada and insufficient summer generation in Ontario, New York, and New England.
Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador have identified over 21,000 MW of renewable power potential (7,000 MW of hydroelectric and 14,000 MW of wind).
This suggests there will be a growing need for transmission to move surplus energy from eastern Canada into New England.
It also suggests that Ontario and New York are also potential Buyers who will be competing with New England.
Eastern Canada Will  Become A Valuable Source To Meet New England's Needs
