News Release

$6 billion, five-year capital program to upgrade New England energy infrastructure announced
2007 consolidated earnings range raised to $1.45-$1.60 per share
2008 consolidated earnings guidance of $1.65-$1.95 per share announced
Northeast Utilities (NU: NYSE) today reported earnings for the third quarter of 2007 and provided an updated capital expenditure forecast from 2007 through 2012. NU also raised 2007 earnings guidance and initiated 2008 consolidated earnings guidance of between $1.65 per share and $1.95 per share.
BERLIN, Connecticut, November 5, 2007 
NU earned $50.2 million, or $0.32 per share, in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $37.5 million

, in the third quarter of 2006, excluding the impact of a one-time, $74 million reduction in income taxes in 2006 related to the sale of generating plants formerly owned by The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), NU's largest subsidiary. Including that one-time tax reduction, NU earned $111.5 million, or $0.72 per share, in the third quarter of 2006.
NU earned $173.8 million, or $1.12 per share, in the first nine months of 2007, compared with $49.6 million,

or $0.32 per share,

in the first nine months of 2006, excluding the one-time, $74 million tax reduction. Including the tax reduction, NU earned $123.6 million, or $0.80 per share, in the first nine months of 2006. Nine-month 2006 results include losses of $73.7 million at NU's competitive energy businesses, primarily related to charges at NU's former retail energy marketing business, which was sold in June 2006.
Charles W. Shivery, NU's chairman, president and chief executive officer, also attributed NU's improved operating results over the first nine months of 2007 to the impact of rate settlements for three of NU's four distribution utilities; higher regulated sales; and growth in the company's transmission segment, where the company is investing heavily to meet the regional energy needs of customers.
"Our focus on our regulated utilities continues to provide significant benefits to customers in the form of a more reliable New England energy infrastructure and lower congestion costs, and to investors in the form of more predictable earnings and dividend growth," Shivery said.

2007 and 2008 earnings guidance
NU today raised its 2007 earnings range to $1.45-$1.60 per share from $1.30-$1.55 per share. NU expects its distribution and generation segment to earn between $0.85 per share and $0.95 per share in 2007 and its transmission segment to earn between $0.50 per share and $0.55 per share. NU also expects earnings of approximately $0.05 per share at its parent company and service company affiliates and approximately $0.05 per share at its remaining competitive operations, excluding the effect of marking to market its remaining wholesale obligations. In the first nine months of 2007, marking those obligations to market resulted in a $2.8 million after-tax charge.
NU also today projected a 2008 consolidated earnings range of between $1.65 per share and $1.95 per share. That range includes projected distribution and generation earnings of between $1.10 per share and $1.25 per share, transmission earnings of between $0.70 per share and $0.80 per share, parent and other company losses of between $0.10 per share and $0.15 per share, and breakeven competitive business results, excluding the effect of marking to market its remaining wholesale energy obligations. Shivery said 2008 distribution results will be impacted by the outcome of the ongoing CL&P rate case in which a decision from state regulators is now scheduled for late next month.
Shivery said NU's 2008 earnings guidance is consistent with NU's previously estimated compounded five-year annual earnings per share growth rate of between 10 percent and 14 percent, with significantly higher growth projected for 2008 than in the later years. This growth rate assumes that the company meets the capital investment and rate base projections noted below and that it receives appropriate regulatory approvals and allowed returns and timely rate treatment for those investments.
Capital investment projections
Also today, NU released new five-year capital expenditure projections for the period of 2008 through 2012. During that period, NU expects to invest approximately $6 billion in New England's energy infrastructure, including $3 billion in its high-voltage electric transmission system, $2.5 billion in its electric and natural gas distribution system, and approximately $350 million on upgrades to the generation owned by Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH). Those expenditures are projected to increase NU's overall regulated rate base from approximately $5.4 billion at the end of 2007 to approximately $9.4 billion at the end of 2012.
"Regional energy planners continue to identify and we continue to construct transmission projects necessary to meet the reliability needs of the New England region and provide for the more efficient use of the region's generation," Shivery said. "For example, our $335 million, Bethel-Norwalk 345-kv transmission project has not only improved reliability in southwest Connecticut, it has also reduced congestion costs by more than $130 million since it entered service in October 2006."
2007 ResultsTransmission
NU's transmission segment earned $20.0 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $57.0 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $43.6 million in the first nine months of 2006. The increase in third quarter net income in 2007, compared with the same period of 2006, reflects a higher level of investment in NU's transmission facilities, partially offset by a $2 million charge related to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order concerning allowed transmission returns during a 15-month period ended in September 2006.
Shivery provided the following update on NU's major southwest Connecticut transmission projects:

NU's capital spending totaled $842.1 million in the first nine months of 2007, including $490.0 million on transmission. NU expects to invest nearly $1.3 billion in New England's energy infrastructure in 2007, including approximately $750 million in transmission.
Distribution and Generation
NU's distribution and generation segment earned $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $100.1 million in the first nine months of 2007. In the third quarter of 2006, the distribution and generation segment earned $13.7 million

, excluding the one-time reduction in tax expense related to the treatment of excess deferred income taxes and unamortized tax credits related to CL&P's former generating plants, and $87.7 million including it. For the first nine months of 2006, the distribution and generation segment earned $76.4 million,

excluding the reduction in tax expense and $150.4 million including it.
CL&P's distribution segment earned $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $44.3 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with earnings of $10.4 million
1
in the third quarter and $40.2 million

in the first nine months of 2006, excluding the one-time reduction in tax expense. Excluding the impact of the tax expense reduction, CL&P third-quarter distribution earnings increased $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared with the same period of 2006, reflecting lower storm and heat-related operating costs and a $7 million annualized rate increase, partially offset by the expiration of the procurement fee at the end of 2006 and higher interest expense. Including the reduction in tax expense, CL&P's distribution segment earned $84.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $114.2 million in the first nine months of 2006.
PSNH's distribution and generation segment earned $11.0 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $31.7 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with earnings of $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $21.2 million in the first nine months of 2006. Results in 2007 have benefited from the conclusion of PSNH's distribution rate case, with new rates becoming effective July 1, 2007, partially offset by higher operating expense.
Western Massachusetts Electric Company's (WMECO) distribution segment earned $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $13.6 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with earnings of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $8.6 million in the first three quarters of 2006. Improved 2007 results were due to the impact of WMECO's distribution rate settlement that took effect January 1, 2007.
Yankee Gas Services Company lost $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2007 and earned $10.5 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with a loss of $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2006 and a profit of $6.4 million in the first nine months of 2006. The improved year-to-date results were largely due to an 8.2 percent increase in firm sales resulting primarily from a colder heating season in 2007, compared with 2006, and a rate settlement that was effective July 1, 2007, partially offset by higher operating and interest expense.

Competitive businesses
NU Enterprises, Inc. (NUEI), the holding company for NU's competitive businesses, whose remaining contracts continue to expire or be closed out, earned $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2007 and earned $8.1 million in the first nine months of 2007, including the aforementioned $2.8 million charge, compared with earnings of $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2006 and losses of $73.7 million in the first nine months of 2006.
Parent and other NU subsidiaries
NU Parent and its service company affiliates earned $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $8.6 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared with earnings of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $3.3 million in the first nine months of 2006. Improved year-to-date results were due primarily to interest earned on cash the parent received from the November 2006 sale of NU's competitive generation some of which NU continued to hold through the first nine months of 2007.
NU has approximately 155 million common shares outstanding. It operates New England's largest energy delivery system, serving more than 2 million customers in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
