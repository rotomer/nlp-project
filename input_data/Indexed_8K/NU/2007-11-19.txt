On November 16, 2007, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control ("DPUC") granted the request of The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P") to extend the statutory deadline for acting on CL&P's distribution rate case application. The DPUC accordingly adjusted the schedule in the proceeding to provide for the issuance of a draft decision on January 16, 2008 and a final decision on January 28, 2008.  On November 7, 2007, CL&P had made its request so that it, the DPUC staff, the Connecticut Attorney General, the Office of Consumer Counsel and other parties would have sufficient time to engage in settlement discussions.
