Amendments to the Northeast Utilities Long-Term Incentive Programs
On December 11, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities (the "Company") approved amendments to the 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 Long-Term Incentive Programs (collectively, the "LTIPs") established under the Northeast Utilities Incentive Plan for officers of the Company.  In 2007, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated final regulations under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The LTIPs were amended to add provisions related to the timing of distributions following vesting and upon the termination of an officer's employment so that compensation payable under the LTIPs would satisfy these final regulations.
In addition, the 2004, 2005 and 2006 LTIPs were amended to eliminate the automatic deferred distribution of NU common shares upon vesting of restricted share units ("RSUs") granted under these programs. As a result, unless participants elect, not later than December 31, 2007, to continue deferred distribution of NU common shares upon vesting of RSUs granted under these programs: (i) NU common shares will be distributed on February 25, 2008 in respect of all RSUs that have vested (and for which the distribution of NU common shares is currently deferred), and (ii) NU common shares will be distributed immediately upon vesting of all RSUs that are scheduled to vest on or after February 25, 2008. The 2007 LTIP does not contain automatic deferred distribution provisions.
The Committee's action to eliminate the automatic deferred distribution of NU common shares upon vesting of RSUs does not apply to RSUs granted to our Chief Executive Officer under the 2005 and 2006 LTIPs. Accordingly, the distribution of NU common shares upon vesting of all RSUs granted to the CEO under these programs will continue to be deferred until the termination of his employment.

On December 11, 2007, the Compensation Committee also eliminated the automatic deferred distribution of NU common shares upon vesting of RSUs granted to members of the Company's Board of Trustees, except for Trustees who elect, not later than December 31, 2007, to continue the deferred distribution of NU common shares in accordance with the provisions of the original RSU grants.
