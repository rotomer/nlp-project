Item 8.01 Other Events
On January 18, 2008, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control ("DPUC") issued a Draft Decision (the "Draft") in the electric distribution rate case proceeding for The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), which CL&P had filed on July 30, 2007.  CL&P is a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities.
CL&P had requested increased distribution revenues of $189 million for 2008 (later revised to $182 million), and $21.9 million for 2009.  The Draft approves increased revenues of $70.3 million for 2008 and $22.5 million for 2009, which would result in an incremental increase over current distribution rates of 10.1% in 2008 (a 1.7% increase on a total rates basis) and 2.9% in 2009 (a 0.5% increase on a total rates basis).  
CL&P had requested a return on equity ("ROE") of 11%, and the Draft approves an ROE of 9.25%.  In addition, the Draft approves substantially all of CL&P's proposed capital budget of approximately $294 million for 2008 and $288 million for 2009.  
Connecticut Public Act 07-242 requires the DPUC to decouple distribution revenues from the volume of electricity sales ("decoupling") through rate design and related initiatives.  The DPUC did not approve CL&P's proposal to achieve decoupling using a "revenue per customer" adjustment mechanism.  Instead, the DPUC proposed that CL&P promote the goals of decoupling through a tiered rate design that uses customer amperage as a basis for the scale.
New 2008 rates are scheduled to take effect on February 1, 2008, and the 2009 increase will take effect on February 1, 2009.
Written exceptions are due on January 24, 2008, with oral arguments to be held on January 25, 2008.  A final decision is expected on January 28, 2008.
For further information on this matter, reference is made to Northeast Utilities' and CL&P's combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2007, under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Financial Condition and Business Analysis  Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters."
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
