This Amendment to Form 8-K is being filed to correct certain percentages in the original filing. The corrections made are in the second paragraph, changing ".09%" to "0.9%" and ".04%" to "0.4%".
On January 28, 2008, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control ("DPUC") issued its final decision (the "Decision") in the electric distribution rate case proceeding for The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), which CL&P had filed on July 30, 2007. CL&P is a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities ("NU"). The DPUC had issued a draft decision in the proceeding on January 18, 2008.
In its application, CL&P had requested increased distribution revenues of $189 million for 2008 (later revised to $182 million), and $21.9 million for 2009. The Decision approves increased revenues of $77.8 million for 2008 and $20.1 million for 2009, which would result in an incremental increase over current distribution rates of 11.7 % in 2008 (a 0.9 % increase on a total rates basis versus December 2007 rates) and 2.6% in 2009 (a 0.4% increase on a total rates basis versus February 2008 rates).
In its application, CL&P had requested a return on equity ("ROE") of 11%, the Decision approves an ROE of 9.4% and requires CL&P to continue the existing earnings sharing mechanism, which provides that ratepayers and shareholders will share equally in any earnings in excess of its allowed ROE. The Decision also approves substantially all of CL&P's proposed capital budget of approximately $294 million for 2008 and $288 million for 2009.
As required by Connecticut Public Act 07-242, "An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiencies" (Energy Efficiency Act), CL&P's rate case application included a proposal to implement distribution revenue decoupling from the volume of electricity sales. CL&P proposed using a revenue per customer tracking mechanism in its rate case filing. In lieu of this proposal, the DPUC authorized compliance with the decoupling provisions of the Energy Efficiency Act via rate design that includes greater fixed recovery of distribution revenue. As compared to previous tariffs, the Decision allows CL&P to recover proportionately greater revenue through the fixed Customer and Demand charges and proportionately less distribution revenue through the per kWh charges. The result of this rate design will leave CL&P's distribution revenue recovery less susceptible to changes in kWh sales and kWh usage per customer.
New 2008 rates are scheduled to take effect on February 1, 2008, and the 2009 increase will take effect on February 1, 2009.
NU expects to release year-end financial results the week of February 18, 2008.
