Other Events.
On May 13, 2008, Northeast Utilities (NU) stated that its representatives will meet with the Planning Advisory Committee of the New England Independent System Operator (ISO-New England) on May 19, 2008 to review updated plans for its previously announced transmission upgrade projects in Southern New England known as the New England East West Solution (NEEWS).  NU expects to undertake construction of portions of the NEEWS projects jointly with National Grid.  The projects are designed to improve the east-west transfer capability across New England; address reliability challenges in and around Springfield, Massachusetts and within Rhode Island; relieve interstate transfer capacity constraints among Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island; and relieve east-west transmission constraints within Connecticut.
NU expects to construct three major projects and several smaller projects as part of NEEWS through its subsidiaries, The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P) and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO).  CL&P and WMECO expect to invest a total of approximately $1.49 billion in these projects, compared with the previously estimated $1.4 billion.  Completion of all projects is currently projected for the end of 2013.  
The three major projects consist of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, the Interstate Reliability Project, and the Central Connecticut Reliability Project.  
The Greater Springfield Reliability Project is the largest project and is estimated to cost approximately $715 million, or nearly 50 percent of NU's total investment in the NEEWS projects.  That project includes construction of a new 345 kV transmission line from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecticut, upgrades to a number of overhead 115 kV lines, various substation upgrades, and construction of a new switching station in Springfield, Massachusetts.  WMECO's 115 kV Springfield Underground Cables project, previously estimated to cost $350 million, has been integrated into the Greater Springfield Reliability Project.
CL&P and WMECO expect to file applications with Connecticut and Massachusetts state siting authorities late in the third quarter of 2008 for the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, and siting approvals are expected to be received in late 2009 or early 2010 for construction to begin by the end of 2010.
NU's portion of the other two major projects, the Interstate Reliability Project and the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, would be constructed solely by CL&P and each respective portion is estimated to cost approximately $250 million and $315 million.  CL&P expects to file by the end of 2008 for approval to construct the Interstate Reliability Project, a 345 kV line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border, where it would connect with enhancements to transmission lines designed by National Grid.  CL&P expects to file for approval of the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, which is another 345 kV line to be built between Bloomfield, Connecticut and Watertown, Connecticut, in 2009.  
Included as part of the NEEWS projects are approximately $210 million of reliability related expenditures, many of which may be incurred in advance of the three major projects.  CL&P and WMECO expect to begin filing siting applications related to some of these expenditures later in 2008.
During the siting approval process, regulators may require changes in configuration to address local concerns which could increase construction costs beyond the current estimate of $1.49 billion.  The companies' current designs do not contemplate any underground 345 kV lines, and building these lines underground would increase total costs.  NU continues to estimate that its consolidated transmission capital expenditures will be approximately $3 billion from 2008 through 2012.
