Section 7 - Regulation FD
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On July 17, 2008, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted in favor of The Connecticut Light and Power Company's (CL&P) application to receive return on equity (ROE) incentives for CL&P's 69-mile Middletown, Connecticut to Norwalk, Connecticut transmission project (M-N Project) and an additional 50 basis point adder for the advanced technology aspects of the 24-mile underground portion of the line.  
On March 24, 2008, the FERC had issued an Order on Rehearing concerning the return on equity incentives for regional transmission projects of New England transmission owners in which it provided an additional 100 basis point ROE for projects "completed and on line" by December 31, 2008.  The order also stated that New England companies completing projects beyond that date would be required to make project-specific applications to FERC to qualify for additional incentives.  This order has been appealed to the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals by various state regulators.
The M-N Project is currently more than 90% complete but is not projected to be completely in service until after the cut-off date for incentives established by the FERC order.  CL&P's share of the M-N Project is estimated to cost $1.05 billion.  On May 16, 2008, CL&P filed an application with FERC to receive ROE incentives for the M-N Project, requesting a waiver of the December 31, 2008 cut-off date for the 100 basis point ROE adder.  Alternatively, CL&P demonstrated that it met all of FERC's requirements for an incentive ROE.  In addition to the 100 basis points, CL&P sought a 50 basis point adder for the advanced technology aspects of the 24-mile underground portion of the line, citing its uniquely long length of 345-kV cross-link polyethylene cable and its use of 345-kv variable shunt reactors, optical fiber for better cable monitoring, and innovative substation automation pack ages.
On July 17, 2008, FERC Commissioners voted in favor of the waiver and the additional 50 basis points for the underground portions of the project.  The 50 basis point adder will be limited to 46 basis points based on the present overall ROE limit established by FERC on March 31, 2008, resulting in a total ROE for the underground portion of the M-N Project of 13.1%.  The cost of the underground portions is estimated to be slightly less than half of CL&P's overall $1.05 billion cost.  Once all advanced technology equipment is in service, the technology adder will increase NU's annual earnings by approximately $1 million.  
Among other findings, FERC said that CL&P had met its incentive test requirements by demonstrating that: the M-N Project would clearly ensure reliability and reduce congestion; it is not routine; it is very large in scope; there were significant risks and challenges associated with the M-N Project; and the entire package of incentives is just and reasonable.  Parties have 30 days from the date of the order to seek rehearing from FERC.
