Other Events.
On November 17, 2008, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order granting certain incentives jointly sought by Northeast Utilities' (NU) FERC-regulated companies, including The Connecticut Light and Power Company and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (the NU Companies), and National Grid USA, for the substantial transmission upgrades associated with their proposed New England East-West Solutions (NEEWS) series of transmission projects.  The NEEWS projects include four interrelated projects across three states, and several related and necessary upgrades.  For the NU Companies, the NEEWS projects include the construction of new overhead 345 KV lines in Massachusetts and Connecticut as well as associated substation work, new switching stations and 115 KV rebuilds. In their application to the FERC, the NU Companies and National Grid USA had sought (1) an incentive return on equity (ROE) of 150 basis points; (2) inclu sion of 100 percent construction work in progress (CWIP) costs in rate base; and (3) recovery of 100 percent of prudently incurred costs if any portion of the NEEWS projects is abandoned for reasons beyond their control.  
In its order, the FERC granted the requested CWIP and abandonment incentives and, finding that these incentives reduced the overall risk of the NEEWS projects, granted a 125 basis point ROE adder in lieu of the 150 basis points sought, resulting in an overall ROE for the NEEWS projects of 12.89 percent. The NU Companies recently began the siting application process and expect the NEEWS projects to be completed and placed in service by the end of 2013.
For further information on NU's proposed transmission projects and related regulatory issues, please refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Transmission Rate Matters and FERC Regulatory Issues-FERC ROE Decision" in NU's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and NU's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June, 30 and September 30, 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
