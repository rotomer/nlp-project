Amendments to Northeast Utilities' Executive Employment Agreements
On December 9, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities (the "Company") approved the amendment of employment agreements (the "Agreements") for the following named executive officers identified in the Company's proxy statement for its 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders: Charles W. Shivery, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; David R. McHale, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company; Leon J. Olivier, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and Gregory B. Butler, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company (individually, an "NEO," and collectively, the "NEOs"). The amendments to the Agreements will become effective on January 1, 2009.
The Agreements are being amended primarily so that various provisions related to the form and timing of payments and allowable elections under the Agreements comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A").  These amendments are necessary to avoid the imposition on any NEO of an excise tax on any payment that is subject to Section 409A.  Certain other non-material changes are being made to clarify existing benefits.  None of these changes will result in an increase in compensation for the executives.
