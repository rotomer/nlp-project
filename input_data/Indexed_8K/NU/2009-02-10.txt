The Northeast Utilities (NYSE: NU) Board of Trustees today approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend.
BERLIN, Connecticut, February 10, 2009 
NU will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.2375 per share on March 31, 2009, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2009.  The new annualized rate of $0.95 per share represents an increase of $0.10 per share above the previous annualized rate of $0.85 per share.
Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president, and chief executive officer, said the increase is consistent with NU's announcement in November 2008 that in 2009 it would begin to target paying out to shareholders approximately 50 percent of its earnings in the form of common dividends.  NU continues to project earnings per share of between $1.80 and $2.00 in 2009.
"We believe this dividend policy will position us to effectively access capital so that we can continue making the necessary investments in New England's energy infrastructure to better serve our customers," Shivery said.  
Shivery added that going forward NU expects to revisit its dividend levels in the first quarter of each year.  From 2001 through 2008, increases in NU's dividends were considered in the second quarter.  As the company has stated previously, NU today reiterated that its ability to pay common dividends is subject to approval by its Board of Trustees and to expectations of its future earnings and cash flows.  
NU operates New England's largest utility system serving more than 2.1 million electric and natural gas customers in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
