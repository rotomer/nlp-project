(c)
               
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing (but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party under this subsection shall not relieve it from any liability which it otherwise might have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this subsection) and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party has not retained counsel within a reasonable period of time after the request by the indemnified party to do so. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(d)
              
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of each indemnifying party on the one hand and each indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares.  The relative fault of each indemnifying party on the one hand and each indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e)The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
               
pro rata
(f)The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
                
(g)The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the statements regarding delivery of shares by the Underwriters set forth in the last paragraph of text on the cover page and under the caption "Underwriting  Price Stabilization and Short Positions, of the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or any Marketing Materials.
               
9..  If, on any Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Shares that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in hereto bears to the total number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in hereto; , that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Shares on such Delivery Date if the total number of Shares that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of Shares to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of Shares that it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2 hereof.  If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Shares to be purchased on such Delivery Date.  If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the Shares that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to any Option Shares Delivery Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Company to sell, the Option Shares) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11 hereof.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

10.  The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Shares if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(i) through 7(k) hereof shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Shares for any reason permitted under this Agreement.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for Northeast Utilities, a voluntary association organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement dated March 16, 2009 (the "") between the above-named underwriters (the "") and the Company, under which the Underwriters have agreed to purchase from the Company an aggregate of 16,500,000 common shares, par value $5 per share, of the Company (the ""), and the Company has granted to the Underwriters an option to purchase an aggregate of 2,475,000 additional common shares of the Company (the "").  The Firm Shares, and the Option Shares if purchased, are hereinafter collectively called (the ""). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

Shares
The transactions contemplated by the Agreement are more fully described in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-141425) (the ""), filed with the Commission under the Securities Act, which includes a prospectus relating, among other things, to the public offering from time to time of an indeterminate number of common shares of the Company (the ""), including the Shares, and prospectus supplements specifically relating to the Shares filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the Securities Act (the "").
Registration Statement
Initial Prospectus
Prospectus Supplements
This opinion is furnished to the Underwriters at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 7(d) of the Agreement, and is being delivered concurrently with the delivery of the Shares in receipt of payment therefor.
We have examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Agreement, copies of the Declaration of Trust of the Company, as amended, and resolutions adopted by the Board of Trustees, the Pricing Committee of the Board of Trustees and the shareholders of the Company, each as certified by an Assistant Secretary of the Company, and certificates of officers of the Company covering various other matters.
We have also examined such other papers, documents and certificates and have made such investigations as to matters of fact and law as we have considered necessary in order to give the opinion set forth below.  In making such examination, we have assumed the authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals or certified copies, the accuracy of copies and the genuineness of signatures appearing thereon.  As to various questions of fact material to such opinion, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement.
We do not express any opinion as to matters governed by any law other than the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the federal laws of the United States of America.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares to be issued and sold by the Company to the Underwriters under the Agreement have been duly authorized and, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
In addition, we have represented the Company in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus Supplements and the Pricing Disclosure Package but not the Registration Statement (as originally filed), the Initial Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein (although we have reviewed such Registration Statement, Initial Prospectus and documents).  In the course of this representation, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and representatives of, and counsel to, the Underwriters in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus Supplements and the Pricing Disclosure Package and have considered the matters required to be stated therein and in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, although we have not independently verified, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package or in any document incorporated therein by reference.  In the course of the foregoing, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:
(a)The Registration Statement, as of the latest Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading;
               
(b)The Prospectus, as of its date and as of the applicable Delivery Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
              
(c)The Pricing Disclosure Package (but including no other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus other than that referred to on of the Agreement), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
               
Schedule II
provided, however, that in each case we express no view or belief with respect to the financial statements, schedules or other financial and accounting data contained or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package.
            This letter is furnished by us as counsel for the Company to the Underwriters and to the Board of Trustees of the Company, and is solely for the benefit of the Underwriters as such Underwriters and of the Trustees as such Trustees.
                                                                             Very truly yours,
 
                                                                              DAY PITNEY LLP

Re:
Issuance of 18,975,000 Common Shares
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Assistant General Counsel of Northeast Utilities Service Company, a service company subsidiary of Northeast Utilities (the "Company"), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the offer and sale by the Company of 18,975,000 common shares, $5.00 par value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated March 16, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters").
For purposes of the opinion I express below, I have examined the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-141425, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on March 20, 2007 (the "Registration Statement"); the base prospectus dated March 20, 2007; the preliminary prospectus (consisting of the base prospectus as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated March 16, 2009) filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) on March 16, 2009; and the final prospectus (consisting of the base prospectus as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated March 16, 2009) filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) on March 17, 2009.  I have reviewed the resolutions of the Board of Trustees adopted on February 10, 2009, and the resolutions of the Pricing Committee of the Board of Trustees adopted on March 16, 2009, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares.  I have examined such other agreements, instruments and documents, including the Underwriting Agreement, the Company's Declaration of Trust, and originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials, and certificates of officers and representatives of the Company as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not

independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement.
Based on the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations which I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that:
1.
The Company is a voluntary association validly existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and has the power, corporate or otherwise, to conduct its business as now conducted and to issue the Shares.
2.
The Shares are legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
This opinion is limited to the current laws of the State of New York, the current federal laws of the United States, and to the limited extent set forth below, the current laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and to the facts as they exist on the date hereof. I am not admitted to practice law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but I am generally familiar with the laws of such Commonwealth and have made such inquiries as I considered necessary to render my opinion. I express no opinion as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States. I undertake no obligation to advise you as a result of developments occurring after the date hereof including changes in such laws or interpretations thereof, or as a result of facts or circumstances brought to our attention after the date hereof.
I hereby consent to filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2009, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
Very truly yours,
