Item 8.01.
Other Events.
On April 17, 2009, Public Service Company of New Hampshire ("PSNH" or the "Company") filed with the Public Utilities Commission of the State of New Hampshire (the "Commission") a Petition for Temporary Rates requesting a temporary increase of $36.4 million in annual distribution service revenues, to be effective on July 1, 2009.
Following technical sessions conducted among the Office of Consumer Advocate, PSNH and Commission Staff, PSNH revised the proposed effective date of its request for temporary rates to August 1, 2009.  PSNH subsequently filed with the Commission requests for changes in its Energy Service ("ES") rate (which rate covers its generation assets), Stranded Cost Recovery Charge ("SCRC") rate and Transmission Cost Adjustment Mechanism ("TCAM") rate to be effective on the same date. An anticipated reduction in the ES rate is projected to offset in full the increase requested for temporary distribution rates as well as any changes in the SCRC and TCAM rates.
On June 30, 2009, PSNH filed with the Commission a request for a permanent increase in annual distribution service revenues of approximately $51 million to be effective on August 1, 2009.
On July 6, 2009, PSNH and the Commission Staff entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Regarding Temporary Rates (the "Settlement Agreement"), which, if accepted by the Commission, will resolve all issues regarding PSNH's request for temporary rates.  In the Settlement Agreement, PSNH and the Commission Staff agreed on a temporary increase of $25.6 million in annual distribution service revenues.  While the Settlement Agreement will result in an increase to distribution service rates effective August 1, 2009, when taken together with PSNH's requested simultaneous changes to its ES rate, SCRC rate and TCAM rate, the result would be a net decrease of approximately 1% in rates billed to customers who take energy service from PSNH.
Any temporary rate level approved by the Commission is subject to reconciliation upon Commission approval of a permanent distribution rate change.
The Commission will hold a hearing to consider the Settlement Agreement on July 13, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
