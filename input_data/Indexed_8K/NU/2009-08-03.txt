Item 8.01.
Other Events.
On July 31, 2009, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission ("NHPUC") issued an order accepting a settlement agreement dated July 6, 2009, entered into by Public Service Company of New Hampshire ("PSNH"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, and the NHPUC staff, which resolved all issues regarding PSNH's application for a temporary rate increase filed on April 17, 2009.
In the settlement agreement, PSNH and the NHPUC staff agreed on a temporary increase of $25.6 million in PSNH's distribution rates on an annualized basis, effective August 1, 2009. Included in the $25.6 million temporary increase is $6 million related to the recovery of storm costs incurred in December 2008. Because the $6 million will be applied to a deferred balance accrued in anticipation of recovery, it will not affect earnings but will improve cash flow.
On June 30, 2009, PSNH had filed an application with the NHPUC requesting a permanent increase in distribution rates of approximately $51 million on an annualized basis to be effective on August 1, 2009, and another $17 million effective July 1, 2010.  PSNH expects a decision on the permanent distribution rate request in mid-2010. Any differences between temporary and permanent rates will be reconciled back to August 1, 2009.
Reference is made to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters" in Northeast Utilities' and PSNH's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2009, and their Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 8, 2009 for further information about this matter.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date:  August 3, 2009
