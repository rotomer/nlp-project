Item 7.01   
Regulation FD Disclosure
On December 9, 2009, The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities ("NU"), filed a Letter of Intent with the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control indicating that it intends to file an application on or about January 8, 2010, to increase its distribution rates, to be phased in over a 2-year period beginning July 1, 2010.  The increase will be offset by a reduction of CL&P's Competitive Transition Assessment charge, which is charged to customers separately from the distribution rate, resulting from the repayment of its rate reduction bonds at the end of 2010.  Thus, customers will see no overall impact on their bills as a result of this 2-year rate proposal.  
A copy of CL&P's Letter of Intent is available at the following link:
