Item 8.01  Other Events
On September 28, 2010, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board ("EFSB") issued a Final Decision approving Western Massachusetts Electric Company's ("WMECO") petition to construct the 23-mile Massachusetts portion of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project ("GSRP") along WMECO's preferred route and pursuant to the project design virtually as proposed by WMECO in its petition.  The Decision is subject to a twenty-day appeals period. GSRP, which involves the construction of 115 kV and 345 kV lines from Ludlow, Massachusetts to Bloomfield, Connecticut, is the largest and most complicated project within Northeast Utilities' New England East-West Solution ("NEEWS") project and will be built by WMECO and its affiliate, The Co nnecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P"), both of which are subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities ("NU"). On March 16, 2010, the Connecticut Siting Council had approved the 12-mile section of GSRP that CL&P plans to build in Connecticut. NU currently estimates the cost of GSRP to be $714 million but the total cost is currently being evaluated in light of the Decision.  WMECO now expects to begin initial construction in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the majority of the construction, including overhead construction, to begin in 2011.  WMECO and CL&P expect to place the project in service in 2013.  
For further information, see NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010, under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Business Developm ent and Capital Expenditures."
