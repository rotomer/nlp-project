Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations
 
On October 16, 2010, Northeast Utilities ("Northeast Utilities"), NSTAR ("NSTAR"), NU Holding Energy 1 LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, and NU Holding Energy 2 LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). The following description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the respective boards of trustees of Northeast Utilities and NSTAR, at closing NSTAR will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities (the "Merger"). The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Northeast Utilities shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss due to the Merger.
Upon the completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding NSTAR common share of beneficial interest shall automatically be converted into 1.312 Northeast Utilities common shares of beneficial interest (the "Exchange Ratio").
The Merger Agreement also provides that upon the closing of the Merger, the board of trustees of Northeast Utilities will be made up of fourteen members consisting of (a) seven designees of Northeast Utilities (which will include Charles W. Shivery, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Utilities) and (b) seven designees of NSTAR (which will include Thomas J. May, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NSTAR). The Merger Agreement also provides that Northeast Utilities will have dual headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon completion of the Merger, Mr. May will become the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and Mr. Shivery will continue as non-executive Chairman of the combined company for eighteen months following the completion of the Merger, at which time Mr. May will become Chairman of Northeast Utilities.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, following the closing of the Merger, Northeast Utilities' dividend per common share of beneficial interest would be increased to a rate that is equivalent to NSTAR's last dividend per common share of beneficial interest dividend paid by NSTAR prior to the closing, multiplied at that time by the Exchange Ratio.
Completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, (a) requisite approvals of NSTAR and Northeast Utilities shareholders, which includes the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of beneficial interest of each company, (b) effectiveness of the registration statement for the Northeast Utilities common shares of beneficial interest to be issued to NSTAR shareholders in the Merger, (c) approval of the listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the Northeast Utilities common shares of beneficial interest to be issued in the Merger, (d) expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period and (e) receipt of all required regulatory approvals from, among others, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to additional customary conditions, including (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations and (iii) receipt by such party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of the Code.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Northeast Utilities and NSTAR, including, among others, covenants (a) to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and completion of the Merger, (b) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during this interim period, (c) that Northeast Utilities will convene and hold a special meeting of Northeast Utilities shareholders to consider and vote upon the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, the increase in the number of Northeast Utilities common shares of beneficial interest authorized for issuance, and the approval of the issuance of Northeast Utilities common shares of beneficial interest to be issued to
 
NSTAR shareholders in the Merger, (d) that NSTAR will convene and hold a special meeting of the NSTAR shareholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (e) that the parties use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain all governmental and regulatory approvals, subject to certain limitations. Each of Northeast Utilities and NSTAR is also subject to restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals, provide information and engage in discussion with third parties, except under limited circumstances to permit each of the respective boards of trustees of NSTAR and Northeast Utilities to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Northeast Utilities and NSTAR and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Northeast Utilities or NSTAR may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $135 million and reimburse the other party for expenses of up to $35 million.
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide shareholders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Northeast Utilities, NSTAR or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties. These representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Merger Agreement and (a) are not intended to be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate, (b) may have been qualified in the Merger Agreement by confidential disclosure schedules that were delivered to the other party in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement, which disclosure schedules may contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, (c) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from what might be viewed as material to shareholders and (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, shareholders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Northeast Utilities or NSTAR.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
 Northeast Utilities (NYSE-NU) and NSTAR (NYSE-NST) today announced that both companies' Boards of Trustees have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement that will create one of the nation's largest utilities, with a total enterprise value of $17.5 billion. The Company will continue to be called Northeast Utilities.
HARTFORD, CT and BOSTON, MA (October 18, 2010)
"The combination of Northeast Utilities and NSTAR will create a great New England based company, assuring the regional benefits of a locally controlled energy company for years to come," said Charles W. Shivery, Chairman, President and CEO of Northeast Utilities. "Our companies already have a strong track record of working together for New England. We recently jointly executed an agreement to invest $1.1 billion in new transmission lines to Qubec, which will provide low-carbon hydro energy to power one million homes in New England beginning in 2015."
"NSTAR's strong cash flows are very complementary to Northeast Utilities' attractive regulated investment opportunities, mitigating the need for future equity issuances which is a significant benefit for our shareholders," continued Mr. Shivery. "This merger, upon completion, will provide a significant increase in the dividend for Northeast Utilities shareholders and will enable long term dividend growth opportunities that are so important to all of our investors."
Thomas J. May, Chairman, President and CEO of NSTAR said, "This is simply the start. Together, with enhanced financial resources, complementary distribution and transmission assets, reputations for operating excellence and talented employees, we will be able to accomplish great things. NSTAR's very strong balance sheet coupled with Northeast Utilities' impressive array of transmission investment opportunities and diversified suite of distribution businesses translates into a compelling
growth story. Merging with Northeast Utilities provides more diverse, stable and higher earnings and dividend growth than NSTAR would have achieved on its own. It also assures that the long track record of success our investors have enjoyed in the past will continue."
Mr. May added, "With this transaction we will create a larger, stronger and more diversified regulated utility with over 9,000 employees in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut, thereby benefiting our region as a whole. The combined company will have the scale, employee talent and financial resources to meet the complex and demanding energy needs of customers across New England and provide sustainable energy solutions that will support regional growth."
The companies will come together in a stock for stock merger of equals. The combined company will provide electric and gas energy to over half of the customers in New England.
The combined company will operate six regulated electric and gas utilities in three states and will have nearly 3.5 million electric and gas customers. Northeast Utilities will have nearly 4,500 miles of electric transmission lines, 72,000 miles of electric distribution lines and 6,000 miles of gas distribution lines.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to Northeast Utilities' earnings in the first year following close.
CUSTOMER BENEFITS
The transaction will create many opportunities for the companies to leverage their combined resources to strengthen service quality in the various service territories. The two companies have plans to invest $9 billion in New England's energy infrastructure over the next five years. The combined scope and scale of Northeast Utilities will make investment more cost effective, spread over a larger customer base, allowing investments on a scale that might not be attractive to the companies on a stand-alone basis. In addition, the combined company will share best practices and implement them over the entire customer base. For example, Northeast Utilities and NSTAR have been long recognized by many national and international organizations for the success of their energy-efficiency programs that, when combined, total more than $200 million in annual spending.
Customers will not experience any merger-related rate changes. The merger is expected to produce important long term net savings as a result of efficiencies. These efficiencies are expected to be realized over time primarily through process improvements, voluntary attrition and retirements. Current terms of the collective bargaining agreements will remain in place.
Both companies have longstanding reputations as excellent corporate citizens and Northeast Utilities will maintain the current level of funding for vital civic and philanthropic organizations across its combined service areas.
 
TERMS
Under the terms of the agreement, NSTAR shareholders would receive 1.312 Northeast Utilities common shares for each NSTAR share that they own in a transaction with a total equity value of $9.5 billion and an enterprise value of $17.5 billion. The exchange ratio reflects a no premium merger based on the average closing share price of each company for the preceding 20 trading days. Following completion of the merger, it is anticipated that Northeast Utilities shareholders would own approximately 56 percent and NSTAR shareholders would own approximately44 percent of the combined company. The agreement provides that, upon closing of the transaction, Northeast Utilities' dividend per share would be increased to a rate that is equivalent to NSTAR's dividend per share, at that time, on an exchange ratio adjusted basis.
ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP
Northeast Utilities will have dual headquarters in Hartford, CT and Boston, MA.
Upon the closing of the transaction, Charles W. Shivery will become the Non-Executive Chairman of Northeast Utilities for a period of 18 months. Thomas J. May will serve as President and CEO of Northeast Utilities and assume the additional role of Chairman after 18 months.
The Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities will be made up of a combination of Trustees from the two companies, including 7 members nominated by the Board of Northeast Utilities and 7 members nominated by the Board of NSTAR, with the Lead Trustee nominated by the Board of Northeast Utilities.
APPROVALS AND TIMING
The merger is conditioned upon, among other things, approval by two-thirds of the outstanding shares of both companies, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and reviews by federal and state energy authorities. These include the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
The companies anticipate that the regulatory approvals can be obtained within 9  12 months. The companies intend to seek shareholder approval of the transaction in early 2011.
