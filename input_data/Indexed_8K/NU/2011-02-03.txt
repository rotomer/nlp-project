Other Events.
On January 31, 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities ("DPU") issued a decision ("Decision") on the request by Western Massachusetts Electric Company ("WMECO" or the "Company") for an increase in electric distribution rates.  WMECO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities.
In the Decision, the DPU approved:
 - 
an increase in annual distribution revenues of $16.8 million, effective February 1, 2011, subject to the DPU's approval of a compliance filing;
 - 
an allowed return on equity ("ROE") of 9.6 percent;
 - 
a decoupling mechanism with no inflation adjustment;
 - 
an inclining block rate structure pursuant to which residential non-heating customers using more than 600 kilowatt hours per month will be billed at a higher rate;
 - 
recovery of certain active hardship account balances; and
 - 
recovery of certain storm costs over five years, subject to further proceedings.  
In its filing with the DPU on July 16, 2010, WMECO requested a $28.4 million increase in annual distribution revenues and an allowed ROE of 10.5 percent.  The DPU did not approve WMECO's request for rate recovery of increased reliability infrastructure investment averaging approximately $20 million per year.
A copy of the Decision can be found on the "Rate Case Updates" link on the "Investors" page of Northeast Utilities' website at www.nu.com.
