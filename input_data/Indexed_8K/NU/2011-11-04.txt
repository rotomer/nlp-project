Northeast Utilities (NYSE: NU) today reported earnings of $90 million, or $0.51 per share, in the third quarter of 2011, down from $100.5 million, or $0.57 per share, earned in the third quarter of 2010.  Third quarter results for 2011 reflect after-tax expenses of $0.6 million associated with NU's pending merger with NSTAR.  Excluding those expenses, NU earned $90.6 million, or $0.51 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
HARTFORD, Connecticut, November 4, 2011

NU attributed the lower operating results in the third quarter of 2011 to several factors, including a 2.1 percent decline in retail electric sales compared with the third quarter of 2010, which resulted from milder weather in the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of Tropical Storm Irene.  Lower results also reflect higher pension and other employee benefit costs in the third quarter of 2011, as well as a higher effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2011, compared with the third quarter of 2010.  
Transmission
NU's transmission segment earned $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with
$45.2 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Lower third quarter 2011 earnings primarily reflect a higher effective tax rate and certain higher employee benefit costs, partially offset by a higher transmission rate base.  
Distribution and Generation
NU's distribution and generation segment earned $55 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $55.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The Connecticut Light and Power Company's (CL&P) distribution segment earned $34.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $31.5 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Public Service Company of New Hampshire's (PSNH) distribution and generation segment earned $20.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $23.4 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Western Massachusetts Electric Company's (WMECO) distribution and generation segment earned $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Lower third quarter 2011 results were due to a $3.2 million non-recurring charge to establish a billing adjustment reserve, as well as higher depreciation expense.  
Yankee Gas Services Company lost $3 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with a loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2010.  On a weather-adjusted basis, Yankee Gas' firm natural gas sales in 2011 were up 5.2 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same period of 2010.  The sales increases were due in large part to more conversions by commercial and industrial customers from interruptible to firm service and increased use of distributed generation fueled by natural gas.
 
 
 
NU parent and other companies 
 
NU parent and other companies had net after-tax expenses of $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with after-tax expenses of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Third quarter 2011 results include $0.6 million of after-tax expenses related to NU's pending merger with NSTAR.  Excluding merger expenses, NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2011.  No merger expenses were recorded in the third quarter of 2010.  
 
2011 earnings guidance
NU today reiterated its 2011 stand-alone full-year consolidated earnings guidance of between $2.30 per share and $2.40 per share, excluding projected after-tax expenses of approximately $0.20 per share related to the NSTAR merger.  Including the merger expenses, NU projects earnings of between $2.10 per share and $2.20 per share.  Those estimates reflect distribution and generation segment earnings guidance of between $1.30 per share and $1.35 per share, transmission segment earnings guidance of between $1.05 per share and $1.10 per share, and NU parent and other companies net expenses of $0.05 per share, excluding merger expenses.

Retail sales data:
NU has approximately 177 million common shares outstanding.  It operates New England's largest energy delivery system, serving more than 2 million customers in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
All per share amounts in this news release are reported on a fully diluted basis.  The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU parent.  The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct interest in NU's assets and liabilities as a whole.  EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interests of each business by the weighted average fully diluted NU parent common shares outstanding for the period.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results and to provide details of earnings results and guidance by business.  In addition, earnings per share excluding merger expenses is a non-GAAP measure.  Management believes that these measures are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of NU's businesses.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to NU consolidated net income attributable to controlling interests or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of NU's operating performance.
