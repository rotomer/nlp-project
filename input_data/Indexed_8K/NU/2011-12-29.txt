Item 8.01
Other Events.
On December 20, 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") issued two orders approving the indirect transfer of control of the operating licenses for Yankee Nuclear Power Station and Haddam Neck Plant held by Yankee Atomic Electric Company and Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, respectively (together, the "Yankee Companies"), which will be effected upon the merger of Northeast Utilities ("NU") and NSTAR. The orders are subject to a post-merger condition that requires NU's subsidiaries, which will control the Yankee Companies, to cause them to implement negation action plans consistent with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 50.38, designed to address the potential for "foreign ownership, control or domination" of the Yankee Companies.  No further approvals for the merger are required from the NRC.
NU and NSTAR are still awaiting approval of their pending merger from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
For further information regarding the pending NU-NSTAR merger, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-170754) filed by NU with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the merger, NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2011, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
