On January 4, 2012, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority ("PURA") issued a draft decision in Docket No. 10-12-05RE01 (the "Draft Decision") in which PURA revised its earlier declaratory ruling of June 1, 2011, that concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review the pending merger between Northeast Utilities ("NU") and NSTAR. The Draft Decision ruled that NU and NSTAR must now seek approval from PURA pursuant to Connecticut law prior to completing the merger. Written exceptions and/or briefs concerning the Draft Decision must be submitted to PURA by January 9, 2012, and oral arguments have been scheduled for January 12, 2012. PURA expects to render its final decision on whether PURA has jurisdiction over the merger on January 18, 2012.
The Draft Decision stated that, "[PURA] is mindful of certain milestones relating to the completion of the proposed merger and will dedicate all necessary staff resources to achieve a complete and thorough regulatory review consistent with that time schedule."
NU and NSTAR are awaiting approval of the merger from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
For further information regarding the pending NU-NSTAR merger, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-170754) filed by NU with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the merger, NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2011, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2011 and December 29, 2011.
