Other Events.
On January 18, 2012, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority ("PURA") issued a final decision in Docket No. 10-12-05RE01, confirming its January 4, 2012 draft decision, in which it revised its earlier declaratory ruling of June 1, 2011 that concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review the pending merger between Northeast Utilities ("NU") and NSTAR.  The final decision ruled that NU and NSTAR must now seek approval from PURA prior to completing the merger pursuant to Connecticut state law.  As a result, on January 19, 2012, NU and NSTAR filed with PURA an application for approval of the merger.
 
NU and NSTAR are awaiting approval of the merger from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
For further information regarding the pending NU-NSTAR merger, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-170754) filed by NU with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the merger; NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010; its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on December 5, 2011, December 29, 2011 and January 5, 2012.
