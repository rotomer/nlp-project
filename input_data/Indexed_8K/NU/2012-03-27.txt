The application was originally filed by NU and NSTAR on January 19, 2012. The Connecticut Light and Power Company ("CL&P") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities.
In the Draft Decision, PURA approved the merger by stock exchange of NU and NSTAR subject to orders requiring NU to submit to PURA letters, notices and worksheets detailed in the Draft Decision.
