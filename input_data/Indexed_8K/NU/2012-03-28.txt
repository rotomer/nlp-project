(xi) the Registration Statement has become effective; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, no order directed to the adequacy of any document incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and no proceedings for either such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering are pending before or threatened by the Commission;
(xii) such counsel (A) is of the opinion that each document, if any, filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements, schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or any amendment to the Prospectus, as to which such counsel need not express any opinion) complied when so filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and (B) is of the opinion that the Registration Statement, on the Effective Date, and each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, at the time it was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations (except for financial statements, schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as to which such counsel need not express any opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations. Such counsel shall also state that he has no reason to believe that (except for financial statements, schedules and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Pricing Disclosure Package, and except for that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Form T-1, as to all of which such counsel need not express any belief):

Insofar as Mr. Miller's opinion relates to matters governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, he may rely on the opinion of even date therewith of Kerry J. Tomasevich, Senior Counsel of Northeast Utilities Service Company, as addressed to him. The foregoing opinion shall be addressed to or shall allow the Underwriters to rely on such opinion as if they were an addressee thereto.
The opinion of Counsel described in this Section 6(d) shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
The Underwriters shall have received from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, special counsel for the Underwriters, an opinion dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, with respect to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(e)
 
The Underwriters shall have received on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, letters, the first dated the date hereof and the second dated the Closing Date, each in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, from Deloitte & Touche LLP, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(f)
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters herein contained, the Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:

If, at any time prior to the filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Pricing Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the
(b)

(e)
To endeavor to qualify the Notes for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives shall reasonably request; , , that the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a consent to service of process or to file annual reports or to comply with any other requirements deemed by the Company in its reasonable judgment to be unduly burdensome.

To retain in accordance with the Rules and Regulations all Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses it uses or refers to; and if at any time after the date hereof any events shall have occurred as a result of which any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary to amend or supplement any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, to notify the Representatives and, upon their request, to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended or supplemented Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that will correct such conflict, statement or omission or effect such compliance.
(h)
To make generally available to the Company's security holders, as soon as practicable, an earning statement (which need not be audited) covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the "effective date of the registration statement" within the meaning of Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations, which earning statement shall be in such form, and be made generally available to security holders in such a manner, as to meet the requirements of the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations.

(l)
The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.
(m)
The Company will pay the applicable Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Rules and Regulations without regard to the proviso thereof.
(n)
If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the
(o)
Renewal Deadline
 
Notes remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Notes. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
If at any time when Notes remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Notes, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Notes to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
(p)
a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities when and as incurred by them (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) that are based upon or arise out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package (as defined to include, as of the Applicable Time, the most recent Preliminary Prospectus, together with each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule II hereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
8. Indemnity and Contribution.
 
thereto, or any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations) contained in any free writing prospectus, so long as the Company consented in writing to such free writing prospectus prior to its first use or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(g) hereof.
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendments or supplements thereto, which information is limited to the information set forth in Section 8(g) hereof.
(b)
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing (but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party under this subsection shall not relieve it from any liability which it otherwise might have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this subsection) and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party has not retained counsel within a reasonable period of time after the request by the indemnified party to do so. It is understood that the
(c)
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) hereof is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) hereof but also the relative fault of each indemnifying party on the one hand and each indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of each indemnifying party on the one hand and each indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
(d)
 
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d) hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(e)
pro rata
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
(f)
The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the statements regarding (i) delivery of the Notes by the Underwriters set forth in the last paragraph of text on the cover page, (ii) in the third and fifth paragraphs of text under the caption "Underwriting" appearing on page S-17 and (iii) in the third sentence of the fourth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" appearing on page S-17 of the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information
(g)
 
concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or there shall have been established by any of such exchanges or by the Commission or by any federal or state agency or by the decision of any court, any general limitation on prices for such trading or any general restrictions on the distribution of securities, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) there shall have occurred any (A) outbreak of hostilities affecting the United States or (B) other national or international calamity or crisis, or any material adverse change in financial, political or economic conditions affecting the United States, including, but not limited to, an escalation of hostilities that existed prior to the date of this Agreement, or (v) there shall have occurred any material disruption in commercial banking securities settlement or clearance services and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 9(a)(i) through 9(a)(v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it impracticable or inadvisable, in the judgment of the Representatives, to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9. Termination.
a) If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter or Underwriters in Schedule I hereto that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate amount of such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Notes of such Underwriter or Underwriters to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of such Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate amount of such Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date;
10. Defaulting Underwriters.
 
that in no event shall the amount of the Notes that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of such Notes without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of such Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because any condition to the obligation of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
(b)
. The Company acknowledges and agrees that in connection with this offering, sale of the Notes or any other services the Underwriters may be deemed to be providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by the Underwriters: (i) no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company and any other person, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, exists; (ii) the Underwriters are not acting as advisors, expert or otherwise, to the Company, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of the public offering price of the Notes, and such relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, is entirely and solely commercial and based on arms-length negotiations; any duties and obligations that the Underwriters may have to the Company shall be limited to those duties and obligations specifically stated herein; and (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company hereby waives any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with this offering.
11. No Fiduciary Duty
(iii) 
 
. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. The provisions of Sections 8 and 10(b) hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT 4
EXHIBIT A
THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITARY. THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY) MAY BE REGISTERED EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to Northeast Utilities or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
No. 1
NORTHEAST UTILITIES, a voluntary association duly organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "Company," which term includes any successor entity under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000.00) on September 20, 2013 (the "Final Maturity"), and to pay interest thereon from the date of original issuance of the Notes or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears, on March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), and on Final Maturity, commencing June 20, 2012, at a rate equal to LIBOR (as defined below) plus 0.75%, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and, subject to the terms of the Indenture, at the same rate on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any overdue installment of interest.
If any of the Interest Payment Dates (other than the Final Maturity) falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day unless that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Final Maturity falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Final Maturity.
Interest on this Security will accrue from, and including, March 22, 2012, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the Final Maturity, as the case may be. Interest on this Security will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in each quarterly interest period. The accrued interest for any period will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. The accrued interest factor will be computed by summing the daily interest factor applied to each day from the start of the quarterly interest period to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The daily interest factor (expressed as a decimal rounded upwards if necessary) will be computed by dividing the interest rate then in effect (expressed as a decimal rounded upwards if necessary) by 360.
The Company will pay the interest payable for any Interest Payment Date to the person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business (1) on the Business Day prior to each Interest Payment Date if this Security remains in book-entry only form or (2) on the fifteenth calendar day before each Interest Payment Date if this Security does not remain in book-entry only form. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
A "Business Day" shall mean any day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York or in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close; provided, that the day is also a London Business Day. "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
The calculation agent appointed by the Company with respect to this Security, initially The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (in such capacity, the "Calculation Agent"), will calculate the interest rate on this Security and, promptly upon such calculation, will notify the Company and the Trustee, if the Trustee is not then serving as the Calculation Agent, of such interest rate. The Calculation Agent will reset the interest rate on each Interest Payment Date, each of which is referred to as an "Interest Reset Date." The second London Business Day preceding an Interest Reset Date will be the "Interest Determination Date" for that Interest Reset
 
Date. The interest rate in effect on each day that is not an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date. The interest rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to that Interest Reset Date, except that the interest rate in effect for the period from and including March 22, 2012 to the first Interest Reset Date will be the initial interest rate. The interest rate on this Security will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of any Holder, provide the interest rate then in effect. All calculations made by the Calculation Agent in the absence of manifest error shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holders. The Company may appoint a successor calculation agent.
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the interest rate with respect to this Security will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards (for example, 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655) and 9.876544% (or .09876544) being rounded to 9.87654% (or .0987654)), and all dollar amounts in or resulting from any such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).
"LIBOR" means the rate determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) With respect to any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the first day of the applicable interest period that appears on Bloomberg US0003M Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears, then LIBOR, in respect of that Interest Determination Date, will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (2) below.
(2) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Bloomberg US0003M Page, as specified in (1) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the first day of the applicable interest period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the City of New York, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by this sentence, LIBOR will be the same as the rate determined for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date.
 
"Bloomberg US0003M Page" means the display designated on page "US0003M" on Bloomberg (or such other page as may replace the US0003M page on that service or any successor service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits of major banks).
Payment of the principal of and any interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.
This Security has initially been issued in the form of a Global Security, and the Company has initially designated The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (the "Depositary," which term shall include any successor depositary) as the Depositary for this Security. For as long as this Security or any portion hereof is issued in such form, and notwithstanding the previous paragraph, all payments of interest, principal and other amounts in respect of this Security or portion thereof shall be made to the Depositary or its nominee in accordance with its applicable policies and procedures, in the coin or currency specified above and as further provided on the reverse hereof.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2002, as amended and supplemented from time to time and as amended and supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 15, 2012 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor trustee to The Bank of New York), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under Indenture), as to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000.00. The provisions of this Security, together with the provisions of the Indenture, shall govern the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Holder, the Company and the Trustee with respect to this Security, provided that, if any provision of this Security conflicts with any provision of the Indenture, the provision of this Security shall be controlling to the fullest extent permitted under the Indenture.
The Securities of this series will not be subject to any sinking fund and will not be subject to redemption prior to Final Maturity.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and the premium, if any) and interest, if any, on this Security at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Security shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary with respect to such series or its nominee only as provided in this paragraph. This Security shall be so exchangeable if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part. Securities so issued in exchange for this Security shall be of the same series, having the same interest rate, if any, and maturity and having the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations and in the aggregate having the same principal amount as this Security and registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of a Security of the series of which this Security is a part is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of (and any premium) and interest, if any, on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of the series of which this Security is a part are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
For so long as this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility with respect to the policies and procedures of the Depositary or for any notices or other communications among the Depositary, its direct and indirect participants or the beneficial owners of this Security.
 
Neither the failure to give any notice nor any defect in any notice given to the Holder of this Security or any other Security of this series will affect the sufficiency of any notice given to any other Holder of any Securities of this series.
The Indenture provides that the Company, at its option (a) will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities (except for certain obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Securities, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Securities, maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust) or (b) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture, in each case if the Company deposits, in trust, with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations which, through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms, will provide money, in an amount sufficient to pay all the principal of and premium, if any and interest, if any, on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of such Securities, and certain other conditions are satisfied.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any trustee, incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Declaration of Trust of the Company provides that no shareholder of the Company shall be held to any liability whatsoever for the payment of any sum of money, or for damages or otherwise under any contract, obligation or undertaking made, entered into or issued by the trustees of the Company or by any officer, agent or representative elected or appointed by the trustees and no such contract, obligation or undertaking shall be enforceable against the trustees or any of them in their or his individual capacities or capacity and all such contracts, obligations and undertakings shall be enforceable only against the trustees as such, and every person, firm, association, trust and corporation having any claim or demand arising out of any such contract, obligation or undertaking shall look only to the trust estate for the payment or satisfaction thereof.
This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
All terms used in this Security not defined herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

EXHIBIT 5
 
Northeast Utilities
56 Prospect Street
Hartford, Connecticut 06103-2818
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Assistant General Counsel of Northeast Utilities Service Company ("NUSCO"), a service company affiliate of Northeast Utilities (the "Company"), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale to the public of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes, Series D, Due 2013 (the "Notes"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated March 19, 2012 among Northeast Utilities and Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein ("Underwriting Agreement"). The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of April 1, 2002, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by four indentures supplemental thereto (the "Indenture"), including a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 15, 2012, establishing the terms of the Notes. The Company has registered its Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (Commission File No. 333-16579, the "Registration Statement"). The Notes were issued on March 22, 2012.
For purposes of the opinion I express below, I have examined, among other agreements, instruments and documents, the Registration Statement, including the prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated March 19, 2012 (the "Prospectus"), and its exhibits, including the Indenture, and the organizational documents of the Company and originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and other documents as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement.
Based on the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations which I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that the Notes are legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are valid and binding obligations of the Company.
The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following further assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions:
A. I express no opinion regarding the effectiveness of any waiver in respect of the Notes of any rights of any party, or duties owing to it, as a matter of law, or that is broadly stated or does not describe the right or duty purportedly waived with reasonable specificity.
B. My opinions set forth above are subject to the effect of (a) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws and court decisions of general application (including without limitation statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent or preferential transfers) relating to, limiting or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (b) principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in equity) that may limit the enforceability of any of the remedies, covenants or other provisions of the Notes or the Indenture, or the availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies or as such principles relate to, limit or affect the enforcement of creditor's rights generally.
C. In addition, I express no opinion as to any provisions of the Notes or the Indenture regarding the remedies available to any person (1) to take action that is arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious or is not taken in good faith or in a commercially reasonable manner, whether or not such action is permitted under the Notes or the Indenture, or (2) for violation or breaches that are determined by a court to be non-material or without substantially adverse effect upon the ability of the Company to perform its material obligations under the Notes or the Indenture.
D. This opinion is limited to the current laws of the State of New York, the current federal laws of the United States, and to the limited extent set forth below, the current laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and to the facts as they exist on the date hereof. I am not admitted to practice law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but I am generally familiar with the laws of such Commonwealth and have made such inquiries as I considered necessary to render my opinion. I express no opinion as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States. I undertake no obligation to advise you as a result of developments occurring after the date hereof including changes in such laws or interpretations thereof, or as a result of facts or circumstances brought to my attention after the date hereof.
This opinion is furnished only to you in connection with the transaction contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Underwriting Agreement and is solely for your benefit. Other than as stated below, this opinion is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person for any purpose without my prior written consent (including by any person that acquires Notes from you).
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, and to the reference to me under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, I do not admit that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commission.
