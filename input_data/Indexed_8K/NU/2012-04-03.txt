On April 2, 2012, the Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority ("PURA") issued a final decision (the "Final Decision") in Docket No. 12-01-07, the proceeding to consider the joint application for approval of the merger transaction involving Northeast Utilities ("NU") and NSTAR. The Final Decision confirmed PURA's draft decision issued on March 26, 2012, described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Registrants with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 27, 2012.
A copy of the Final Decision is available at the following link:

NU and NSTAR are awaiting approval from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities ("DPU"). On February 15, 2012, NU and NSTAR reached comprehensive merger-related settlement agreements with both the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources agreeing to certain conditions with respect to the merger, which are subject to DPU approval and have been requested by the parties to be approved on April 4, 2012. If the DPU issues an acceptable decision on April 4, 2012, NU expects the merger will be consummated by April 16, 2012.
For further information regarding the pending NU-NSTAR merger, please refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-170754) filed by NU with the SEC in connection with the merger; NU's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and NU's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 5, 2012, January 19, 2012, February 15, 2012, February 21, 2012, March 13, 2012 and March 27, 2012.
