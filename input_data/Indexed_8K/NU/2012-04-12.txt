Item 4.01 Certifying Accountant (Dismissal and Appointment)
On April 9, 2012, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Company's board of directors authorized the dismissal of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as its independent registered public accounting firm.  The dismissal became effective upon the consummation of the Merger on April 10, 2012.
PwC's audit reports on the Company's' consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.  
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,  and through April 9, 2012, there have been  (1) no disagreements with PwC on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years, and (2) there were no reportable events, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of        Regulation S-K.
The Company has provided PwC with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and has requested that PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements regarding PwC.  A copy of such letter, dated April 10, 2012, is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
 On April 9, 2012, also in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the board of directors of the Company authorized the engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective with the consummation of the Merger on April 10, 2012.  During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and through the date of this Form 8-K, the Company did not consult Deloitte with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Deloitte did not provide any written report or oral advice to the Company that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
