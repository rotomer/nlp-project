Item 5.08
Shareholder Director Nominations.
The Northeast Utilities 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders has been scheduled for May 1, 2013, which date is more than thirty days prior to the anniversary date of the Company's 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  
In accordance with Rule 14a-5(f) under the Exchange Act and other applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Company has determined that proposals to be considered for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2013 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including shareholder Trustee nominations and any notice on Schedule 14N, must be received by the Company at the address set forth below no later than November 21, 2012, and must satisfy the conditions established by the SEC. Written notice of proposals of shareholders to be considered at the 2013 Annual Meeting without inclusion in next year's proxy statement must be received on or before February 5, 2013. If a notice is received after February 5, 2013, then the notice will be considered untimely and the proxies held by management may provide the discretion to vote against such proposal, even though the proposal is not discussed in the proxy statement. Northeast Utilities considers these dates to be reasonable deadlines for submission of proposals before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials for the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Shareholder proposals should be addressed to: Richard J. Morrison, Assistant Secretary, Northeast Utilities, Post Office Box 270, Hartford, Connecticut 06141-0270.
