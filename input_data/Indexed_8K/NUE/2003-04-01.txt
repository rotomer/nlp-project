On March 24, 2003, Nucor Steel Kingman, LLC ("Nucor Kingman"), a subsidiary of Nucor Corporation "(Nucor"), acquired substantially all of the operating assets of the Kingman, Arizona steel facility of North Star Steel Company ("North Star") for $35 million in cash. Pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement dated as of March 17, 2003, Nucor Kingman acquired substantially all of the property, plant and equipment used in the manufacturing process at the facility. Nucor Kingman also assumed certain operating contracts, which Nucor believes will not have a material effect on the operations of the facility.
