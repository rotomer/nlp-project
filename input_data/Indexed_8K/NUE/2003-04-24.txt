CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, April 24, 2003  Nucor Corporation's consolidated net sales for the first quarter ended April 5, 2003 increased 37% to $1,480,300,000, compared with $1,080,600,000 in the first quarter of 2002. Average sales price per ton increased 3% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 33% from the first quarter of 2002.
 
Nucor's consolidated net earnings for the current year's first quarter were $17,800,000 ($0.23 per share), compared with $20,300,000 ($0.26 per share) in the first quarter of 2002. Net earnings were negatively impacted by increased scrap and energy costs. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased from $96 in the first quarter of 2002 to $122 in the first quarter of 2003. Total energy costs increased approximately $4 per ton from the first quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2003. In the first quarter of 2003, Nucor reported other income of $2,300,000 related to a graphite electrodes anti-trust settlement received during the quarter ($1,500,000 after tax and profit-sharing, or $0.02 per share). Nucor had an effective tax rate of 21.5% in the first quarter of 2003, compared with 34.6% in the first quarter of 2002 and 29.5% for the year 2002. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to state income tax credits, resolution of certain tax issues and the effect of reduced pre-tax earnings.
 
The first quarter established new records in the steel mills segment for steel production, total steel shipments and steel sales to outside customers. Steel production was 4,258,000 tons in the first quarter, compared with 3,237,000 tons produced in the first quarter of 2002. Total steel shipments were 4,346,000 tons, compared with 3,272,000 tons in last year's first quarter. Steel sales to outside customers were 4,040,000 tons, compared with 3,023,000 tons in last year's first quarter. In the steel products segment, steel joist production during the first quarter was 107,000 tons, compared with 94,000 tons in the first quarter of 2002. Steel deck sales were 80,000 tons, compared with 61,000 tons in last year's first quarter. Cold finished steel sales were 69,000 tons, compared with 51,000 tons in the first quarter of 2002.
 
Pre-operating, start-up and acquisition expenses of new facilities increased to $27,800,000 in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $23,500,000 in the first quarter of the prior year. For the first quarter of 2003, these costs primarily related to the start-up of the sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama (formerly Trico Steel Company, LLC) and the new Castrip
facility at our sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana. In the first quarter of 2002, these costs primarily related to the start-up of the plate mill in Hertford County, North Carolina and the Vulcraft facility in Chemung, New York.
 
Starting with the May 12, 2003 dividend payment, Nucor's regular quarterly cash dividend rate is being increased from $0.19 to $0.20 per share. Nucor has increased its dividend every year since Nucor began paying dividends 30 years ago.
 
Nucor expects that weak economic conditions and depressed levels of non-residential construction will continue to impact the second quarter of 2003, and that earnings in the second quarter will be similar to the earnings in the first quarter of 2003.
 
Nucor is the largest steel producer in the United States and is the nation's largest recycler. Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in fourteen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing.
