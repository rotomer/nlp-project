Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, January 27, 2005  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today record earnings and sales for 2004. Net earnings per share and average shares outstanding for all periods reflect a two-for-one stock split effective in October 2004.
 
Nucor's consolidated net earnings for 2004 were $1.12 billion ($7.02 per diluted share), compared with $62.8 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in 2003. Consolidated net earnings for this year's fourth quarter were $341.4 million ($2.12 per diluted share), compared with $20.6 million ($0.13 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increased earnings are primarily attributable to higher average selling prices and increased margins, accompanied by the successful integration of the coiled plate mill in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and the cold rolling mill in Decatur, Alabama.
 
Nucor's consolidated net sales for 2004 increased 82% to $11.38 billion, compared with $6.27 billion in 2003. Average sales price per ton increased 66% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 9% from 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 86% to $3.09 billion, compared with $1.66 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003. From the fourth quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2004, average sales price per ton increased 85% and total tons shipped to outside customers increased 1%.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 74% from $137 in 2003 to $238 in 2004, and increased 79% from $155 in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $278 in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $375.9 million in 2004 (including a LIFO charge of $36.7 million for Nucor-Yamato Steel Company, of which Nucor owns 51%), compared with a charge of $115.0 million in 2003 (including a LIFO charge of $17.6 million for Nucor-Yamato Steel Company). In the fourth quarter of 2004, the LIFO charge was $152.5 million (including a LIFO charge of $11.3 million for Nucor-Yamato Steel Company), compared with a charge of $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 (including a LIFO charge of $8.9 million for Nucor-Yamato Steel Company).
 
During 2004, Nucor revised estimates for environmental reserves as additional information was obtained, reducing environmental reserves by $10.0 million, compared with a reduction of $8.3 million in 2003. In both the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, Nucor reduced estimates for environmental reserves by $.2 million.
 
Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities decreased to $28.8 million in 2004, compared with $117.5 million in 2003. For the fourth quarter of 2004, pre-operating and start-up costs were $7.5 million compared with $26.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2004, these costs primarily related to the continuing start-up of the Castrip facility at our sheet mill in Crawfordsville, Indiana. In 2003, these costs primarily related to the start-up of the sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama (formerly Trico Steel Company, LLC) and the Castrip facility.
 
 
 
 
We are pleased to announce that the Castrip process is commercially viable, and that we have assembled a team to determine the second Nucor location for a Castrip operation in the United States. We also plan to establish at least one joint venture with a partner overseas in 2005 to utilize the Castrip technology.
 
In 2004, Nucor established company records in its steel mills segment for steel production, total steel shipments and steel sales to outside customers. Steel production was 19,737,000 tons, compared with 17,441,000 tons produced in 2003, an increase of 13%. Total steel shipments increased 10% to 19,464,000 tons in 2004, compared with 17,656,000 tons in 2003. Steel shipments to outside customers increased 9% to 17,787,000 tons in 2004, compared with 16,263,000 tons in 2003. In the steel products segment, steel joist production during 2004 increased to 522,000 tons, compared with 503,000 tons in 2003. Steel deck sales increased to 364,000 tons in 2004, compared with 353,000 tons in 2003. Cold finished steel sales increased to 271,000 tons, compared with 237,000 tons in 2003.
 
Nucor had an effective tax rate of 35.2% in 2004 compared with 6.1% in 2003, and had an effective tax rate of 34.7% in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with (29.9%) in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of increased pre-tax earnings in 2004, partially offset by resolution of certain tax issues in the second half of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, Nucor recorded refundable state income tax credits of $4.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
 
Earlier this month, Nucor announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of Fort Howard Steel, Inc.'s operations in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. This facility produces cold finished bar product and has approximately 140,000 tons of annual capacity. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in mid February after satisfactory resolution of regulatory approvals, transfer of appropriate permits and other contracts, and other closing conditions.
 
Nucor expects to earn between $1.70 and $1.90 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $0.72 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year due to seasonal softness in the construction market because of weather conditions. We expect that the strong business conditions experienced in 2004 will continue through 2005 and that the second and third quarters of 2005 will be stronger than the first quarter.
 
Nucor is the largest steel producer in the United States and is the nation's largest recycler. Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in fourteen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing.
