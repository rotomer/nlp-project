In June 2005, Nucor's wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Marion, Inc., purchased substantially all of the assets of Marion Steel Company for a cash purchase price of approximately $108.7 million. The facility is a bar products mill that manufactures angles, flats, rebar, rounds and signposts. Located in Marion, Ohio, the mill is in close proximity to 60% of the steel consumption in the United States. The facility has annual capacity of approximately 400,000 tons.
 
During the second quarter of 2005, Nucor repurchased 4.0 million shares of Nucor's common stock at a cost of approximately $205.8 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program. Approximately 4.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the current program.
 
Nucor expects third quarter earnings to be below both the third quarter of 2004 and the second quarter of 2005 due principally to the conditions in the sheet market. We believe that earnings will be in the range of $1.60 to $1.80 per diluted share. While the sheet market will be largely responsible for this decrease, we are currently seeing improvements in the market for sheet products and believe that this improvement trend will continue.
 
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in sixteen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing. Nucor is the nation's largest recycler.
