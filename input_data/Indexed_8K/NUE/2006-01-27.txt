CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, January 27, 2006  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today record consolidated net earnings and sales for 2005. Nucor's consolidated net earnings for 2005 were $1.31 billion ($8.26 per diluted share), an increase of 17% over net earnings of $1.12 billion ($7.02 per diluted share) in 2004. Consolidated net earnings of $341.0 million ($2.18 per diluted share) in this year's fourth quarter were flat compared with $341.4 million ($2.12 per diluted share) earned in the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased 17% from the $291.9 million ($1.86 per diluted share) earned in the third quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter earnings per share improved 3% over the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily due to a smaller number of shares outstanding during the quarter.
 
Nucor's consolidated net sales for 2005 increased 12% to $12.70 billion, compared with $11.38 billion in 2004. Average sales price per ton increased 4% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 7% from 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 4% to $3.21 billion, compared with $3.09 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased 6% compared with $3.03 billion from the third quarter of 2005. Average sales price per ton decreased 10% from the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased 10% from the third quarter of 2005. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 5,089,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 15% over the fourth quarter of 2004 and a decrease of 4% from the third quarter of 2005.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 3% from $238 in 2004 to $244 in 2005, decreased 14% from $278 in the fourth quarter of 2004 to $240 in the fourth quarter of 2005, and increased 11% from $217 in the third quarter of 2005. Total energy costs increased approximately $7 per ton from 2004 to 2005, increased approximately $10 per ton from the fourth quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2005, and increased approximately $3 per ton from the third quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2005. Nucor is partially hedged against exposure to increases in energy costs.
 
Nucor incurred a credit to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $151.6 million in 2005, compared with a charge of $375.9 million in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the LIFO credit was $3.6 million, compared with a charge of $152.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, and a credit of $52.0 million in the third quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter LIFO credit was well below our forecast of $50.0 million.
 
In 2005, Nucor established company records in its steel mills segment for steel production, total steel shipments and steel sales to outside customers. Steel production was 20,332,000 tons, compared with 19,737,000 tons produced in 2004, an increase of 3%. Total steel shipments increased 6% to 20,669,000 tons in 2005, compared with 19,464,000 tons in 2004. Based on the strength of our bar, plate and beam products, steel shipments to outside customers increased 7% to 19,020,000 tons in 2005, compared with 17,787,000 tons in 2004. In the steel products segment, steel joist production during 2005 increased to 554,000 tons, compared with 522,000 tons in 2004. Steel deck sales increased to a record 380,000 tons in 2005, compared with 364,000 tons in 2004. Cold finished steel sales increased to a record 342,000 tons, compared with 271,000 tons in 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
In 2005, Nucor increased its base dividend and paid a quarterly supplemental dividend, resulting in dividend payments tripling from $69.7 million in 2004 to $209.8 million in 2005. We recently announced an additional increase in the supplemental dividend to $0.50 per share for a total dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in the first quarter of 2006, compared with the total dividend of $0.40 per share paid in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Nucor repurchased approximately 845,000 shares of Nucor's common stock at a cost of approximately $46.1 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2005, and repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares at a cost of about $291.2 million during 2005. Approximately 12.9 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.
 
Nucor expects that the first quarter of 2006 will be another strong quarter, as we continue to benefit from product line diversification. We expect that overall demand and margins for our products will remain strong and that earnings will be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10 per diluted share.
 
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in sixteen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing. Nucor is the nation's largest recycler.
