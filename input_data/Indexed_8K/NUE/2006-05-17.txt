Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 12, 2001, Nucor Corporation (the "Company") issued one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") with respect to each outstanding share of common stock, $0.40 par value per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The rights were issued to the holders of record of Common Shares on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one five-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $4.00 par value (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $150.00 per one five-thousandth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment in certain specified circumstances. Following the stock spilt effected by the Company on October 18, 2004, the Purchase Price was automatically adjusted to $75.00. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement"), dated as of March 8, 2001, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
On May 11, 2006, the board of directors of the Company approved a 2-for-1 stock split that will be effected by issuing one additional Common Share for each Common Share held by stockholders of record on May 19, 2006. The additional Common Shares will be distributed on or about May 31, 2006. Absent further action by the board of directors, the Purchase Price would be automatically reduced to $37.50 as a result of the stock split. Accordingly, in order to offset the effect of the stock splits and to reflect the increase in the market value of the Common Shares since adoption of the Rights Agreement, the board of directors also authorized the officers of the Company and directed the Rights Agent to amend the Rights Plan before the stock split to fix the Purchase Price under the Rights Plan at $300. Following the record date for the 2-for-1 stock split of May 19, 2006, the Purchase Price will be automatically reduced to $150.
