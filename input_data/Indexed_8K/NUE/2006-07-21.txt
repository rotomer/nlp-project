Nucor repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of Nucor's common stock at a cost of approximately $186.4 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2006, and repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at a cost of about $196.7 million during the first half of 2006. Approximately 22.0 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the current program. Since the first quarter of 2005, Nucor has purchased approximately 15.0 million shares of Nucor's common stock.
In May 2006, Nucor's wholly owned subsidiary, Nucor Steel Connecticut, Inc., purchased substantially all of the assets of Connecticut Steel Corporation for a cash purchase price of approximately $43.9 million. Located in Wallingford, Connecticut, this bar products mill has an annual capacity of approximately 300,000 tons of wire rod and rebar and approximately 85,000 tons of wire mesh fabrication and structural mesh fabrication.
Also in May 2006, Nucor announced plans to construct its fourth facility to produce metal building systems and components. The facility will be located in the western United States and will have an annual capacity of approximately 45,000 tons. It is expected to cost approximately $27 million and to employ more than 200 people.
In June 2006, Nucor announced plans to construct its fourth sheet steel galvanizing facility which will be located at Nucor's sheet mill in Decatur, Alabama. Annual capacity will be approximately 500,000 tons, and the facility will have the ability to produce 72-inch wide sheet. Total cost is estimated to be approximately $150 million.
In July 2006, Nucor announced plans to construct a steel mill in the southern United States that will produce special bar quality products. The facility will have a capacity of approximately 850,000 tons and will produce high quality carbon and alloy rounds and round cornered squares from 3" to 9" for the automotive, heavy equipment and service center markets. Several locations are currently under consideration.
For all three recently announced projects, construction is expected to begin after satisfactory resolution of site location, regulatory approvals, tax matters and various contracts.
Current orders and backlogs are healthy across all product lines. The strong business conditions experienced in the second quarter should continue through the third quarter and well into the fourth quarter. We expect that earnings for the third quarter will continue to be very strong.
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in seventeen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing. Nucor is the nation's largest recycler.
