Nucor repurchased approximately 6.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $318.3 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program during the third quarter of 2006, and repurchased approximately 10.1 million shares at a cost of about $515.0 million during the first nine months of 2006. Approximately 15.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the current program. Since the first quarter of 2005, Nucor has repurchased approximately 21.3 million shares of common stock.
In September 2006, Nucor announced an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Verco Manufacturing Company ("Verco") for a cash purchase price of approximately $180 million. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2006 and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. This facility produces steel floor and roof decking in three locations in the western United States. With the addition of the Verco facilities, Nucor's total annual deck capacity will exceed 500,000 tons.
Earnings for the fourth quarter will be strong, but they will be impacted by lower shipments due to normal seasonal issues and to the current inventory destocking by our service center customers. These high inventories are due in part to the unexpected continued high levels of imports in the third quarter. We expect margins to be strong in the fourth quarter. Margins will be negatively impacted by lower spot market prices for sheet and bars, but they will benefit from anticipated lower scrap costs. We will provide numerical guidance near the midpoint of the interval between quarterly earnings reports.
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in seventeen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing. Nucor is the nation's largest recycler.
