CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, January 25, 2007  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today record consolidated net earnings and sales for 2006. Nucor's consolidated net earnings for 2006 were $1.76 billion ($5.68 per diluted share), an increase of 34% over net earnings of $1.31 billion ($4.13 per diluted share) in 2005.

Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $5.4 million in 2006, compared with a credit of $151.6 million in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the LIFO credit was $39.6 million, compared with a credit of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and a charge of $20.5 million in the third quarter of 2006.
In 2006, Nucor established company records in its steel mills segment for steel production, total steel shipments and steel sales to outside customers. Steel production was 22,382,000 tons, compared with 20,332,000 tons produced in 2005, an increase of 10%. Total steel shipments increased 8% to 22,346,000 tons in 2006, compared with 20,669,000 tons in 2005. Steel shipments to outside customers increased 9% to 20,649,000 tons in 2006, compared with 19,020,000 tons in 2005. In the steel products segment, steel joist production during 2006 increased to 570,000 tons, compared with 554,000 tons in 2005. Steel deck sales increased to a record 398,000 tons in 2006, compared with 380,000 tons in 2005. Cold finished steel sales decreased to 327,000 tons, compared with 342,000 tons in 2005.
In December 2006, Nucor's Board of Directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share in addition to the $0.10 per share base dividend. The total dividend of $0.60 per share is payable on February 9, 2007 to shareholders of record on December 29, 2006. Nucor's dividends paid to shareholders have increased more than nine-fold since 2003: $62 million paid in 2003, $70 million paid in 2004, $210 million paid in 2005, and $578 million paid in 2006.
 
 
Nucor repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $84.4 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2006, and repurchased approximately 11.7 million shares at a cost of about $599.4 million during 2006. Approximately 14.1 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the current program. Since the first quarter of 2005, Nucor has repurchased approximately 22.8 million shares of common stock.
On January 2, 2007, Nucor announced an agreement to make an all-cash tender offer for all of the shares of Harris Steel Group, Inc. ("Harris Steel") at C$46.25 per share. On January 22, 2007, Harris Steel mailed offering documents to its shareholders. The offer, which has the full support of the Boards of Directors of both Nucor and Harris Steel, will remain open for acceptance until March 2, 2007, unless extended or withdrawn. Shareholders owning or exercising control over 13.7 million shares, or approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding shares, have entered into a lock-up agreement to irrevocably tender their shares to this offer. Completion of the acquisition will occur upon satisfactory resolution of regulatory approvals in the United States and Canada. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Nucor.
Harris Steel is engaged in the fabrication and placing of concrete reinforcing steel; the design and installation of concrete post-tensioning systems; the manufacture and distribution of wire and wire products, welded wire mesh and cold finished bar; and the manufacture and distribution of heavy industrial steel grating, aluminum grating and expanded metal. These operations serve customers throughout Canada and the United States. Harris Steel also participates in steel trading on a worldwide basis, and in the distribution of reinforcing steel and related products to U.S. customers. Harris Steel has approximately 27 million shares listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol HSG.
We continue to expect good demand for our products in 2007, as evidenced by recently announced price increases for many of our products. In addition, excess inventory levels at service centers and OEM's should continue to decline. We expect inventories to be at more normal levels by the end of the first quarter, but this will depend on a continued decrease in imports from the record levels of 2006. As a result of the expected continuation of healthy demand and margins, we anticipate continued solid earnings in the first quarter. The risks that we see are again import levels and the movement of scrap prices in the quarter. Continued increases in scrap costs will, at the very least, result in a LIFO charge for the quarter versus the credit we recorded in the fourth quarter. We will provide numerical guidance near the midpoint of the interval between earnings reports.
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities in nineteen states. Products produced are: carbon and alloy steel  in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; and light gauge steel framing. Nucor is the nation's largest recycler.
