Exhibit 99.1
 
CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, July 19, 2007  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today consolidated net earnings for the first half of 2007 of $725.9 million ($2.39 per diluted share), a decrease of 13% from net earnings of $830.0 million ($2.65 per diluted share) in last year's first half.
Consolidated net earnings of $344.9 million ($1.14 per diluted share) in this year's second quarter were a decrease of 23% from $450.0 million ($1.44 per diluted share) earned in the second quarter of 2006 and a decrease of 9% from the $381.0 million ($1.26 per diluted share) earned in the first quarter of 2007.
While second quarter earnings per share of $1.14 represent historically strong results, these earnings have been adversely impacted by several factors. Continued softness in the sheet market due to persistently high imports of steel and steel bearing manufactured products, particularly from China, and the reduced demand resulting from the slowdown in the automotive, appliance and housing sectors, have contributed to a decrease in the rate of inventory reductions by our sheet customers. In addition, increased scrap and energy costs, and the resulting increase in the LIFO charge, reduced our margins in the second quarter.
In the first half of 2007, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 8% to $7.94 billion, compared with $7.35 billion in last year's first half. Average sales price per ton increased 9% while total tons shipped to outside customers decreased 1% from the first half of 2006.
In the second quarter of 2007, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 10% to $4.17 billion, compared with $3.81 billion in the second quarter of 2006 and increased 11% compared with $3.77 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Average sales price per ton increased 13% from the second quarter of 2006 and increased 11% from the first quarter of 2007. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 5,621,000 tons in the second quarter of 2007, a decrease of 3% from the record shipments in the second quarter of 2006 and a decrease of 1% from the first quarter of 2007.
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first half of 2007 was $275, an increase of 14% compared with $242 in the first half of 2006. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the second quarter of 2007 was $291, an increase of 18% compared with $247 in the second quarter of 2006 and an increase of 12% compared with $259 in the first quarter of 2007.
Total energy costs for the first half of 2007 remained flat compared with the first half of 2006, increased $3 per ton from the second quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of 2007, and increased $2 per ton from the first quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2007.
Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $91.0 million in the first half of 2007, compared with a charge of $24.5 million in the first half of 2006. In the second quarter of 2007, the LIFO charge was $66.5 million, compared with a charge of $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2006 and a charge of $24.5 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Steel production decreased 4% to 11,103,000 tons in the first half of 2007, compared with 11,519,000 tons produced in the first half of 2006.
Total steel shipments decreased 5% to 11,067,000 tons in the first half of 2007, compared with 11,616,000 tons in last year's first half. Steel shipments to outside customers decreased 6% to 10,119,000 tons in the first half of 2007, compared with 10,713,000 tons in last year's first half.
 
 
 
In the steel products segment, steel joist production during the first half of 2007 decreased to 265,000 tons, compared with 281,000 tons in the first half of 2006. Steel deck sales increased to 232,000 tons in the first half of 2007, compared with 179,000 tons in last year's first half. Cold finished steel sales increased to 206,000 tons, compared with 187,000 tons in the first half of 2006. With the acquisition of Harris Steel Group Inc. at the end of the first quarter, sales of fabricated concrete reinforcing steel were 204,000 tons in the first half of 2007.
In June, Nucor's board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share in addition to the $0.11 per share base dividend. The total dividend of $0.61 per share is payable on August 10, 2007 to stockholders of record on June 29, 2007. Nucor began paying a supplemental dividend in the second quarter of 2005, allowing stockholders to participate in our successful pay-for-performance business model.
During the second quarter, Nucor repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Nucor's common stock at a cost of approximately $154.2 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program. Approximately 11.6 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.
In June, Nucor announced that it entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which Nucor will acquire Magnatrax Corporation ("Magnatrax"), via the merger of Magnatrax with a wholly owned subsidiary of Nucor, for a cash purchase price of approximately $280 million. Magnatrax is a leading provider of custom-engineered metal building systems for the growing North American non-residential construction market. Magnatrax also offers architectural metal roofing systems for new and retrofit construction, and provides related transportation services. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2007 after satisfactory resolution of certain closing conditions and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings.
Our outlook for the third quarter is in-line with the results of the first six months of 2007. We will provide numerical guidance near the midpoint of the interval between quarterly earnings reports.
In the second half of 2007, Nucor expects bar shipments to improve over the second quarter pace. We expect that the sheet market will continue to be challenging due to imports from China and the ongoing difficult conditions in the automotive and housing sectors. We project that our beam mills and plate mills will continue to experience strong demand. In addition, the outlook for the second half of 2007 is positive for Nucor's downstream, value-added businesses.

(On January 1, 2007, Nucor adopted FASB Staff Position AUG AIR-1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities," which eliminates the method that Nucor had previously used of accruing in advance for planned major maintenance activities. In accordance with this position statement, Nucor now uses the deferral method of accounting for such maintenance activities. The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the effects of applying this new accounting principle.)
