In September, Nucors board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share in addition to the $0.11 per share base dividend. The total dividend of $0.61 per share is payable on November 9, 2007 to stockholders of record on September 28, 2007. Nucor began paying a supplemental dividend in the second quarter of 2005, allowing stockholders to participate in our successful pay-for-performance business model.
 
During the third quarter, Nucor repurchased approximately 11.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $599.8 million, completing the previous repurchase authorization. During the first nine months, Nucor repurchased approximately 14.1 million shares at a cost of about $754.0 million. In September, the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional 30 million shares of common stock, all of which remain available for repurchase.
 
In the third quarter, Nucor completed the acquisition of three downstream companies: Magnatrax Corporation, LMP Steel & Wire and Consolidated Rebar, Inc. (acquired through Nucors wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel Inc.). These acquisitions enhance Nucors product diversification and are part of the execution of Nucors strategy for profitable downstream growth.
 
In addition, Nucor announced two acquisitions in September that are expected to close in the fourth quarter. Nucor has entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of Nelson Steel, Inc., a producer of wire mesh and related products, with capacity of approximately 80,000 tons. Nucors wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel Inc., has entered into an agreement with Barker Steel Company, Inc. to form a new entity that combines the two companies rebar fabrication operations in the northeastern U.S. market. Harris will contribute two facilities located in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, as well as cash, for a 90% equity interest in the new venture. In exchange for a 10% interest in the venture, Barker will contribute its eight northeastern U.S. facilities located in New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts (3) and Rhode Island. The Barker facilities have total rebar fabrication capacity of approximately 218,000 tons. With the completion of the Barker joint venture, Harris Steels annual rebar fabrication capacity will exceed 1 million tons.
 
We expect that the fourth quarter of 2007 will be another good quarter with earnings in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 per diluted share. We expect continued strength in bar, beam, plate and many of our downstream businesses. Market conditions for sheet are slowly improving with more balance between customer inventories and demand. We are also finally seeing a significant drop in imports, which has helped bring these inventories back into balance. Fourth quarter shipments will be impacted by the usual seasonal and holiday factors, including scheduled shut-downs at many of our facilities for regular maintenance. The biggest risks to our forecast for the fourth quarter and 2008 remain any further weakening in the economy and any significant reversal of the recent decreases in import levels.
 
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; light gauge steel framing; steel grating and expanded metal; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.

Unaudited figures are as follows:
 
 
(On January 1, 2007, Nucor adopted
FASB Staff Position AUG AIR-1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, which eliminates the method that Nucor had previously used of accruing in advance for planned major maintenance activities. In accordance with this position statement, Nucor now uses the deferral method of accounting for such maintenance activities. The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the effects of applying this new accounting principle.)
