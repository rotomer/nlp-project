CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, January 24, 2008 - Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today consolidated net earnings of
$364.8 million ($1.26 per
diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of 10% compared with
$405.1 million ($1.34 per
diluted share) earned in the fourth quarter of 2006 and a decrease of 4% from the $381.2 million ($1.29 per diluted share) earned in the third quarter of 2007.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, Nucors consolidated net sales increased 27% to a quarterly record $4.40 billion, compared with $3.47 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased 3% compared with $4.26 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Average sales price per ton increased 9% from the fourth quarter of 2006 and increased 1% from the third quarter of 2007. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 5,895,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 16% over the fourth quarter of 2006 and an increase of 2% over the third quarter of 2007.
 
For the full year 2007, consolidated net earnings were $1.47 billion ($4.94 per diluted share), compared with the record net earnings of $1.76 billion ($5.68 per diluted share) in 2006. Although net earnings decreased 16% from 2006 levels, 2007 was the second-best earnings year in Nucors history.
 
Nucors consolidated net sales for 2007 increased 12% to a record $16.59 billion, compared with $14.75 billion in 2006. Average sales price per ton increased 8% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 4% from 2006.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 17% from $243 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $285 in the fourth quarter of 2007, increased 3% from $277 in the third quarter of 2007, and increased 13% from $246 in 2006 to $278 in 2007.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $92.3 million, compared with a credit of $39.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, and a charge of $11.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. For the full year 2007, the LIFO charge was $194.3 million, compared with a charge of $5.4 million in 2006.
 
In the steel mill segment, steel production decreased 1% to 22,089,000 tons in 2007, compared with 22,382,000 tons produced in 2006.
 
Total steel shipments remained flat at
22,347,000
tons in 2007, compared with 22
,346,000
tons in 2006. Steel shipments to outside customers decreased 2% to 20,235,000 tons in 2007, compared with 20,649,000 tons in 2006.
 
In the steel products segment, steel joist production during 2007 decreased to 542,000 tons, compared with 570,000 tons in 2006. Steel deck sales increased to 478,000 tons in 2007, compared with 398,000 tons in 2006. Cold finished steel sales increased to 449,000 tons, compared with 327,000 tons in 2006. Sales of fabricated concrete reinforcing steel were 583,000 tons from the acquisition date of Harris Steel Group Inc. near the end of the first quarter of 2007 through the end of the year (approximately 9 months).

In December 2007, Nucors board of directors increased the base dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.30 per share and declared a supplemental dividend of $0.31 per share. The total dividend of $0.61 per share is payable on February 11, 2008 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2007. The board of directors stated that the 173% increase in the quarterly base dividend reflects the companys success in building long-term earnings power and the companys belief that the business cycle for steel will see both higher highs and higher lows in the future.
 
During 2007, Nucor repurchased approximately 14.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $754.0 million under a publicly announced stock repurchase program (none in the fourth quarter of 2007). Approximately 30.0 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the current program.
 
In the fourth quarter, Nucor completed the acquisition of Nelson Steel, Inc., a producer of wire mesh and related products. In addition, Nucors wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel Inc. completed three acquisitions in the fourth quarter. Harris Steel formed a new entity with Barker Steel Company, Inc. that combines the two companies rebar fabrication operations in the northeastern U.S. market. Harris Steel has a 90% interest in the joint venture. During the quarter, Harris Steel also acquired Rockford Fabricators Inc., a rebar fabricator, and U.S. Drafting and Detailing Inc., a provider of rebar detailing and project management services. With these acquisitions, Harris Steels annual rebar fabrication capacity exceeds 1 million tons.
 
In January 2008, Nucor signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Duferco Group (Lugano, Switzerland) to establish a 50/50 joint venture for the production of beams in Italy and the distribution of beams in Europe and North Africa. The joint venture will encompass the Duferco Groups wholly owned subsidiary, Duferdofin, and associated distribution companies. Duferdofin is the leader in beam production in Italy and Southern Europe. Final agreement to establish the joint venture company will be dependent upon the completion of due diligence, approval of regulatory bodies, and approval of the boards of directors of both companies.
 
We expect that the first quarter of 2008 will be another good quarter with earnings in the range of $1.20 to $1.30 per diluted share.  We expect continued strength in our bar, beam and plate businesses. Our downstream businesses, in particular rebar fabrication, should remain good. Market conditions for sheet have improved, in spite of reduced demand, because of a much better balance between customer inventories and demand. We believe the market conditions for the first six months of 2008 are likely to be the opposite of what we saw in the late 1990s. During that period, we had very strong demand for our products but also a glut of supply resulting from huge imports of finished steel. This severe imbalance made it very difficult for the domestic steel producers to achieve the profitability that would be expected for such a cyclical peak in demand.  
 
First quarter shipments should be strong in spite of the normal weather related issues. Scrap price volatility and actual scrap usage costs in the quarter will be a risk impacting first quarter profitability.  Other risks to our forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2008 are any increased weakening in the economy and any significant reversal of the lower import levels that we have been experiencing for several months now.
