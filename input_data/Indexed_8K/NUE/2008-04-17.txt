CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, April 17, 2008 - Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today record first quarter net earnings for the fifth consecutive year. Consolidated net earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were
$409.8 million
, an increase of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2007 net earnings of
$381.0 million
and an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2007 net earnings of $364.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $1.41 from $1.26 in the first quarter of 2007 and in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in earnings per share from the first quarter of 2007 is partially due to the reduced number of shares outstanding as a result of stock repurchases made in 2007.
 
Nucors consolidated net sales increased 32% to a record $4.97 billion compared with $3.77 billion in the first quarter of 2007 due to a 15%
increase in average steel sales price per ton, an 11% increase in average steel products sales price per ton, and a significant increase in steel products shipments attributable to acquisitions made in 2007. The increase in sales is also due to the February 29, 2008 acquisition of the stock of SHV North America Corporation, which owns 100% of The David J. Joseph Company (DJJ) and its affiliates, for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. DJJ, which now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nucor Corporation, has been the broker of ferrous scrap to Nucor since 1969.
Consolidated net sales increased 13% over the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily due to an 8% increase in average steel sales price per ton and the acquisition of DJJ.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 29% from $259 in the first quarter of 2007 to $333 in the first quarter of 2008 and increased 17% from $285 in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Total energy costs increased approximately $4 per ton from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 and increased approximately $3 per ton from the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $69.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared with a charge of $24.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 and a charge of $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
In the steel mills segment, steel production increased 4% to 5,831,000 tons in the first quarter of 2008, compared with 5,585,000 tons produced in the first quarter of 2007, and increased 4% over the 5,586,000 tons produced in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Total steel shipments increased 5% to
5,951,000
tons in the first quarter of 2008, compared with
5,660,000
tons in last years first quarter, and increased 5% over the 5,684,000 total tons shipped in the fourth quarter. Steel shipments to outside customers of 5,203,000 tons in the first quarter of 2008 remained flat compared with 5,229,000 tons in the first quarter of 2007, and increased 2% over the 5,078,000 tons shipped in the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the steel products segment, steel joist production during the first quarter was 132,000 tons, compared with 121,000 tons in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 9%. Steel deck sales increased 9% from 106,000 tons in the first quarter of 2007 to 116,000 tons in this years first quarter. Cold finished steel sales increased 51% to 136,000 tons, compared with 90,000 tons in the first quarter of 2007. Sales of fabricated concrete reinforcing steel increased from 40,000 tons in the month of March 2007 (when Nucor acquired Harris Steel Group Inc.) to 179,000 tons in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Subsequent to the first quarter Nucor completed two acquisitions, utilizing DJJ as a platform for continued growth in the scrap processing industry. In April 2008, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nucor acquired substantially all the assets of Metal Recycling Services Inc. (MRS). Based in Monroe, North Carolina, MRS operates a full-service processing facility and two feeder yards and expects to process 220,000 tons annually. MRS will become part of DJJ and will operate under the Metal Recycling Services, LLC name.
Also in April 2008, DJJ acquired substantially all the assets of Galamba Metals Group. Galamba operated 16 full-service scrap processing facilities in Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas and processed over 500,000 tons annually. DJJ will operate the Galamba Metals Group facilities under the Advantage Metals Recycling, LLC name.
Nucor expects to soon conclude a 50/50 joint venture with the Duferco Group (Lugano, Switzerland) for the production of beams in Italy and the distribution of beams in Europe and North Africa. The joint venture will encompass the Duferco Groups Duferdofin subsidiary and associated distribution companies.
Starting with the May 9, 2008 dividend payment, Nucor is increasing the base quarterly cash dividend rate from $0.30 to $0.32 per share. In addition to the $0.32 per share base dividend amount, the board of directors approved the payment of a supplemental dividend of $0.20 per share, for a total dividend of $0.52 per share. Nucor has increased its regular base cash dividend every year since Nucor began paying dividends 35 years ago.
We expect second quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.60 per diluted share. We expect continued strength in our sheet, plate, beam and bar businesses due to the solid global demand for steel. In our overall downstream businesses we expect conditions to continue to be good, particularly for rebar fabrication, cold finish bars, steel grating, and wire rod and mesh products. We believe our upstream raw material businesses will be accretive in the second quarter. DJJs net earnings for the one month that they were owned by Nucor were offset by the purchase accounting adjustments in the period.
