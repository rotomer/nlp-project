On May 12, 2008, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Nucor entered into an agreement with Duferco Italia Holding S.p.A to acquire 50% of the equity of Duferdofin S.p.A. for a price of 423.5 million (approximately US$652.6 million), subject to adjustment after the closing based upon the net working capital and long-term liabilities of Duferdofin at closing. Duferdofin operates four long product manufacturing facilities and two distribution companies in Italy. The obligations of buyer under the agreement are guaranteed by Nucor and the obligations of seller are guaranteed by Duferco Participations Holding Ltd., the ultimate parent of the Duferco group of companies.
Prior to closing, Duferdofin and its corporate subsidiaries will be converted into limited liability companies and the name of Duferdofin will be changed to Duferdofin-Nucor S.r.l. Closing is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2008 after satisfactory resolution of regulatory approvals, transfer of appropriate permits and contracts, and other closing conditions.
 
A copy of the press release issued by Nucor on May 13, 2008 concerning the transaction is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
