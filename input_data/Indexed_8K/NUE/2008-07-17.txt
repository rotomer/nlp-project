Nucor incurred a record charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of a $214.0 million ($0.42 per diluted share, after tax) in the second quarter of 2008, compared with a charge of $66.5 million ($0.13 per diluted share, after tax) in the second quarter of 2007 and a charge of $69.0 million ($0.14 per diluted share, after tax) in the first quarter of 2008. The LIFO charge in the first half of 2008 was a record $283.0 million ($0.57 per diluted share, after tax), compared with a charge of $91.0 million ($0.18 per diluted share, after tax) in the first half of 2007. The LIFO expense in the second quarter of 2008 was greater than the total LIFO expense for all of 2007.
 
In the steel mills segment, steel production increased 7% to a record 11,874,000 tons in the first half of 2008, compared with 11,103,000 tons produced in the first half of 2007.
 
Total steel shipments increased 9% to a record
12,068,000
tons in the first half of 2008, compared with
11,067,000
tons in last years first half. Steel shipments to outside customers increased 5% to 10,597,000 tons in the first half of 2008, compared with 10,119,000 tons in last years first half.
 
In the steel products segment, steel joist production during the first half of 2008 increased to 272,000 tons, compared with 265,000 tons in the first half of 2007. Steel deck sales increased to a record 255,000 tons in the first half of 2008, compared with 232,000 tons in last year's first half. Cold finished steel sales increased to a record 279,000 tons, compared with 206,000 tons in the first half of 2007. Sales of fabricated concrete reinforcing steel were 411,000 tons in the first half of 2008 compared to 204,000 in the first half of 2007.
 
In late May 2008, Nucor completed a public offering of 27,667,580 common shares at an offering price of $74.00 per share. Gross proceeds of the offering were approximately $2.05 billion, which Nucor intends to use for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital needs and repayment of debt. Also in early June 2008, Nucor issued $1.00 billion in debt with interest rates ranging from 5% to 6.4% and with maturities from 2013 to 2037. Nucors long-term debt ratings of A+ by Standard and Poors and A1 by Moodys Investors Services are the highest ratings of any metals and mining company in North America.
 
In June, Nucors board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.20 per share in addition to the $0.32 per share base dividend. The total dividend of $0.52 per share is payable on August 11, 2008 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2008. Nucor began paying a supplemental dividend in the second quarter of 2005, allowing stockholders to participate in our successful pay-for-performance business model.
 
 
Also in June, Nucor announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel, Inc., signed a Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Ambassador Steel Corporation (Ambassador) for a cash purchase price of approximately $185 million. Based in Auburn, Indiana, Ambassador is a fabricator and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2008 after satisfactory resolution of certain closing conditions.
 
 
 
 
In July, Nucor completed the acquisition of 50% of the stock of Duferdofin - Nucor S.r.l., for the purchase price of 423.5 million (approximately $658 million). The company will operate from its current headquarters in San Zeno, Italy. Duferdofin - Nucor S.r.l. operates a steel melting and bloom/billet caster in San Zeno as well as rolling mills in Pallanzeno and Giammoro. Total production in 2007 was approximately one million tons. A new merchant bar mill, which is expected to produce approximately 450,000 tons, is under construction at the Giammarro plant and is expected to be fully operational in late 2008.
 
 
Two other projects were also announced in the second quarter. Nucor applied for a permit to build a $2 billion
state-of-the-art iron-making facility in St. James Parish, Louisiana.  Sites outside of the United States are still being considered, and the site selection and capital investment are subject to approval by Nucors board of directors.  The facility is expected to produce 3,000,000 tons of pig iron, employing the latest technologies to reduce emissions.
 
 
Nucor also announced
the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Sidenor S.A. (ATH: SID) to purchase a 34% share of a new joint venture that will be formed for the production and distribution of long steel products and plate in the Balkans, Turkey, Cyprus and North Africa.  Final agreement to establish the joint venture is dependent upon execution of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence and approval of regulatory bodies and the boards of directors of both companies.
 
 
We expect that third quarter results will be strong, with earnings in the range of $1.80 to $1.85 per diluted share. We expect continued strength in our sheet, plate, beam and bar businesses due to the solid global demand for steel. Although our downstream businesses will be challenged by rising steel prices, we expect continued good results from this segment. The forecasted range of $1.80 to $1.85 per diluted share for the third quarter reflects an increase in the diluted average shares outstanding over the second quarter of approximately 6% due to Nucors common stock offering on May 29, 2008. (The additional shares were outstanding only for a portion of the second quarter, resulting in an increase of more than 3% in diluted shares outstanding from the first quarter of 2008.)
 
Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., Nucor makes more steel in America than any other company. Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel - in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; light gauge steel framing; steel grating and expanded metal; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HBI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.
