CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, October 16, 2008 - Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today record consolidated net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 of $734.6 million ($2.31 per diluted share), an increase of 93% from the $381.2 million ($1.29 per diluted share) earned in the third quarter of 2007 and an increase of 26% compared with $580.8 million ($1.94 per diluted share) earned in the second quarter of 2008.
Consolidated net earnings for the first nine months of 2008 were a record $1.73 billion ($5.70 per diluted share), an increase of 56% from net earnings of $1.11 billion ($3.68 per diluted share) in last years first nine months.
 
In the third quarter of 2008, Nucors consolidated net sales increased 75% to a record $7.45 billion, compared with $4.26 billion in the third quarter of 2007 and increased 5% compared with $7.09 billion in the second quarter of 2008. Average sales price per ton increased 51% from the third quarter of 2007 and increased 21% from the second quarter of 2008. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 6,701,000 tons in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 16% over the third quarter of 2007 and a decrease of 13% compared to the second quarter of 2008.
 
In the first nine months of 2008, Nucors consolidated net sales increased 60% to a record $19.51 billion, compared with $12.20 billion in last years first nine months. Average sales price per ton increased 30% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 23% compared to the first nine months of 2007.
 
The increases in sales and net earnings are attributable in part to the significant acquisitions made by Nucor in the last 21 months, including Harris Steel Group, Inc. (Harris) in March 2007 and The David J. Joseph Company (DJJ) in February 2008. Nucor has also used these two companies as platforms for additional acquisitions to grow the rebar fabrication and scrap businesses.
 
Nucors performance is not tied to any one steel market due to our product line diversity. With the acquisition of Harris and other downstream products companies, Nucors steel products annual capacity has more than doubled since the beginning of 2007 to more than 4.5 million tons. In addition, these companies provide our steel mills with a profitable base load of volume.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 92% from $277 in the third quarter of 2007 to $533 in the third quarter of 2008, and increased 17% from $456 in the second quarter of 2008. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first nine months of 2008 increased 60% to $439 compared to $275 in the first nine months of 2007.
 
Nucor incurred a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $140.0 million ($0.25 per diluted share, after tax) in the third quarter of 2008, compared with a charge of $11.0 million ($0.02 per diluted share, after tax) in the third quarter of 2007 and a charge of $214.0 million ($0.42 per diluted share, after tax) in the second quarter of 2008. In the first nine months of 2008, the LIFO charge was a record $423.0 million ($0.82 per diluted share, after tax), compared with a charge of $102.0 million ($0.20 per diluted share, after tax) in the first nine months of 2007.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total energy costs in the third quarter of 2008 increased $7 per ton from the third quarter of 2007 and increased $3 per ton from the second quarter of 2008. During the first nine months of 2008, total energy costs increased $5 per ton compared with the first nine months of 2007.
 
In the steel mills segment, steel production increased 5% to 17,384,000 tons in the first nine months of 2008, compared with 16,503,000 tons produced in the first nine months of 2007.
 
Total steel shipments increased 5% to
17,506,000
tons in the first nine months of 2008, compared with 16
,663,000
tons in last years first nine months. Steel shipments to outside customers increased 1% to 15,285,000 tons in the first nine months of 2008, compared with 15,157,000 tons in last years first nine months.
 
In the steel products segment, steel joist production during the first nine months of 2008 decreased to 391,000 tons, compared with 409,000 tons in the first nine months of 2007. Steel deck sales increased to 388,000 tons in the first nine months of 2008, compared with 355,000 tons in last year's first nine months. Cold finished steel sales increased to 394,000 tons compared to 322,000 tons in the first nine months of 2007. Sales of fabricated concrete reinforcing steel were 669,000 tons compared to 385,000 in the first nine months of 2007.
 
In September, Nucors board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.20 per share in addition to the $0.32 per share base dividend. The total dividend of $0.52 per share is payable on November 11, 2008 to stockholders of record on September 30, 2008. The payment of a supplemental dividend in any future period will depend upon many factors, including Nucors earnings, cash flow and financial position.
 
In August, Nucors wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Steel, Inc., acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Ambassador Steel Corporation (Ambassador) for a cash purchase price of approximately $185 million. At closing, Harris Steel also repaid Ambassadors bank debt of approximately $136 million. Based in Auburn, Indiana, Ambassador is a fabricator and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products.
 
Also in August, Nucors wholly owned subsidiary, The David J. Joseph Company, completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of the American Compressed Steel operations of Secondary Resources, Inc. American Compressed Steel has facilities in Kansas City, St. Joseph and Sedalia, Missouri, and processes nearly 180,000 tons annually. DJJ is now operating these facilities under the Advantage Metals Recycling, LLC name.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In July, Nucor completed the acquisition of 50% of the stock of Duferdofin - Nucor S.r.l., for the purchase price of approximately $667.0 million. Duferdofin - Nucor S.r.l. operates a steel melting and bloom/billet caster in San Zeno as well as rolling mills in Pallanzeno and Giammoro. Total production in 2007 was approximately one million tons. A new merchant bar mill, which is expected to produce approximately 450,000 tons, is under construction at the Giammoro plant and is expected to be fully operational in late 2008.
 
In July, Nucor announced its plans to install a plate heat treating facility at its plate mill in Hertford County, North Carolina. The heat treat line will have an estimated annual capacity of 120,000 tons and will have the ability to produce heat treated plate from 3/16" through 2" thick. Total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $110 million

Discussions between Sidenor S. A. of Greece (ATH:SID) and Nucor concerning the possible formation of a joint venture between the companies continue in a cooperative and friendly nature.  However, the current turmoil in the world financial markets has delayed the completion of this effort.  Both Sidenor and Nucor expect to conclude our discussions when the future outlook becomes clearer.
 
Entering the fourth quarter, the global economy has been negatively impacted by the crisis in the financial markets. What started out as a seasonal slowdown - due to temporary global market disruptions such as the six-month China Olympics effect and the Middle Eastern religious holidays - has now been overwhelmed by a worldwide financial crisis that is unique in both size and scope in our lifetime.  The business environment has obviously become significantly more challenging for everyone including Nucor. There is little forward visibility on either the economy or our industry, even for the fourth quarter. These conditions are such that financial projections are not practical. Therefore, we will not be providing numerical or qualitative guidance at this time. We will give an update of our business at the normal time midway between our quarterly earnings releases.
 
What we can say is that 2008 will be another record year for Nucor and today our competitive position is stronger than ever, both here and globally. If recent initiatives by the worlds governments to stabilize financial markets are successful, then businesses should see significantly improved access to credit and resulting improved business conditions beginning early in 2009. We are still strong believers in the long-term strength of the global infrastructure build and the associated bull market for steel. It is this global growth in steel demand that will help drive Nucors growth and profitability.
