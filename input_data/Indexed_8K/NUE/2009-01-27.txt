CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, January 27, 2009  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today full year 2008 consolidated net earnings of a record $1.83 billion ($5.98 per diluted share), compared with net earnings of $1.47 billion ($4.94 per diluted share) in 2007.  Nucors consolidated net sales for 2008 increased 43% to a record $23.66 billion, compared with $16.59 billion in 2007.  Average sales price per ton increased 30% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 10% from 2007.
 
Consolidated net earnings of $105.9 million ($0.34 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 71% compared with $364.8 million ($1.26 per diluted share) earned in the fourth quarter of 2007 and decreased 86% from the $734.6 million ($2.31 per diluted share) earned in the third quarter of 2008.  Fourth quarter results were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in end-use demand for steel and the consumption of higher cost raw materials purchased earlier in the year.  Earnings were also decreased by $105.2 million in charges for impairment of non-current assets and an expense of $42.4 million for writing down inventory to the lower of cost or market.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Nucors consolidated net sales decreased 6% to $4.15 billion, compared with $4.40 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 and decreased 44% compared with $7.45 billion in the third quarter of 2008.  Average sales price per ton increased 30% from the fourth quarter of 2007 and decreased 13% from the third quarter of 2008.  Total tons shipped to outside customers were 4,294,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2008, a decrease of 27% from the fourth quarter of 2007 and a decrease of 36% from the third quarter of 2008.
 
For the full year 2008, the increases in sales and net earnings are attributable in part to the significant acquisitions made by Nucor in the last two years, including Harris Steel Group, Inc. (Harris) in March 2007 and The David J. Joseph Company (DJJ) in February 2008.  Nucor has also used these two companies as platforms for additional acquisitions to grow the steel rebar fabrication and scrap businesses.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used increased 53% from $285 in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $435 in the fourth quarter of 2008, and decreased 18% from $533 in the third quarter of 2008.  For the full year 2008, the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used was $438, an increase of 58% over $278 in 2007.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Nucor incurred a credit to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $81.2 million, compared with a charge of $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, and a charge of $140.0 million in the third quarter of 2008.  For the full year 2008, the LIFO charge was $341.8 million, compared with a charge of $194.3 million in 2007.
 
Total energy costs in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased $10 per ton from the fourth quarter of 2007 and increased $1 per ton from the third quarter of 2008.  For the full year of 2008, total energy costs increased $6 per ton from 2007.
 
 
 
Approximately $85 million of the impairment charge in the fourth quarter is for the impairment of our investment in the HIsmelt joint venture in Australia.  The HIsmelt process is a blast furnace replacement technology that has the potential to be a hot metal source for electric arc furnaces.  In December 2008, production at the HIsmelt plant was suspended due to market conditions.  Given the uncertain outlook for the pig iron market and the fact that the technology is not yet fully commercialized, management decided it was appropriate to recognize an impairment of this investment.
The team at the HIsmelt facility has made considerable progress since they began their work in 2005.   For that reason, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential for commercializing the HIsmelt technology.  The joint venture expects to resume operations when pig iron market conditions improve.
In December, Nucors board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per share payable on February 11, 2009 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2008.
 
The record sales and earnings achieved by Nucor in 2008 were accomplished in spite of the unprecedented economic and steel market conditions that we experienced in the fourth quarter, said Dan DiMicco, Nucors Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Our strong balance sheet and cash flow, our highly variable cost structure, our product diversification and, most importantly, our employees and the Nucor culture are all factors that make Nucor well positioned to survive this crisis.  Our team is focused on continuing Nucors long tradition of taking advantage of economic downturns to grow even stronger.
 
Entering the first quarter of 2009, conditions remain as challenging as they were in the fourth quarter.  The global economy is still paralyzed by the ongoing credit crunch.  In addition to weakened end-use demand, many customers also continue to reduce their inventories due to liquidity concerns. 
With dramatically lower production rates for the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter of 2009, our larger mills have higher cost scrap and scrap substitute inventories yet to be consumed.  These iron units  predominantly pig iron at our sheet mills  were purchased prior to last falls collapse in the economy and scrap pricing.
As in the prior quarter, there is little forward visibility on either the economy or our industry; therefore, we will not provide first quarter numerical guidance at this time.  We see the first quarter as again being very challenging, with only marginally better earnings than the fourth quarter of 2008.  We will give an update of our business during March.
