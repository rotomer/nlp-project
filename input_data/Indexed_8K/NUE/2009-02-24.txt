On February 18, 2009, the Compensation and Executive Development Committee of the Board of Directors approved a number of changes to the Companys incentive and severance plans following the Committees review of the potential payments employees would receive if terminated in connection with a change in control of the Company.
Nucors compensation plans are highly leveraged, meaning that a significant portion of an executives potential compensation is variable, and reward participants for performance over one and three year performance periods.  The incentive plans generally do not address how a change in control of the Company would affect the performance measures, periods or how a participant would be treated in the event of a termination.
The Committee determined that it is appropriate to provide certainty as to what employees would receive in the event of a change in control and approved the following changes to the Companys incentive and severance plans.  The changes do not result in executives receiving severance benefits in excess of three times their annual compensation or provide an excise tax gross up for any payments that would be considered excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
