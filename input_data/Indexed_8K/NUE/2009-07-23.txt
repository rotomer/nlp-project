CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, July 23, 2009  Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today a consolidated net loss of $133.3 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss of $189.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009, an improvement of 30%.  The results compare to net income of $580.8 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008.
 
In the first half of 2009, Nucor reported a consolidated net loss of $323.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $990.5 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, in the first half of last year.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, Nucors consolidated net sales decreased 7% to $2.48 billion compared with $2.65 billion in the first quarter of 2009 and decreased 65% compared with $7.09 billion in the second quarter of 2008.  Average sales price per ton decreased 16% from the first quarter of 2009 and decreased 34% from the second quarter of 2008.  Total tons shipped to outside customers were 4,116,000 tons in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 11% over the first quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 47% from the second quarter of 2008.
 
In the first half of 2009, Nucors consolidated net sales decreased 57% to $5.13 billion, compared with $12.06 billion in last years first half.  Average sales price per ton decreased 23% while total tons shipped to outside customers decreased 45% from the first half of 2008.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the second quarter of 2009 was $312, a decrease of 6% compared with $333 in the first quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 32% from $456 in the second quarter of 2008.  The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first half of 2009 was $322, a decrease of 19% from $396 in the first half of 2008.
 
  Nucor recorded a credit to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $125.0 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with a credit of $105.0 million in the first quarter of 2009 and a charge of $214.0 million in the second quarter of 2008.  The LIFO credit in the first half of 2009 was $230.0 million, compared with a charge of $283.0 million in the first half of 2008.
 
Overall steel mill utilization increased slightly from 45% in the first quarter of 2009 to 46% in the second quarter of 2009, and decreased from 95% in last years second quarter.  Utilization rates decreased from 94% in the first half of 2008 to 46% in the first half of 2009.  Monthly steel mill utilization rates increased each month during the second quarter, improving from 38% in April to 54% in June.  This improvement reversed the first quarter trend in which utilization rates decreased each month.
 
Total energy costs decreased approximately $4 per ton from the first quarter of 2009 due to decreased energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices combined with the slight increase in overall utilization.  Total energy costs increased approximately $5 per ton from the second quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009 and increased $8 per ton from the first half of 2008 to the first half of 2009 as a result of decreased utilization during the period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
As expected and as discussed in our guidance, second quarter results include a substantially greater burden than the first quarter from the accelerated consumption of high-cost pig iron inventories at our sheet mills.  This impact was partially offset by the strong focus on overall cost reductions by all members of the Nucor team.  We expect the overhang from the high-cost pig iron will continue to impact our results through the third quarter.  If we continue to see improvement in order entry and operating rates, our raw material destocking process would be accelerated with a corresponding improvement in earnings.
 
At The David J. Joseph Company (DJJ), total volumes in the second quarter (both scrap processing and brokerage) were approximately 50% of the prior year; however, in both cases, the volumes improved each month of the quarter and show a strong start to the third quarter.  In our downstream businesses, conditions continue to be challenging and recovery is expected to lag Nucors other businesses.  All of Nucors team members continue to capitalize on Nucors position of strength arising from our balance sheet, low-cost and highly flexible production capabilities, unrivaled product diversification and, most importantly, Nucors extremely productive and innovative work force.
 
Our liquidity position remains strong with $2.20 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and an untapped $1.3 billion revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012. 
 
In June, Nucors board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per share payable on August 11, 2009 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2009.  This dividend is Nucors one-hundred forty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend, a record we expect to continue.
 
The third quarter outlook suggests that, in spite of the continued strong negative impact of finishing up our high-cost pig iron inventories, we should see further earnings improvement in the quarter; however, the uncertainty in our economy is still very high.  Currently we are concerned that the marginal uptick in orders is not representative of an increase in real demand but more a result of both inventory adjustments and concern over rising prices.  We will again provide quantitative guidance after the midpoint between our quarterly earnings releases.
