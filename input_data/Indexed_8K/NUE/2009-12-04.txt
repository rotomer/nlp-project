Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On December 2, 2009, the Board of Directors of Nucor Corporation (the Company) approved an amendment to Nucors Certificate of Incorporation declassifying the Companys Board of Directors.  The Board will submit the proposed amendment to Nucors stockholders with a recommendation for their approval at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in May 2010.
Under the proposed amendment, the Board would not be fully declassified until 2013.  The current directors would continue to serve the remainder of the terms to which they were elected by the stockholders.  The class of directors with terms expiring at the 2010 Annual Meeting would be elected to three-year terms expiring at the 2013 Annual Meeting; the class of directors with terms expiring at the 2011 Annual Meeting would be elected to two-year terms expiring at the 2013 Annual Meeting and the class of directors with terms expiring at the 2012 Annual Meeting would be elected to one-year terms expiring at the 2013 Annual Meeting.  Beginning with the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and at each Annual Meeting thereafter, all directors would be elected annually.
