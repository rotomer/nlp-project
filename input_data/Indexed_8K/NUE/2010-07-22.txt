CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, July 22, 2010 -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today consolidated net earnings of $91.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2010. By comparison, Nucor reported net earnings of $31.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010 and a net loss of $133.3 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
 
In the first half of 2010, Nucor reported consolidated net earnings of $122.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $323.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in the first half of last year.
 
In the second quarter of 2010, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 15% to $4.20 billion compared with $3.65 billion in the first quarter of 2010 and increased 69% compared with $2.48 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Average sales price per ton increased 14% from the first quarter of 2010 and increased 25% from the second quarter of 2009. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 5,555,000 tons in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 1% over the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 35% over the second quarter of 2009.  Total second quarter steel mill shipments increased 53% over 2009s second quarter and were down 2% from the first quarter of 2010.  Second quarter downstream steel products shipments to outside customers increased 19% over the second quarter of 2009 and 25% over the first quarter of 2010.
 
In the first half of 2010, Nucor's consolidated net sales increased 53% to $7.85 billion, compared with $5.13 billion in last year's first half. Average sales price per ton increased 8% while total tons shipped to outside customers increased 41% over the first half of 2009.
 
The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the second quarter of 2010 was $373, an increase of 17% compared with $318 in the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 20% over $312 in the second quarter of 2009. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first half of 2010 was $345, an increase of 7% over $322 in the first half of 2009.
 
Nucor recorded a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting of $67.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with a charge of $24.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 and a credit of $125.0 million in the second quarter of 2009.  The LIFO charge in the first half of 2010 was $91.0 million, compared with a credit of $230.0 million in the first half of 2009.  The second quarter LIFO charge was higher than anticipated at the time we gave both our qualitative and quantitative guidance due to increasing scrap prices.
 
Overall operating rates at our steel mills in the second quarter (71%) were down slightly from the first quarter (73%), with some improvements at the beam and plate mills offset by declines at the sheet mills.  Steel mill utilization significantly increased from 46% in last year's second quarter, and increased from 46% in the first half of 2009 to 72% in the first half of 2010.
 
Total energy costs decreased approximately $2 per ton from the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to decreased energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices. Total energy costs decreased approximately $8 per ton from the second quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2010 and decreased $9 per ton from the first half of 2009 to the first half of 2010 mainly as a result of increased production.

Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities were $43.4 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $50.5 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $31.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. For the six-month period, pre-operating and start-up costs increased from $64.8 million in 2009 to $93.9 million in 2010. In 2010, these costs primarily related to the SBQ mill in Memphis, Tennessee, and the galvanizing line in Decatur, Alabama.
 
Our liquidity position remains strong with $1.14 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and an untapped $1.3 billion revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012.
 
In April, Nucor acquired a 50% interest in NuMit LLC, which invests in various steel and steel related activities, both in North America and globally.  As part of the agreement, Mitsui and Co. (U.S.A.), Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui and Co., Ltd., contributed 100% of Steel Technologies Inc.  Steel Technologies operates 23 sheet steel processing facilities throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  The purchase price of Nucors 50% interest was approximately $221.3 million and did not result in a significant amount of goodwill.  At closing, Nucor extended a $40.0 million loan and a $60.0 million line of credit (of which $54.0 million was drawn down immediately) to Steel Technologies.
 
In May, Nucor's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share payable on August 11, 2010 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2010.  This dividend is Nucor's 149 consecutive quarterly cash dividend, a record we expect to continue.

Operating results excluding LIFO improved significantly over the first quarter, primarily due to increased margins; however, the continuation of the upward trend experienced through the first half of the year is by no means clear at present.  There is a general slowdown taking place across all product lines as the overall economy has entered into a new period of uncertainty.  This is the case both in the U.S. and globally.  The most challenging markets for our products continue to be those associated with residential and non-residential construction, which continue to show little, if any, strength.  This is particularly true for our downstream businesses.  We will provide additional and more quantitative earnings guidance after the midpoint between our quarterly earnings releases.
 
Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Products produced include: carbon and alloy steel -- in bars, beams, sheet and plate; steel joists and joist girders; steel deck; fabricated concrete reinforcing steel; cold finished steel; steel fasteners; metal building systems; light gauge steel framing; steel grating and expanded metal; and wire and wire mesh. Nucor, through The David J. Joseph Company, also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HBI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. Nucor is North America's largest recycler.
