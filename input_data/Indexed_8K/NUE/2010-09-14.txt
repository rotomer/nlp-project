(a) On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors of Nucor Corporation (the "Corporation") approved certain amendments to the Corporation's Bylaws. The amendments were effective immediately upon their approval by the Board. Apart from non-substantive language and conforming changes and other technical and cross-reference edits, the Bylaws were amended in the manner summarized below.
 
 
Each of Article II, Section 3 and Article III, Section 1(b) has also been revised to provide that the notice required to be submitted by a stockholder proposing business for consideration or nominating a candidate for director at a meeting of the Corporation's stockholders include the following additional information: the name and address of any "Stockholder Associated Person," as such term is defined in the Corporation's Bylaws; the class and number of shares owned by any Stockholder Associated Person with respect to the Corporation's securities; any derivative positions, hedging transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding the proposing stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person has with respect to the Corporation's stock; a statement whether either the proposing stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person will deliver proxy materials to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal; and, with respect to any stockholder proposal, a description of any material interest of any Stockholder Associated Person in the proposal.
Article III, Section 1(b) has also been revised to provide that the notice required to be submitted by a stockholder nominating a candidate for election as a director at a meeting of the Corporation's stockholders include, as to each such nominee, the following additional
 
information: any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the nominee and a written statement executed by the nominee acknowledging that as a director of the Corporation, the nominee will owe a fiduciary duty under Delaware law with respect to the Corporation and its stockholders.
Article II, Section 3 has been revised to provide that no proposal presented by a stockholder that is not included in the Corporation's proxy statement shall be considered at any stockholders meeting except in accordance with the provisions of this section of the Corporation's Bylaws. In addition, this section has been revised to provide that business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may not be brought before the meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person takes any action contrary to the representations made pursuant to the provisions of this section or if the notice of the proposal applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. This section has also been amended to provide that the Chairman of the Board or the other director exercising the Chairman's powers and duties at a meeting has the authority to determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and that any such business shall not be conducted.

The stockholder list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder upon reasonable notice to the corporation for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 calendar days prior to the meeting during ordinary business hours at the corporation's principal place of business. Such list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any

stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the chairman of the board and shall be called by the chairman of the board or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the board of directors.

Section 6.
 The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting or as may be required by law, until a quorum shall be present or represented by proxy.

ARTICLE IV  NOTICES OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS, RECORD DATES AND WAIVER
Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the corporation's records. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be evidence of the facts stated therein.
Section 1.
prima facie
 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
Section 2.
 
record date is adopted by the board of directors and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 calendar days before the date of such meeting. If the board of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.
If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; , that the board of directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 2 at the adjourned meeting.
provided, however
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
 
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
Whenever notice is required to be given to stockholders, directors or other persons under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders or the board of directors, as the case may be, need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
Section 3.

Section 2.
 The officers of the corporation shall hold office until their successors shall be duly chosen and qualified, or until death, resignation or removal.

Unless otherwise determined by the board of directors, no holders of any shares of stock of the corporation, or of any rights, options or privileges to purchase shares of the stock of the corporation, or of any bonds, debentures, certificates of indebtedness or other securities, convertible into or exchangeable for shares of stock of the corporation, shall be entitled as of right to purchase or to subscribe for or receive any unissued or reacquired shares of stock of the corporation at any time authorized or any rights, options or privileges to purchase unissued or reacquired shares of stock of the corporation, or to purchase or subscribe for or receive any bonds, debentures, certificates of indebtedness, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the stock of the corporation, but any unissued or reacquired shares of stock, rights, options, privileges, bonds, debentures, certificates of indebtedness, or other securities, may be issued or reissued and disposed of by the board of directors to such persons as the board of directors may in its sole discretion determine without offering any thereof to holders of shares, rights, options, privileges, bonds, debentures, certificates of indebtedness, or other securities of the corporation.
C. The board of directors is hereby expressly authorized to issue the shares of Preferred Stock in series and to fix from time to time before issuance the number of shares to be included in each series and the designation, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of all shares of each series. The authority of the board of
 
directors with respect to each series shall include, without limitation, the determination of any or all of the following matters:
1. The number of shares constituting such series and the designation thereof to distinguish shares of such series from the shares of all other series;
2. The annual dividend rate on the shares of such series and whether such dividends shall be cumulative, and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends shall accumulate;
3. The redemption price or prices for shares of such series, if redeemable, and the terms and conditions of such redemption;
4. The preference, if any, of shares of such series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation;
5. The voting rights, if any, of shares of such series in addition to the voting rights prescribed by law and the terms of exercise of such voting rights;
6. The right, if any, of shares of such series to be converted into shares of any other series or class and the terms and conditions of such conversion; and
7. Any preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series.
The shares of each series may vary from the shares of any other series as to any matters, including the foregoing.
The corporation is to have perpetual existence.
A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be vested in the board of directors of the corporation.
B. The board of directors shall have power, without assent or vote of the stockholders: to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part of the property of the corporation; to determine the use and disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends.
C. The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders called for the
 
purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy) shall be valid and as binding upon the corporation and upon all stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the corporation, whether or not the contract or act would otherwise be open to question for any reason.
D. In addition to the powers herein or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of Delaware, of this Certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had not been made.
A. The number of directors of the corporation shall be such as from time to time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
B. At all elections of directors of the corporation at which a stockholder is entitled to vote, each such stockholder shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which (except for this provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number to be voted for, as he may see fit.
C. Until the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors of the corporation shall continue to be classified and divided into three classes, each class to be as equal in number as possible. Each director who is serving as a director immediately following the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, or is thereafter elected a director, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she has previously been elected, and until his or her successor shall be duly elected and qualified, or until death, resignation or removal. At the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the class of directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a two-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, the successors of the class of directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. At the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, and at each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
D. After the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock, no special meeting of stockholders of the corporation may be called by or on behalf of the stockholders of the corporation for a purpose of voting to remove one or more directors without cause, and stockholders may not act by written consent in lieu of a meeting to remove one or more directors without cause.
 
A. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
B. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
C. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraph A or B of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
D. Any indemnification under paragraph A and B of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in said paragraph A or B. Such determination shall be made (1) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders. If such determination is adverse to the director, officer, employee or agent, such person may contest such determination and if a court should finally decide that indemnification is proper in the circumstances (which decision shall bind the corporation) or if such contest is settled before such final decision, then the director, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified in addition to that provided under paragraph A
 
and B of this Article, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in contesting such determination.
E. Expenses incurred by any person who may have a right of indemnification under this Article in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the board of directors upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person, to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation pursuant to this Article.
F. The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to be benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
G. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article or of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
H. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law from time to time in effect, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said law from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities and other matters referred to in or covered by said law.
A. If any Other Entity is the Beneficial Owner of more than ten per cent (10%) of the outstanding Voting Shares of the corporation, then the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of four-fifths (4/5) of the outstanding Voting Shares shall be required for the following: (i) the adoption of any agreement, plan or arrangement for the merger or consolidation of the corporation or any Subsidiary with any such Other Entity, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other disposition, either directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of more than ten per cent (10%) of the Assets of the corporation or any Subsidiary to any such Other Entity, or (iii) the issuance or transfer by the corporation, either directly or indirectly, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a number of Voting Shares (including as such, Voting Shares which may be issued or transferred upon the conversion or redemption of any other securities of the corporation) of the corporation greater than ten per cent (10%) of the number of outstanding Voting Shares of the corporation immediately prior thereto in exchange for the securities or assets of any such Other Entity. Such affirmative vote or written consent shall be in addition to the vote or consent of the holders of the stock of the corporation otherwise required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation or any agreement or contract to which the corporation is a party.
B. As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
 
"Other Entity" means any person, firm, corporation or other entity acting individually, or any persons, firms, corporations or other entities, or any combination thereof, acting in concert, or any one or more of such persons, firms, corporations or other entities acting in concert; provided, however, that "Other Entity" shall not mean a Subsidiary of the corporation whose certificate of incorporation contains provisions substantially similar to the provisions of this Article IX and Article XI of this Certificate of Incorporation; and provided further that "Other Entity" shall not include any director, officer or employee of the corporation unless such individual is also an Affiliate or Associate of any such other person, firm, corporation or other entity.

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this corporation and its creditors or any class of them, and/or between this corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the state of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of this corporation or of any creditor or stockholders thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for this corporation under the provisions of Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such matter as the said court directs.

(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.

(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all
 
such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock.

Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the ) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 5,000 (the ). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Capital Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Preferred Stock and holders of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Capital Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock. Neither merger, consolidation, etc. shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up for purposes of this Section 6.
 
(C) In the event the corporation shall (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 7.

In the event the corporation shall at any time (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Exhibit 99.1
General.
As of July 3, 2010, our authorized capital stock consists of 800,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.40 per share, and 250,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $4.00 per share, 200,000 shares of which have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. As of July 3, 2010, 315,560,705 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding (not including treasury shares) and none of our preferred stock was issued and outstanding.
The following description of our common stock and provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Restated Certificate of Incorporation") and By-laws are only summaries and we encourage you to review complete copies of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, which we have previously filed with the SEC.
The holders of our common stock are entitled to have dividends declared in cash, property, or other securities out of any of our net profits or net assets legally available therefor as and when declared by our board of directors. This dividend right is subject to any preferential dividend rights we may grant to the persons who hold preferred stock, if any. In the event of the liquidation or dissolution of our business, the holders of common stock will be entitled to receive ratably the balance of net assets available for distribution after payment of any liquidation or distribution preference payable with respect to any then outstanding shares of our preferred stock. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote with respect to matters brought before the stockholders, except for the election of any directors with respect to which stockholders have cumulative voting rights.
Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NUE."
Delaware Anti-Takeover Law and Certain Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Law Provisions.
The provisions of Delaware law, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company, including takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock.
Delaware Law
We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the time that the person became an interested stockholder, unless:
 
 
A "business combination" is defined generally to include mergers or consolidations between a Delaware corporation and an "interested stockholder," transactions with an "interested stockholder" involving the assets or stock of the corporation or any majority-owned subsidiary, transactions which increase an "interested stockholder's" percentage ownership of stock of the corporation or any majority-owned subsidiary, and receipt of various financial benefits from the corporation or any majority-owned subsidiary. In general, an "interested stockholder" is defined as any person or entity that is the beneficial owner of at least 15% of a corporation's outstanding voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within the prior three years.
A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws resulting from a stockholders' amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares. However, we have not opted out of this provision. The statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change-in-control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Law Provisions
Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws provide:
 
 
 
 
 
Limitations of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Article VIII of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provide that any person who serves or has served as our director, officer, employee or agent, or in such capacity at our request of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent permitted by law against (i) expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was acting in such capacity if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful and (ii) expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonable incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was acting in such capacity if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of such person's duty to the corporation.
Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also state that indemnification provisions described above are not exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which any person may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. We may pay expenses incurred by our directors and officers in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding for which such persons may have a right of indemnification prior to the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding if we receive an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay all amounts advanced unless such person is entitled to be indemnified by us as described above.
Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) for willful or negligent conduct in paying dividends or repurchasing stock out of other than lawfully available funds or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. No such provision
shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any action or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective.
We maintain insurance for the benefit of directors and officers insuring them against liabilities under the Securities Act and claims that are made against them by reason of any wrongful act (as defined) committed in their capacity as directors or officers.
Rights Plan.
In 2001, our board of directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan ("Plan") in which one right ("Right") was distributed as a dividend for each Nucor common share outstanding. The Plan was amended in 2006 to adjust the purchase price of the Rights for stock splits effected since adoption of the Plan. Each Right entitles Nucor common stockholders to purchase, under certain conditions, one five-thousandth of a share of newly authorized Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock"). One five-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock is intended to be the economic equivalent of one share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events, the Rights are represented by and traded in tandem with our common stock. Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding common shares or commences a tender or exchange offer, upon the consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding common shares. Upon such an event, the Rights enable dilution of the acquiring person's or group's interest by providing that other holders of our common stock may purchase, at an exercise price of $150, our common stock, or in the discretion of the board of directors, Preferred Stock, having double the value of such exercise price. We will be entitled to redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right under certain circumstances set forth in the Plan. The Rights themselves have no voting power and will expire on March 8, 2011, unless earlier exercised, redeemed or exchanged. Each one five-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock has the same voting rights as one share of our common stock, and each share of Preferred Stock has 5,000 times the voting power of one share of our common stock.
