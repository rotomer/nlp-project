(d) On September 11, 2012, the Board of Directors of Nucor Corporation (the "Corporation") elected Raymond J. Milchovich, former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Foster Wheeler AG, to the Corporation's Board of Directors with a term expiring at the Corporation's 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. Concurrent with his election as a director, Mr. Milchovich was appointed to the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Executive Development Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Milchovich and any other persons pursuant to which he was selected as a director. Additionally, there are no transactions involving the Corporation and Mr. Milchovich that the Corporation would be required to report pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Mr. Milchovich will receive compensation in accordance with the Corporation's standard compensation arrangements for non-employee directors, which are described under the caption "Director Compensation" in the Corporation's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2012, as adjusted by the Board of Directors from time to time.
A copy of the news release announcing Mr. Milchovich's election is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
(a) On September 11, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved an amendment to Article III, Section 1(a) of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective immediately. As amended, Section 1(a) of Article III provides, in relevant part, that "the number of directors which shall constitute the whole board of directors shall be not less than three nor more than eleven, the precise number to be determined from time to time by resolution of the board of directors." The Corporation's Amended and Restated Bylaws previously provided for the number of directors to be "not less than three nor more than ten."
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Bylaws as adopted and effective as of September 11, 2012, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Section 3.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice of any proposal to be presented by a stockholder at any annual meeting of stockholders shall be delivered in writing to the secretary of the corporation not less than 120 calendar days nor more than 150 calendar days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in
 
the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days before or more than 60 calendar days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th calendar day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th calendar day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 calendar days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the delivery of a stockholder's notice under this Section 3. To be timely, a stockholder's notice of any proposal to be presented by a stockholder at any special meeting of stockholders shall be delivered in writing to the secretary of the corporation not earlier than 150 calendar days before the date of the special meeting nor later than the later of 120 calendar days before the date of the special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the special meeting was first made by the corporation. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a special meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the delivery of a stockholder's notice under this Section 3.

The chairman of the meeting shall determine and declare to the meeting whether a proposal was made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should determine that it was not so made, he shall so declare to the meeting and such proposal shall be disregarded.
 
No business proposed to be brought by a stockholder may be brought before the meeting if such stockholder or a Stockholder Associated Person, as applicable, takes any action contrary to the representations made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3 applicable to such business or if the notice of the proposal applicable to such business contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that such business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3, and, if the chairman of the meeting should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be conducted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 3; provided, however, that any references herein to the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to stockholder proposals pursuant to this Section 3. Nothing in this Section 3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the corporation's stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act.
of any stockholder means (A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such stockholder, (B) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given in accordance with Article IV of these bylaws stating the place, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, such notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.
Section 4.

The stockholder list shall be arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder upon reasonable notice to the corporation for any purpose germane to the
Section 5.
provided
however
 
meeting for a period of at least 10 calendar days prior to the meeting during ordinary business hours at the corporation's principal place of business. Such list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the chairman of the board and shall be called by the chairman of the board or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the board of directors. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.
Section 6.
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting or as may be required by law, until a quorum shall be present or represented by proxy. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented by proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
Section 7.
 
When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power, present in person or represented by proxy, shall decide any question brought before the meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law or of the certificate of incorporation or of the bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
Section 8.
Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in the stockholder's name on the stock books of the corporation as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting. At all elections of directors, each stockholder of the corporation having voting power shall have the right of cumulative voting as provided in the certificate of incorporation.
Section 9.
At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed (i) by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder or (ii) by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL. A written proxy may be in the form of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission that sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the person having the right to vote at the meeting.
Section 10.
 
Before any meeting of stockholders, the corporation shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment and make a written report thereof. The inspector or inspectors of election shall have the duties and powers prescribed or authorized, as the case may be, in Section 231 of the DGCL.
Section 11.
At any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting or as may be required by law. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

ARTICLE IV  NOTICES OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS, RECORD DATES AND WAIVER
Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the corporation's records. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
Section 1.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 calendar days before the date of such meeting. If the board of directors so fixes a
Section 2.
 
date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.
If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 2 at the adjourned meeting.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 10 calendar days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted. Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall deliver in writing to the secretary of the corporation a notice requesting that a record date be fixed for such purpose. Such notice must contain the information set forth in this Section 3. The
Section 3.
 
board of directors shall have until the end of the tenth day after receipt of such notice to determine in good faith the validity of the notice, and if appropriate, adopt a resolution fixing the record date for such purpose. If the corporation shall have received a valid notice to fix a record date for such purpose and the board of directors shall have failed to fix a record date for such purpose before the end of the tenth day after receipt of such notice, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed by applicable Delaware law; except that, if prior action by the board of directors is required under the provisions of Delaware law, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Any stockholder's notice required by this Section 3 shall be valid and effective only if delivered to the secretary of the corporation and only if it sets forth (a) as to any action (other than the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the corporation) that the stockholder proposes to take by consent, a description of such action (and, if such action includes a proposal to amend either the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the text of the proposed amendment), a brief statement of the reasons for such stockholder's proposal for taking such action, and other information required by Section 3(iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of Article II; and (b) as to the nomination of any person for election or reelection as a director of the corporation that the stockholder proposes to take by consent, the information set forth in Section 1(b)(a) and Section 1(b)(b) of Article III. The corporation may require the stockholder requesting a record date for proposed stockholder action by consent to furnish additional information to the extent it may reasonably be required to determine the validity of the request for a record date.
 
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
Section 4.
Whenever notice is required to be given to stockholders, directors or other persons under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders or the board of directors, as the case may be, need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
