"Q2 was challenging and disappointing as the desktop GPU segment declined significantly as a result of several unusual market events," stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. "A major highlight, however, was shipping significant volumes of our GeForce 6800, the industry's first Shader Model 3.0 GPU. We have once again taken the technology lead with GeForce 6 and are aggressively driving it deeper into the mainstream and value desktop, notebook and professional business segments. Our bold strategy to bring a fundamentally new architecture to the PCI Express transition has resulted in winning key design wins in each segment."
