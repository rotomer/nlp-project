SECTION 1 - Registrants Business and Operations
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 7, 2005 and February 11, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) of NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) authorized the cash payment of variable compensation awards in respect of its fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 (Fiscal Year 2005). Cash awards for the named executive officers were based on metrics established by the Compensation Committee in February 2004. The amount of variable compensation awards was based one half on individual performance through the achievement of previously established key objectives and the other half was based on corporate performance through the achievement of revenue and gross margin targets. The Compensation Committee did not award variable compensation awards based on corporate performance as the Company did not achieve the previously established revenue and gross margin targets for Fiscal Year 2005. The following table sets forth the cash bonuses to be paid to the named executive officers as a result of their individual performance during Fiscal Year 2005:
The Company will pay the variable performance awards during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2006.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
