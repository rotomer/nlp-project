Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents
 
  The corporation shall indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XII, executive officers shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other applicable law; that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive officers.
(a)
Directors and Executive Officers
.
provided, however,
 
   The corporation shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person (other than as specified in clause (a) above) to such officers or other persons as the Board of Directors shall determine.
(b)
Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents
.
 
   The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or executiveofficer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding; , that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or an executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or an executive officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication) that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise.
(c)
Expenses
.
 
provided, however
 
19
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 46, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
 
   Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive officers under this Section 46 shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Section 46 to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executiveofficer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.Neither the failure of the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder or brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of any undertaking, the burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses under this Section 46 or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
(d)
Enforcement
.
 
 
 
20
   The rights conferred on any person by this Section 46 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law.
(e)
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
.
 
   The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

   Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Section 46 that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
(h)
Amendments
.
 
   If this Section 46 or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Section 46 that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section 46 shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SANTA CLARA, CA
MARCH 6, 2006
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. NVIDIA also announced that its Board has approved an increase in the Companys existing share repurchase program.
Stock Split
The stock split will entitle each stockholder of record at the close of business on Friday, March 17, 2006 to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held. The additional shares resulting from the stock split are expected to be distributed by the transfer agent on or about Thursday, April 6, 2006. Upon the completion of the stock split, NVIDIA will have approximately 360 million shares of common stock outstanding.
Stock Repurchase Program
The Company also announced a $400,000,000 increase to the original stock repurchase program it announced in August 2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700,000,000, of which the Company has purchased approximately $263,000,000.
The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at the Companys discretion. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. As of January 29, 2006, NVIDIA had over $950,000,000 of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.
