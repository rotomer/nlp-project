SECTION 1 - Registrants Business and Operations
 
Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(a)
 
On March 7, 2006, the Compensation Committee of Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved an amendment to our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Plan. The amendments to the Plan:
The foregoing summary of changes contained in the Plan is qualified in its entirety by the Plan itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The amendments to the Plan did not require stockholder approval and were effective upon approval by our Compensation Committee.
(b)
 
On March 7, 2006,
the Compensation Committee approved cash bonus awards earned during fiscal 2006 by our executive officers under our Fiscal Year 2006 Variable Compensation Plan Management Bonus Plan. The bonus awards are based upon the achievement of performance goals, which were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee in May 2005. The bonus awards will be paid in fiscal 2007.
SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On March 9, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to Article IV, Section 15 of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or the Amendment, to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
In addition, if a nominee who already serves as a director is not elected, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance or other committee designated by the Board of Directors will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board of Director's decision. If the failure of a nominee to be elected at the annual meeting results in a vacancy on the Board of Directors, that vacancy can be filled by action of the Board of Directors.
The foregoing summary of changes contained in the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the Amendment itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.4 and is incorporated herein by reference.

At any such time or times that the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan are insufficient for the purpose of making one or more of the non-discretionary grants of options specified in Section 5 of the Directors Plan, then, without any further action of the Board, the number of shares of Common Stock remaining in the share reserve of the Directors Plan shall be applied to such non-discretionary grants on a pro rated basis, and any additional number of shares of Common Stock required for such non-discretionary grants of options shall be deemed to have been made under this Plan but on the terms and conditions specified in the Directors Plan.

7
(c)
  
Consideration.
The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised, or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of the grant of the Option, (a) by delivery to the Company of other Common Stock, (b) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (which may include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of other Common Stock) with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to subsection 6(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board. In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be compounded at least annually and shall be charged at the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid (i) the imputation of interest income to the holder of the Option under any applicable provisions of the Code, and (ii) the classification of the Option as a liability for financial accounting purposes.

An Incentive Stock Option and, prior to the Listing Date, a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Incentive Stock Option is granted only by such person. After the Listing Date, a Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be transferable to the extent provided in the Option Agreement. If the Nonstatutory Stock Option does not provide for transferability, then the Nonstatutory Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Option is granted only by such person.

(e)
  
Vesting.
The total number of shares of stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). The Option Agreement may provide that from time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option became vested but was not fully exercised. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised which may be based upon performance or other criteria as the Board may deem appropriate. The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f)
  
Minimum Vesting Prior To The Listing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection, Options granted prior to the Listing Date shall provide for vesting of the total number of shares at a rate of at least twenty percent (20%) per year over five (5) years from the date the Option was granted, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment. However, in the case of such Options granted to officers, directors or consultants (within the meaning of Section 260.140.41 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations), the Option may become fully exercisable, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment, at any time or during any period established by the Company; for example, the vesting provision of the Option may provide for vesting of less than twenty percent (20%) per year of the total number of shares subject to the Option.
 
8
(g)
  
Termination Of Continuous Service.
In the event an Optionee's Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability), the Optionee may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement, which, for Options granted prior to the Listing Date, shall not be less than thirty (30) days unless such termination is for cause), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
 
(h)
  
Disability Of Optionee.
In the event an Optionee's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionee's disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option, (to the extent such Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement, which, for Options granted prior to the Listing Date, shall not be less than six (6) months) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
