SANTA CLARA, CAMay 11, 2006
NVIDIA Corporation (Nasdaq: NVDA) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended April 30, 2006.
For the first quarter of
fiscal 200
7, revenue increased to a record $681.8 million, compared to $583.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of 17 percent.  Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $90.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $64.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 includes stock-based compensation expense of $23.0 million as a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), during the quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2007, which excludes SFAS 123R stock-based compensation and related tax differences, was $111.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share.
All share numbers and per share amounts set forth in this release and the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Companys two-for-one stock split effected April 6, 2006 through the payment of stock dividends to the holders of record on March 17, 2006.
 
We experienced growth in each of our businesses - GPU, MCP, handheld GPU, and consumer electronics - resulting in record revenue for the first quarter, stated Jen-Hsun Huang, president and CEO of NVIDIA. We also entered multiple new product cycles during the quarter, continuing our leadership in each of the markets we serve. As we move further into the new fiscal year, the growth drivers we outlined at our Analyst Day in March, which include the adoption of Microsoft Vista, high-definition video, and the launch of the Sony PlayStation3, will continue to accelerate and give us the opportunity for another strong year of growth.
First Quarter Fiscal 2007 Highlights:
NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter fiscal 2007 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:00 P.M. Pacific Time (5:00 P.M. Eastern Time). To listen to the call, please dial (706) 679-0543. A live Web cast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be held at the NVIDIA investor relations Web site
http://nvidia.com/ir
and at
http://www.streetevents.com
. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone by calling 800-642-1687 (or 706-645-9291), passcode 8372204, until May 18, 2006. The Web cast will be recorded and available for replay until the Companys conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter fiscal 2007.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per share, and other non-GAAP line items from the Consolidated Statements of Income, including cost of revenue information, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses (including research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses) and income tax expense. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods that did not include SFAS 123R, we have shown a non-GAAP presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Income as reconciled against the GAAP presentation. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude SFAS 123R stock-based compensation and related tax differences. We believe the presentation of our non-GAAP results enhances the user's overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial results is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
