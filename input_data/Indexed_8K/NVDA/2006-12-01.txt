SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 29, 2006,   NVIDIA Corporation (the Company) filed an amended Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2006, a Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006 and a Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 30, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it described that it had identified a number of occasions on which the Company had used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes for stock option grants made in certain prior periods. As a result of this determination, the Company launched a tender offer pursuant to a Schedule TO which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 29, 2006. The tender offer is being made with respect to certain stock option grants held by existing employees for which the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the corrected measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes exceeded the exercise price of the stock option grant, but only to the extent that such stock option grants may be subject to potential tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the proposed regulations issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service thereunder. Under the terms of the tender offer as approved by the Board of Directors, no executive officer or member of the Companys Board of Directors is eligible to participate. Mr. Huang, a member of the Companys Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, holds three stock option grants potentially subject to tax under Section 409A. On November 27, 2006, the Board of Directors (with Mr. Huang abstaining) elected to amend Mr. Huangs affected three stock option grants to increase the grant price of such options to equal the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the new measurement date as determined for financial accounting and reporting purposes. The increased prices are set forth in the table below. Mr. Huang consented to such amendments.
