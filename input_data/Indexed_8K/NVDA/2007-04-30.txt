SECTION 5 - Corporate Governance and Management
 
 
On April 24, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan, subject to approval by our stockholders. The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards, collectively, the stock awards. Stock awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan to our employees, directors and consultants.
 
If approved by stockholders at our 2007 Annual Meeting, which is scheduled for June 21, 2007, the 2007 Plan will consolidate and replace all of our outstanding equity incentive plans. Specifically, the 2007 Plan will succeed our 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, our 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, our 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, which we assumed when we acquired PortalPlayer, Inc. in January 2007. We refer to all our outstanding equity incentive plans together as the Prior Plans.
 
The maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2007 Plan is 101,845,177 shares, which is equal to (i) all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (including shares subject to issuance under outstanding stock awards previously granted under the Prior Plans), which amount is approximately 91,978,851 shares as of April 6, 2007, and (ii) a number of shares, to be determined as of the date the 2007 Plan is approved by our stockholders, that when added to the number of shares then remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans, results in a total share reserve of 101,845,177 shares of common stock, which, as of April 6, 2007, was approximately 9,666,326 shares. The shares of common stock subject to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan (including any awards granted under the Prior Plans) that expire, are forfeited because of a failure to vest, or otherwise terminate without being exercised in full will return to the 2007 Plan and be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. The shares issued upon the exercise of awards outstanding under the Prior Plans will reduce the shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.
 
In the event of a corporate transaction or a change of control, outstanding stock awards under the 2007 Plan may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) any stock awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction will become fully vested and exercisable and will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the transaction, and (b) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the transaction.
 
The Board or a duly appointed committee thereof may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time. The 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate immediately prior to the 10
th
anniversary of the date it was adopted by the Compensation Committee. No rights may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. The Board or a duly appointed committee thereof may amend or modify the 2007 Plan at any time, subject to any required stockholder approval. To the extent required by applicable law or regulation, and except as otherwise provided in the 2007 Plan, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that (a) materially increases the number of shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, (b) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive stock awards under the 2007 Plan, (c) materially increases the benefits accruing to the participants under the 2007 Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares of common stock may be issued or purchased under the 2007 Plan, (d) materially extends the term of the 2007 Plan, or (e) expands the types of awards available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.
 
The 2007 Plan is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the 2007 Plan.
 
SECTION 9 - Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Item 9.01 Exhibits.

1.
  
GENERAL.
 
(a)
  
Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans.
The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the 
1998 Plan
), the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation 2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the 
Prior Plans
). Following the Effective Date, no additional stock awards shall be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards shall be subject to the terms of this Plan except as follows: from the Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the 
Transition Date
) (during which time the Company anticipates taking such steps as are
necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States
), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan covering up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are
foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States
(such 100,000 share reserve, the 
Foreign Transition Reserve
). On the Effective Date, all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (such reserve, including the Foreign Transition Reserve and shares subject to issuance under outstanding options and other stock awards that were previously granted under the Prior Plans, the 
Prior Plan Reserve
) shall become available for issuance under the Plan;
provided, however
, that the issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of shares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards granted following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign Transition Reserve) shall occur from this Plan and shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan as provided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise or settlement shall become available for issuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(b) below. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans shall remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.
 
(b)
  
Eligible Award Recipients.
The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.
 
(c)
  
Available Awards.
The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (ii) Nonstatutory Stock Options, (iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance Cash Awards, and (viii) Other Stock Awards.
 
(d)
  
Purpose.
The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive Awards as set forth in Section
1(b)
, to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any Affiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the Common Stock through the granting of Stock Awards.
 
2.
  
ADMINISTRATION.
 
(a)
  
Administration by Board.
The Board shall administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees, as provided in Section
2(c)
.
 
(b)
  
Powers of Board.
The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
 
(i)
  
To determine from time to time (A) which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Awards; (B) when and how each Award shall be granted; (C) what type or combination of types of Award shall be granted; (D) the provisions of each Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive cash or Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and (E) the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Award shall be granted to each such person.
 
(ii)
  
To construe and interpret the Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement or in the written terms of a Performance Cash Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan or Award fully effective.
 
(iii)
  
To settle all controversies regarding the Plan and Awards granted under it.
 
(iv)
  
To accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.
 
(v)
  
To suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted while the Plan is in effect except with the written consent of the affected Participant.
 
(vi)
  
To amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable, including, without limitation, relating to Incentive Stock Options and certain nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and/or to bring the Plan or Stock Awards granted under the Plan into compliance therewith, subject to the limitations, if any, of applicable law. However, except as provided in Section
9(a)
relating to Capitalization Adjustments, stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment of the Plan that either (i) materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares of Common Stock may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, or (v) expands the types of Awards available for issuance under the Plan, but only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements.

(vii)
  
To submit any amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of (i) Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to Covered Employees, (ii) Section 422 of the Code regarding Incentive Stock Options, or (iii) Rule 16b-3.

provided however,
that, the rights under any Award shall not be impaired by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the affected Participant, and (ii) such Participant consents in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the limitations of applicable law, if any, and without the affected Participants consent, the Board may amend the terms of any one or more Awards if necessary to maintain the qualified status of the Award as an Incentive Stock Option or to bring the Award into compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the related guidance thereunder.

The Board may retain the authority to concurrently administer the Plan with the Committee and may, at any time, revest in the Board some or all of the powers previously delegated.

.

Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuance consists of (i) all of the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans (including shares subject to issuance under outstanding stock awards previously granted under the Prior Plans)  and (ii) a number of shares, to be determined as of the date this 2007 Plan is approved by the stockholders, that when added to the number of shares then remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans, results in a total reserve of 101,845,177 shares.
 
(b)
  
Reversion of Shares to the Share Reserve
.
 
 
(i)
  
Shares Available For Subsequent Issuance
. If any (x) Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, (y) shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Award are forfeited to or repurchased by the Company at their original exercise or purchase price pursuant to the Companys reacquisition or repurchase rights under the Plan, including any forfeiture or repurchase caused by the failure to meet a contingency or condition required for the vesting of such shares, or (z) Stock Award is settled in cash, then the shares of Common Stock not issued under such Stock Award, or forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
 
(ii)
  
Shares Not Available for Subsequent Issuance
. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because the Stock Award is exercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock Award (
i.e.
, net exercised) or an appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares subject to the Stock Award that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld in satisfaction of the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, or the issuance of shares under a Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award pursuant to Section
8(g)
, the number of shares that are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. If the exercise price of any Stock Award is satisfied by tendering shares of Common Stock held by the Participant (either by actual delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tendered shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
 
(c)
  
Incentive Stock Option Limit.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3(c)
, subject to the provisions of Section
9(a)

9(a)
relating to Capitalization Adjustments, at such time as the Company may be subject to the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, no Employee shall be eligible to be granted during any calendar year Stock Awards whose value is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise or strike price of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Award is granted covering more than two million (2,000,000)
 
shares of Common Stock.
 
 
(e)
  
Full Value Awards
. In general, with respect to Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Stock Awards, Performance Cash Awards that are settled in Common Stock, and Other Stock Awards (
Full Value Awards
), the vesting period, together with the holding period after issuance, of such Full Value Awards shall be not less than three (3) years (or one (1) year, in the case of Full Value Awards that are granted or vest upon the achievement of pre-determined performance criteria);
provided, however
, that the lapsing of such periods may be accelerated in connection with a Corporate Transaction and/or Change in Control. Full Value Awards that do not meet these guidelines shall be limited to five (5%) percent of the 2007 Plan Reserve.

. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees of the Company or a parent corporation or subsidiary corporation thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code). Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants.
 
(b)
  
Ten Percent Stockholders.
A Ten Percent Stockholder shall not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the exercise price of such Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
 
 
(c)
  
Consultants.
A Consultant shall be eligible for the grant of a Stock Award only if, at the time of grant, a Form S-8 Registration Statement under the Securities Act or a successor or similar form under the Securities Act (
Form S-8
) is available to register either the offer or the sale of the Companys securities to such Consultant because of the nature of the services that the Consultant is providing to the Company, because the Consultant is a natural person, or because of any other rule governing the use of Form S-8.
 
5.
  
OPTION PROVISIONS.
 
Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. All Options shall be separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate certificate or certificates shall be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option, then the Option shall be a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical;
provided, however
, that each Option Agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option Agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a)
  
Term.
Subject to the provisions of Section
4(b)
regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of its grant or such shorter period specified in the Option Agreement (the 
Expiration Date
).
 
(b)
  
Exercise Price.
Subject to the provisions of Section
4(b)
regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, and notwithstanding anything in the Option Agreement to the contrary, the exercise price of each Option shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner consistent with the provisions of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code (whether or not such options are Incentive Stock Options).
 
(c)
  
Consideration.
The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by the Board in its sole discretion, by any combination of the methods of payment set forth below. The Board shall have the authority to grant Options that do not permit all of the following methods of payment (or otherwise restrict the ability to use certain methods) and to grant Options that require the consent of the Company to utilize a particular method of payment. The methods of payment permitted by this Section
5(c)
are:
 
(i)
  
by cash, check, bank draft or money order payable to the Company;
 
(ii)
  
pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board that, prior to the issuance of the stock subject to the Option, results in either the receipt of cash (or check) by the Company or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds;
 
(iii)
  
by delivery to the Company (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock;
 
(iv)
  
by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price;
provided, however,
that the Company shall accept a cash or other payment from the Participant to the extent of any remaining balance of the aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued;
provided, further,
that shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option and will not be exercisable thereafter to the extent that (A) shares are used to pay the exercise price pursuant to the net exercise, (B) shares are delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise, and (C) shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; or
 
(v)
  
in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board.
 
(d)
  
Transferability of Options.
The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on the transferability of Options as the Board shall determine. If the Board determines that an Option shall be transferable, the Option shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate. In the absence of such a determination by the Board to the contrary, the following restrictions on the transferability of Options shall apply:
 
(i)
  
Restrictions on Transfer.
No ISO granted under this Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Nonqualified Stock Options shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionholder only by the Optionholder;
provided, however
, that the Board may, in its sole discretion, permit transfer of the Option in a manner consistent with applicable tax and securities laws upon the Optionholders request.
 
(ii)
  
Domestic Relations Orders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order,
provided, however,
that an Incentive Stock Option may be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option as a result of such transfer.
 
(iii)
  
Beneficiary Designation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionholder may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form provided by or otherwise satisfactory to the Company and any broker designated by the Company to effect Option exercises, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionholder, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. In the absence of such a designation, the executor or administrator of the Optionholders estate shall be entitled to exercise the Option.
 
(e)
  
Vesting of Options Generally.
The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfaction of Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary;
provided, however
, that in all cases, in the event that an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of his or her death, then the Option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination of Continuous Service. The provisions of this Section
5(e)
are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares of Common Stock as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
 
(f)
  
Termination of Continuous Service.
Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Option Agreement or other agreement between the Optionholder and the Company, in the event that an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionholders death or Disability), the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination of Continuous Service) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date ninety (90) days following the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(g)
  
Extension of Termination Date.
If the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service (other than upon the Optionholders death or Disability) would either (i) be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or (ii) subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the expiration of a period of ninety (90) days after the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements and would not subject the Optionholder to short-swing liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or (B) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.
 
(h)
  
Disability of Optionholder.
In the event that an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholders Disability, the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination of Continuous Service), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination of Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination of Continuous Service, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(i)
  
Death of Optionholder.
In the event that (i) an Optionholders Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Optionholders death (which termination event shall give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), or (ii) the Optionholder dies within the period (if any) specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of the Optionholders Continuous Service for a reason other than death (which event shall not give rise to acceleration of vesting as described in Section 5(e) above), then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of death) by the Optionholders estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionholders death, but only within the period ending on the earlier of (A) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (B) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after the Optionholders death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Option Agreement (as applicable), the Option shall terminate.
 
(j)
  
Non-Exempt Employees
. No Option granted to an Employee that is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be first exercisable for any shares of Common Stock until at least six (6) months following the date of grant of the Option. The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay.
 
6.
  
PROVISIONS OF STOCK AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS.
 
(a)
  
Restricted Stock Awards.

provided, however,
that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Stock Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.

If the Board determines that the terms of a Stock Award do not reflect the appropriate exercise, strike or purchase price on the appropriate date of grant in accordance with the requirements of the Plan, the terms of the Stock Award shall be automatically corrected to reflect the appropriate price or other terms provided for under the Plan, as determined by the Board, without the need for consent of the Participant;

(f)
  
Investment Assurances.
The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Common Stock under any Stock Award, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participants knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring Common Stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participants own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (A) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (B) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws.

In addition, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement (including but not limited to increasing the exercise price of an Award to the extent required for the avoidance of the tax consequences set forth in Section 409A(a)(1)) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.
