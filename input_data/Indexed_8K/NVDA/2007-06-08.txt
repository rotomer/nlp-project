SECTION 8 - Other Events
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
During fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Company worked with members of the Companys management and outside counsel to document and refine the Companys stock option grant practices. Once completed, the written stock option grant procedures (the Procedures) were presented to the Audit Committee for its review and approval. The Procedures were then reviewed and approved by the full Board on September 12, 2006. The Procedures are designed to enhance the Companys existing stock option grant process by providing additional approval processes for stock option awards, further delineating/clarifying specific responsibilities for relevant Company personnel, and providing for multiple layers of review. The Committee has reviewed and revised the Procedures as needed since their adoption. The Company has used the Procedures for all option grants since their adoption.
