SECTION 8  Other Events
Item 8.01. Other Events.
As we have previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 29, 2007, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of $1.7 billion. During our third fiscal quarter fiscal 2008, as part of this program, we intend to purchase a minimum of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock on the open market, in negotiated transactions or through structured stock repurchase agreements. Our stock repurchase plan is designed, among other things, to offset dilution from stock issuances pursuant to our employee benefit plans.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
