On September 18, 2008, NVIDIA Corporation announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas. As a result, NVIDIA expects to eliminate approximately 360 positions worldwide, or about 6.5 percent of our global workforce. The reduction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending October 26, 2008. We expect to record restructuring-related charges of approximately $7 million to $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the reduction. These pre-tax charges are comprised of severance and related expenses and are expected to be charged primarily against our operating expenses.
 
In connection with, and contingent upon, the corporate workforce reduction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a proposal by management to reduce to zero any individual variable cash payments that would be payable to our executive officers pursuant to the NVIDIA Corporation Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan. Fiscal 2009 ends January 25, 2009. The Fiscal Year 2009 Variable Compensation Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2008.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
