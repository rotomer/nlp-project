Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan
On May 5, 2010, the Compensation Committee, or the Compensation Committee, of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA Corporation approved the Fiscal Year 2011 Variable Compensation Plan, or the 2011 Plan, which is designed to provide variable cash compensation to certain officers, directors, managers and qualifying senior contributors, or the Participants, as determined by our Compensation Committee, if certain pre-set corporate and/or individual targets are achieved during fiscal 2011. We operate on a 52 or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. We designate our fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends; e.g., fiscal 2011 refers to our fiscal year ending January 30, 2011.
On September 7, 2010, the Compensation Committee amended the 2011 Plan in order to maintain Participant focus on corporate financial performance and to create incentives for the second half of fiscal 2011.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, variable cash compensation will be paid to the Participants resulting from our achievement of certain pre-set net income levels, determined according to United States generally accepted accounting principles, for the second half of fiscal 2011 as set by our Compensation Committee.  Variable cash compensation will also be paid if individuals achieve their individual targets which are determined by our Compensation Committee for the chief executive officer, by the chief executive officer in the case of the senior officers, by the senior officer to whom a vice president or a director reports in the case of vice presidents and directors, and based on individual rankings for managers and other qualifying senior contributors.
In addition, in connection with our previously scheduled mid-year compensation review, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in the target variable compensation level that certain executive officers and employees may receive. 
  Originally, 50% of a Participants potential variable cash compensation was to be allocated to the achievement of corporate targets for all of fiscal 2011 (up to a maximum of 200% of the Participants corporate target award) and 50% was to be allocated to the achievement of individual targets.  As amended, 25% of a Participants potential variable cash compensation will be allocated to the achievement of revised corporate targets for only the second half of fiscal 2011, or the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount, (up to a maximum of 120% of the  Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount ) and 50% will still be allocated to the achievement of individual targets for the full fiscal year.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, the ability to achieve the Revised Corporate Pe rformance Target Amount  was reduced by one half (to 25% of the target) to reflect the elimination of corporate targets for the first half of fiscal 2011 from the 2011 Plan.
Originally, we needed to achieve a threshold level of net income before Participants would be eligible to receive that portion of variable compensation allocable to the achievement of the corporate target.  Under the 2011 Plan, as amended, a Participant is eligible to receive payout of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount on a straight line basis if we achieve net income between $0 and the pre-set target net income amount, or the Target Net Income Amount.   In addition, under the 2011 Plan, as amended, a Participant is eligible to receive payout of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount on a straight line basis if we achieve net income between the Target Net Income Amount and a pre-set maximum amount (up to a maximum of 120% of the Revised Corporate Performance Target Amount). Previously, t he payout for achieving the pre-determined maximum amount was set at 200%.
Form of Non Statutory and Incentive Stock Options
On September 7, 2010, the Compensation Committee approved new forms of non statutory and incentive stock options under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan which provide for a 10-year contractual term as permitted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.   Previously, non-statutory and incentive stock options under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan provided for a 6-year contractual term.  The form non-statutory and incentive stock options are filed with this report as Exhibit 10.20 and 10.21, respectively and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by Exhibits 10.20 and 10.21.

The details of your Option are as follows:
 
  The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option is set forth in the Certificate.  This Option is intended to qualify and will be treated as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code) to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, and any portion not qualifying as an incentive stock option shall be treated as a non-statutory stock option.
1.
 
  The exercise price of this Option is set forth on the Certificate and is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of this Option.

(c)
  To the extent that this Option is otherwise intended to be treated as an incentive stock option, note that to obtain the federal income tax advantages associated with an incentive stock option, the Code requires that at all times beginning on the date of grant of your Option and ending on the date that is three (3) months before the date of your Options exercise, you must be an employee of the Company or an affiliate, except in the event of your death or Disability.  To the extent that the Company has provided for extended exercisability of your Option under certain circumstances for your benefit, the Company cannot guarantee that your Option will necessarily be treated as an incentive stock option if you continue to provide services to the Co mpany or an affiliate after your employment terminates or if you otherwise exercise your Option more than three (3) months after the date your employment with the Company or an affiliate terminates.
