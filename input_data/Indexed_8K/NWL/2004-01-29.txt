(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) DELAWARE 1-9608 36-3514169 -------- ------ ---------- (State or Other Jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of Incorporation) File Number) Identification No.) Deerfield Corporate Centre One 13010 Morris Road, Suite 100 Alpharetta, Georgia 30004 ------------------------------ ----- (Address of Principal Executive Offices) (Zip Code) Registrant's telephone number, including area code: (770) 670-2232 ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (c) Exhibits. Exhibit Number Description ------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release, dated January 29, 2004, issued by Newell Rubbermaid Inc., and Additional Financial Information ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K. On January 29, 2004, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. The Company's press release, dated January 29, 2004, is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of SEC Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (For certain other statistical measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided other supplemental information, also as part of the press release.) The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal 2 evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures -- including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures" -- and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view the Company's performance using the same tools that Company management uses and to gauge the Company's progress in achieving its stated goals. The Company's management believes that the individual measures are also useful to investors for more specific reasons: Operating income, net income and gross margin, excluding restructuring and other charges, as a percentage of sales. -- These measures are also useful to investors because they provide information with respect to operating income, net income and gross margin related to continuing operations after the restructuring plan is completed. Free cash flow: Cash flow provided by operations, net of dividends and capital expenditures. -- This measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. Diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges. -- This measure is also useful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share, both historical and expected, related to continuing operations after the restructuring plan is completed. The other purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and earnings per share, excluding restructuring and other charges, is as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. 3 SIGNATURES ---------- Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ [NEWELL RUBBERMAID LOGO] NEWS RELEASE ------------ JANUARY 29, 2004 Page 1 of 5 NEWELL RUBBERMAID REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2003 RESULTS * Delivered Strong Free Cash Flow and Inventory Improvement * Internal Sales Grow 2.3% in the Fourth Quarter * Continued Progress on Divestitures ATLANTA, JANUARY 29, 2004 - Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2003 results, delivering net sales, earnings and free cash flow at the high-end of its fourth quarter estimates. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Net loss in the quarter was $211.6 million, or a loss of $0.77 per share in 2003, compared to net income of $95.8 million, or $0.36 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net income, excluding charges in the fourth quarter, was $110.8 million versus $132.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, was $0.40 compared to $0.49 in the fourth quarter 2002. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release. Free cash flow was a record $242.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $176.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. This strong performance was largely driven by improvement in working capital management, as the company eliminated $205 million or 19 days of inventory from the level at September 30, 2003. The company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends. "Last year was challenging for Newell Rubbermaid, however, our team made progress in the transformation of this company, as we continued the execution of our restructuring plan. We are moving quickly to reconfigure our portfolio, exiting low-margin product lines and pursuing the divestiture of non-strategic businesses. When we exit 2004, we believe this company will be a much leaner organization that is ready to maximize shareholder value" said Joseph Galli, Newell Rubbermaid CEO. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $2.1 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of 3.9%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit to sales of 3.7% during the quarter, while pricing declined 1.8%. [NEWELL RUBBERMAID LOGO] NEWS RELEASE ------------ JANUARY 29, 2004 Page 2 of 5 Internal sales growth, which excludes the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures, increased 2.3% for the quarter. News from the groups include: * Irwin - Strong sales growth was seen in the Irwin hand tools and power tool accessories businesses. The launch of the Strait-line{R} laser products was extremely successful and was a key driver of the fourth quarter sales performance in the hand tools division. * Rubbermaid - Rubbermaid Home Organization delivered strong internal sales growth during the quarter. The division was able to sell higher than expected levels of existing stock of discontinued product lines in December. This was part of the company's previously announced plan to exit certain low-margin product lines. * Sharpie - Despite the continued sales weakness in the commercial writing business, the Sharpie group was able to offset those declines through its retail channels. * Calphalon Home - In the Calphalon Home group, the on-going sales declines seen in the picture frames and low-end cookware businesses, continued in the fourth quarter. In high-end cookware, Calphalon{R} One {TM} Infused Anodized cookware was successfully launched during this quarter. Gross margins decreased to 25.4% from 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2002, due primarily to unfavorable pricing and the absorption impact from lower manufacturing volumes, offset partially by productivity. Excluding charges, gross margins declined to 25.7% from 28.4%. As part of its previously announced restructuring plan, the company recorded a fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $79.0 million primarily related to severance and facility exit costs in connection with the company's streamlining and productivity initiatives, and other charges of $18.8 million primarily related to product line exits and the sale of a business. The company made significant progress in the fourth quarter related to its strategy to divest certain under performing non-strategic assets. The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $289.4 million, in the fourth quarter of 2003, related to non-core businesses targeted for sale. These businesses contributed approximately $875 million in sales in 2003. The sale of these businesses could have an adverse impact on pre-tax earnings of $44 - $52 million ($0.11 - $0.13) and on cash flow for the year. The company expects to provide earnings and cash flow impact related to a particular business, if and when, the potential sales occur. FULL YEAR RESULTS Net sales for the full year 2003 were $7.8 billion compared to $7.5 billion in 2002, an increase of 4.0%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit to sales of 3.1% for the year, while pricing declined 1.9%. Internal sales were flat for the full year 2003. [NEWELL RUBBERMAID LOGO] NEWS RELEASE ------------ JANUARY 29, 2004 Page 3 of 5 Gross margins for the full year decreased to 26.7% from 27.6% in 2002, due primarily to unfavorable pricing and the absorption impact from lower manufacturing volumes, offset partially by productivity. Excluding charges, gross margins declined to 26.9% from 27.8%. Net loss for the full year 2003 was $46.6 million, or $0.17 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $203.4 million, or $0.76 loss per share in 2002. Excluding charges, net income for 2003 was $408.0 million versus $423.2 million for 2002. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, were $1.49 versus $1.58 for 2002. In addition, for the full year 2003, as part of its previously announced restructuring plan, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $245.0 million primarily related to severance and facility exit costs in connection with the company's streamlining and productivity initiatives, and other charges of $48.7 million, related primarily product line exit costs and loss on the sale of businesses. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release. PENSION LIABILITIES As previously disclosed, the company recorded a non-cash charge to shareholders equity of $114.5 million in the fourth quarter to record the minimum pension liability related to the under-funded status of the pension plan. This charge did not impact earnings or cash flow in 2003. OUTLOOK For 2004, the company expects its full year 2004 internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.58. This range excludes restructuring charges of $43 - $63 million ($0.11 - $0.16 per share) and other charges of $10 - $20 million ($0.03 - $0.05 per share) primarily related to product line exits and charges of $70 - $90 million ($0.25 - $0.33 per share) primarily for foreign currency translation adjustments related to the divestiture of non-core businesses targeted for sale. This guidance does not include the impact of any potential divestitures. For the first quarter 2004, the company expects internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 - $0.20. This range excludes restructuring charges of $25 - $35 million ($0.06 - $0.09 per share) and other charges of $5 - $10 million ($0.01 - $0.03 per share) primarily related to product line exits and charges of $70 - $90 million ($0.25 - $0.33 per share) primarily for foreign currency translation adjustments related to the divestiture of non-core business targeted for sale. This guidance does not include the impact of any potenial divestitures.
