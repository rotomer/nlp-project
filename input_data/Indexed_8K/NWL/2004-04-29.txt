UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 -------------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): April 29, 2004 NEWELL RUBBERMAID INC. (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter) Delaware 1-9608 36-3514169 (State or Other (Commission (IRS Employer Jurisdiction File Number) Identification No.) of Incorporation) 10 B Glenlake Parkway Suite 600 Atlanta, Georgia 30328 (Address of Principal Executive (Zip Code) Offices) Registrant's Telephone Number, Including Area Code:(770) 407-3800 Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. Exhibit Number Description ------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release, dated April 29, 2004, issued by Newell Rubbermaid Inc., and Additional Financial Information Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K. On April 29, 2004, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004. The Company's press release, dated April 29, 2004, is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures -- including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures" -- and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures: * enable investors and analysts to compare the current non-GAAP measures with the corresponding non-GAAP measures used in the past, and * permit investors to view the Company's performance using the same tools that Company management uses to evaluate the Company's past performance, reportable business segments and prospects for future performance and to gauge the Company's progress in achieving its stated goals. The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring and other charges, as a percentage of sales are also useful to investors because they provide information with respect to operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin related to continuing operations after the Company's restructuring plan is completed. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of and capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share, both historical and expected, related to continuing operations after the Company's restructuring plan is completed. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ NEWELL RUBBERMAID NEWS RELEASE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- NEWELL RUBBERMAID REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2004 RESULTS Newell Rubbermaid Inc. Atlanta, GA Securities Listed NYSE Common Stock (Symbol: NWL) www.newellrubbermaid.com JESSE HERRON SUSAN MASTEN Vice President, Director, Investor Relations Public Relations 10B Glenlake Parkway, 10B Glenlake Parkway, Suite 600 Suite 600 Atlanta, GA 30328 Atlanta, GA 30328 Phone: 770-407-3994 Phone: 770-407-3817 Fax: 770-407-3983 Fax: 770-407-3983 * EARNINGS IN-LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS * DIVESTITURES REINFORCE FOCUS ON CORE PORTFOLIO ATLANTA, APRIL 29, 2004 - Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today announced its first quarter 2004 results in-line with expectations and previous guidance. The company has now substantially completed its previously announced plan to divest certain under-performing, non- strategic businesses in order to concentrate on leveraging brand strength and product innovation in its core portfolio of businesses. In the consolidated statements of operations, the results of these divested businesses are presented as discontinued operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS --------------------- Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $33.1 million or $0.12 per share in 2004, compared to net income from continuing operations of $39.9 million, or $0.15 per share in the first quarter of 2003. Net income from continuing operations, excluding charges in the first quarter 2004, was $51.5 million versus $73.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, calculated on the same basis, was $0.19 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter 2003. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release. "We are pleased to report we made significant progress this past quarter. Our 2004 priorities remain unchanged as we continue to work to recon- figure our portfolio, through divestitures and the exit of low-margin product lines and to complete our restructuring plan," said Joseph Galli, Newell Rubbermaid CEO. "During the quarter we completed the bulk of our divestiture plan and also exited approximately $60 million in sales of low-margin product lines. We are also on track to record the remaining charges related to our restructuring plan in the second quarter." While portfolio reconfiguration and restructuring will provide the foundation for the company's 2004 efforts, the company's focus on cost reductions through its implementation of Newell Operational Excellence (NWL OPEX) will provide a source for future profitability. Galli added, "NWL OPEX, our program for driving productivity throughout our manu- facturing network, is gaining traction. We are still in the early stages of harvesting the benefits of lean manufacturing, but our teams remain focused on consistent metrics while driving steady improvements. We delivered approximately 2.5% productivity savings during the quarter and we believe we are capable of much more going forward." Free cash flow was a use of $101.0 million in the first quarter, compared to a use of $110.4 million in the first quarter of 2003. The company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash from operating activities is attached to this release. Net sales in the first quarter of 2004 were $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2003, a decrease of 1.1%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit to sales of 3.6% during the quarter, primarily offset by pricing declines of 0.8% and the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 3.8%. Internal sales, which exclude the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures, declined 0.4% in the first quarter 2004. This was driven primarily by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines, particularly at Rubbermaid Home Products, and sales softness at Graco which were partially offset by strong performance in IRWIN Industrial Tools North America. Gross margins decreased to 26.7% from 27.8% in the first quarter of 2004, due primarily to unfavorable pricing and higher raw materials cost, offset partially by productivity. Excluding charges, gross margins declined to 27.0% from 28.0%. As part of its previously announced restructuring plan, the company recorded a first quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $22.8 million primarily related to severance and facility exit costs in connection with the company's streamlining and productivity initiatives and other pre-tax charges of $4.1 million primarily related to product line exits. The company also recorded a net loss of $108.0 million related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, shown as discontinued operations. OUTLOOK ------- For 2004, the company continues to expect internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.46. This range excludes restructuring charges of $43 - $63 million ($0.11 - $0.16 per share) and other charges of $10 - $20 million ($0.03 - $0.05 per share) primarily related to product line exits. Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations is expected to be a net loss $108 - $113 million ($0.39 - $0.40 per share) related to divestitures of non-core businesses. For the second quarter 2004, the company expects internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing opera- tions to be $0.34 - $0.38. This range excludes restructuring charges of $20 - $40 million ($0.05 - $0.10 per share) and other charges of $6 - $11 million ($0.02 - $0.03 per share) primarily related to product line exits and charges of $0 - 5 million ($0.00 - $0.01 per share) for potential losses related to divestitures of non-core businesses.
