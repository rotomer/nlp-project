Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On July 29, 2004, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004. The Company's press release, dated July 29, 2004, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring and other charges, and as a percentage of sales, are also useful to investors because they provide information with respect to operating income, net income from continuing
 
operations and gross margin related to continuing operations after the Company's restructuring plan is completed. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share, both historical and expected, related to continuing operations after the Company's restructuring plan is completed. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today announced its second quarter 2004 results delivering earnings within expectations and generating strong free cash flow.
ATLANTA, July 29, 2004
Second Quarter Results
Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $57.6 million, or $0.21 per share in 2004, compared to net income from continuing operations of $82.0 million, or $0.30 per share in the second quarter 2003. Net income from continuing operations, excluding charges in the second quarter 2004, was $103.8 million versus $118.4 million in the second quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, calculated on the same basis, was $0.38 per share compared to $0.43 per share in the second quarter 2003. The second quarter 2004 results include a tax-related benefit of $6.4 million or $0.02 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the second quarter 2004 were $1.74 billion, compared to $1.80 billion in the second quarter 2003, a decrease of 3.3%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit to sales of 1.6% during the quarter, primarily offset by pricing declines of 0.8% and the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 3.6%. Sales declines in the quarter were driven primarily by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines, particularly at Rubbermaid Home Products, and sales softness in the Office Products segment that was concentrated in the everyday writing category. These were partially offset by strong performances in the LENOX and Little Tikes divisions.
"We are pleased to have delivered on our commitments in a challenging second quarter," said Newell Rubbermaid CEO Joe Galli. "Our results this quarter demonstrate areas of continued progress with the completion of charges relating to our restructuring plan and our strong improvement in free cash flow. While we certainly have challenges ahead of us this year including a tough raw material environment, we remain committed to our strategy and will continue to make significant strategic SG&A investments into our businesses."
Free cash flow improved $104.0 million to $52.2 million in the second quarter, compared to a use of $51.8 million in the second quarter 2003. This improvement was driven primarily by reduced capital spending in certain divisions. The company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends. A reconciliation

of free cash flow to net cash from operating activities is attached to this release.
Gross margins decreased to 28.0% in the second quarter 2004 from 29.2% in the second quarter 2003, due primarily to higher raw materials costs and unfavorable pricing, offset partially by productivity. Excluding charges, gross margins declined to 28.7% in the second quarter 2004 from 29.3% in the second quarter 2003.
As part of its previously announced restructuring plan, the company recorded a second quarter pre-tax restructuring charge of $25.1 million, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs, in connection with the company's streamlining and productivity initiatives, and other pre-tax charges of $13.3 million, primarily related to product line exits. The company also recorded an impairment charge of $25.1 million, primarily related to asset impairment in the Cleaning & Organization and Home Fashions segments. Related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, the company also recorded net income of $3.4 million, shown as discontinued operations.
Galli added, "With the second quarter behind us, we have now completed the charge phase of the three-year restructuring plan we outlined in May 2001. This is a milestone for the company and represents tremendous efforts by our team. While there will continue to be work to do in the back half of the year, we are a much leaner organization, focused on improving our businesses."
Six Month Results
Net sales for the first six months of 2004 were $3.27 billion, a decrease of 2.2% from $3.34 billion for the first six months of 2003. Internal sales, which excludes the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures made in the past year, declined 1.9%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by 2.5% for the first six months, primarily offset by pricing declines of 0.8% and the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 3.6%.
Net income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2004 was $91.8 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to $123.3 million, or $0.45 per share in 2003. Excluding charges, net income for the first six months of 2004 was $156.4 million versus $193.5 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, were $0.57 in the first six months of 2004 versus $0.71 in 2003.
In the first six months of 2004, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $47.9 million and other pre-tax charges of $17.5 million, primarily related to product line exits. The company also recorded an impairment charge of $25.1 million, primarily related to asset impairment in the Cleaning & Organization and Home Fashions segments. Related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, the company also recorded a net loss of $105.6 million, shown as discontinued operations.

Outlook
For 2004, the company continues to expect internal sales to decline 1%  3% and expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to now be in the range of $1.36 to $1.41. This range excludes restructuring charges of $47.9 million ($0.12 per share) and other charges of $17.5 million ($0.04 per share), primarily related to product line exits, and charges of $25.1 million ($0.07 per share) related to asset impairment. Discontinued operations related to the divestiture of non-core businesses was a net loss of $105.6 million ($0.39 per share) as of the second quarter and will be offset by a gain of $10-$15 million ($0.02-$0.04 per share).
For the third quarter 2004, the company expects internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.32 - $0.36. This range reflects the company's planned investment of SG&A in its businesses. The range also excludes a gain of $10-$15 million ($0.02-$0.04 per share) related to the divestiture of non-core businesses.
A reconciliation of the 2004 earnings outlook is as follows:
The company now expects free cash flow for the full year to be $250 to $275 million, at the high-end of its previous guidance, calculated as follows: cash flow from operations (estimated to be $680-$705 million), less capital expenditures (estimated to be approximately $200 million), less expected dividends of approximately $230 million.
