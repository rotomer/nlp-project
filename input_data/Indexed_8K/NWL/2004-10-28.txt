Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 28, 2004, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Company's press release, dated October 28, 2004, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, and as a percentage of sales, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share, both historical and expected, related to the Company's continuing operations. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses

for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today announced its results for the third quarter 2004, generating strong free cash flow and delivering results at the high-end of guidance, exceeding Wall Street consensus.
ATLANTA, October 28, 2004
Third Quarter Results
Net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter 2004 was $235.0 million, or $0.86 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $85.5 million, or $0.31 per share, in the third quarter 2003. During the third quarter this year, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $348.9 million ($332.8 million after-tax). Net income from continuing operations, excluding the impairment charge, was $97.8 million in the third quarter 2004, compared to net income from continuing operations, excluding charges, of $108.2 million in the third quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, calculated on the same basis, was $0.36 per share in the third quarter 2004, compared to Wall Street consensus of $0.33 per share and $0.39 per share earned in the third quarter 2003. The third quarter 2004 results include a tax benefit of $2.9 million ($0.01 per share). A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the third quarter 2004 were $1.67 billion, compared to $1.73 billion in the third quarter 2003, a decrease of 3.3%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit to sales of 1.7% and pricing was a favorable 0.2%. These were offset by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 4.3%, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products division.
Free cash flow was $202.2 million in the third quarter 2004, a $39.7 million improvement over $162.5 million in the third quarter 2003. This improvement was driven by reduced capital spending, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products division, offset by a voluntary $50.0 million cash contribution to fund the company's pension plan. The company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash from operating activities is attached to this release.
"Our team delivered yet another quarter of strong free cash flow. We have demonstrated improved capital spending discipline throughout 2004 while we continue to strategically support the high-potential businesses in our portfolio," said Newell Rubbermaid CEO Joe Galli. "We're on track for another year of outstanding free cash flow performance."
Gross margin declined to 28.3% in the third quarter 2004 from 28.4% in the third quarter 2003, driven primarily by higher raw materials costs, partially offset by favorable pricing and productivity savings. Excluding charges, gross margin was 28.3% in the third quarter 2004, down from 28.5% in the third quarter 2003.

"During the third quarter we saw record-high costs for several of our raw materials. The team did a good job offsetting this inflation through a combination of productivity and pricing initiatives," said Galli. "As we look to the balance of 2004 and beyond, we are anticipating significant pressure in the commodity environment. We are committed to continue offsetting commodity inflation through cost reductions in our manufacturing network and price increases."
In conjunction with the company's annual test of impairment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter and its testing of other long-lived assets for impairment, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $348.9 million ($332.8 million after-tax) in the third quarter 2004. The impairment is primarily related to European and Latin American businesses within the Office Products segment and the European business in the Cleaning & Organization segment. Additional information regarding this impairment charge is provided in the company's Form 8-K filed October 28, 2004.
During the quarter the company recorded an after-tax gain of $8.6 million, shown as discontinued operations, primarily related to the previously announced sale of its Little Tikes Commercial Play Systems business.
Nine-Month Results
Net sales for the first nine months of 2004 were $4.94 billion, a decrease of 2.6% from $5.07 billion for the first nine months of 2003. Internal sales, which excludes the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures made in the past year, declined 2.4%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by 2.3%, primarily offset by pricing declines of 0.5% and the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 3.9%.
Net loss from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $143.3 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to net income of $208.9 million, or $0.76 per share in 2003. Excluding charges, net income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $254.1 million versus $301.8 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, were $0.93 in the first nine months of 2004 versus $1.10 in 2003.
Free cash flow was $153.4 million for the first nine months of 2004, a $153.1 million improvement over $0.3 million for the first nine months of 2003. This improvement was driven by reduced capital spending, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products division.
In the first nine months of 2004, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $47.9 million and other pre-tax charges of $17.5 million, primarily related to product line exits. The company also recorded impairment charges of $374.0 million, primarily related to asset impairment in the European and Latin American businesses within the Office Products segment and the European business in the Cleaning & Organization segment. Related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, the company also recorded a net loss of $97.0 million, shown as discontinued operations.

Outlook
For 2004, the company continues to expect internal sales to decline 1%  3% and continues to expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.41. This range excludes restructuring charges of $47.9 million ($0.12 per share), other charges of $17.5 million ($0.04 per share), primarily related to product line exits, charges of $374.0 million ($1.28 per share) related to asset impairment and a net loss on discontinued operations related to the divestiture of non-core businesses of $97.0 million ($0.35 per share).
For the fourth quarter 2004, the company expects internal sales to decline 1%  3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47.
A reconciliation of the 2004 earnings outlook is as follows:
The company now expects free cash flow for the full year to be in the range of $275 to $300 million, calculated as follows: cash flow from operations (estimated to be $640-$665 million), less capital expenditures (estimated to be approximately $135 million), less dividends (estimated to be approximately $230 million).
