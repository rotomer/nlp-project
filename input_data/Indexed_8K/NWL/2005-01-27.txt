Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On January 27, 2005, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Company's press release, dated January 27, 2005, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, and as a percentage of sales, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share related to the Company's continuing operations. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management
 
employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
     Item 9.01      Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c)           Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
      
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2004, generating earnings growth and gross margin expansion during the quarter and delivering full year results at the high end of expectations.
ATLANTA, January 27, 2005
"Our team had a great year in 2004. We delivered our earnings commitments, generated strong cash flow, completed our previously announced divestiture and restructuring plans, improved capital spending discipline and enhanced our portfolio," said Newell Rubbermaid CEO Joe Galli. "We have momentum moving into 2005. We are focused on further strengthening our portfolio and investing in new product development and brand building initiatives to position our company for long-term success."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2004 was $124.1 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in the fourth quarter 2003. Net income from continuing operations, excluding charges, in the fourth quarter 2004 was $127.0 million, or $0.46 per share, compared to $104.2 million, or $0.38 per share, in the fourth quarter 2003. The fourth quarter 2004 results include a tax benefit of $6.2 million, or $0.02 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the fourth quarter 2004 were $1.81 billion, compared to $1.83 billion in the fourth quarter 2003, a decrease of 1.0%. Net sales reflected a foreign currency benefit of 2.5% and a positive pricing impact of 1.1%. These were offset by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 4.1%, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products division.
Gross margin increased to 28.8% in the fourth quarter 2004 from 26.8% in the fourth quarter 2003, a 200 basis point improvement. Excluding charges, gross margin was 28.8% in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to 27.2% in the fourth quarter 2003, a 160 basis point improvement, driven primarily by productivity savings, favorable pricing and improved product mix, partially offset by raw material inflation.
"Our team worked hard and responded to the pressures in the raw material environment, delivering gross margin expansion through a combination of productivity and pricing," said Galli. "As we look to 2005, we see raw material challenges continuing. We will work to offset inflation through continued productivity initiatives and taking price increases in the marketplace."

Free cash flow was $153.7 million in the fourth quarter 2004, compared to $242.1 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The company defines free cash flow as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash from operating activities is attached to this release.
Full Year Results
Net sales for the full year 2004 were $6.75 billion, a decrease of 2.2% from $6.90 billion for the full year 2003. Internal sales, which excludes the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures made in the past year, declined 2.0%. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by 2.3% and was offset by pricing declines of 0.1% and the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 4.0%.
Net loss from continuing operations for the full year 2004 was $19.1 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $213.2 million, or $0.78 per share in 2003. Excluding charges, net income from continuing operations for the full year 2004 was $381.1 million versus $406.0 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, were $1.39 in the full year 2004 versus $1.48 in 2003.
Free cash flow was $307.1 million for the full year 2004, a $64.8 million improvement over $242.3 million for the full year 2003. This improvement was driven by reduced capital spending, primarily in the Rubbermaid Home Products division, as the company continues to reduce its manufacturing overhead.
In the full year 2004, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $52.1 million and other pre-tax charges of $17.4 million, primarily related to product line exits. The company also recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $374.0 million, primarily related to asset impairment in the European and Latin American businesses within the Office Products segment and the European business in the Cleaning & Organization segment. The company also recorded a net loss of $97.0 million, shown as discontinued operations, related to the divestitures of non-core businesses.
"This year we have also strengthened our team at the management and board levels with the additions of Group President Office Products Steve Marton and new board members Michael Cowhig and Mark Ketchum," said Galli. "These proven leaders bring consumer products experience, operational expertise and global leadership to our team."
Stock Option Accounting
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a pronouncement requiring companies to expense employee stock options based on their fair value beginning July 1, 2005. The company is currently evaluating the financial impact of this pronouncement.

Outlook
For the full year 2005, the company expects internal sales growth to be in the range of (1%) to 1%. This range reflects the company's strategic decision to exit approximately $200 million of low-margin product lines. The company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2005 to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48. This range does not include any impact from the accounting pronouncement related to the expensing of stock options. This range also does not include a non-cash loss expected to be in the range of $75 to $95 million related to the company's previously announced agreement for the intended sale of its European Curver business, which will be reported as discontinued operations.
The company expects 2005 net cash from operating activities to be in the range of $625 to $675 million. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment are expected to be in the range of $125 to $150 million and dividends are expected to be approximately $230 million for the full year 2005.
For the first quarter 2005, the company expects internal sales to decline 1% - 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.28.
