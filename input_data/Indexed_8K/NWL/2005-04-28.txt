Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On April 28, 2005, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005. The Company's press release, dated April 28, 2005, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring and other charges, and as a percentage of sales, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share related to the Company's continuing operations. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help

determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
     While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

 Reflecting improved pricing discipline and productivity, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported net income from continuing operations of $86.9 million, or $0.32 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005, compared to $33.6 million, or $0.12 per share, reported for the first quarter 2004. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter 2005 included a tax benefit of $58.6 million, or $0.21 per share, offset by planned restructuring and related charges of $23.5 million, or $0.06 per share. Excluding charges primarily related to the company's previously announced restructuring program, net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2004 was $50.7 million, or $0.18 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
ATLANTA, April 28, 2005
Joe Galli, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid, said, "Our continued success this quarter in maintaining pricing discipline and achieving productivity gains enabled us to manage through record raw-material inflation to deliver on our earnings commitment."
Net sales in the first quarter 2005 were $1.39 billion, compared to $1.49 billion in the first quarter 2004, a decrease of 6.5%. Net sales reflected a favorable pricing impact of 2.0% and a foreign currency benefit of 1.6%. These were offset by a core sales decline of 6.1%, primarily driven by the negative volume impact of price increases in Rubbermaid Home Products, and an additional 4.0% resulting from the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines.
"We remain committed to taking the necessary steps to counteract the anticipated continued high prices for raw materials," said Galli. "As we look ahead, we will continue to make strategic investments in our high-margin, high-potential businesses to support our long-term growth initiatives fueled by new products, like our new Sharpie Mini, a miniature version of the classic Sharpiefine point permanent marker which launches with an integrated national marketing campaign early May."
Gross margin increased to 27.2% in the first quarter 2005 from 27.1% in the first quarter 2004. Excluding charges, gross margin was 27.4% in the first quarter 2004. The company's favorable pricing and productivity savings significantly offset raw material inflation of approximately $51 million.
Net cash from operating activities rose $62.2 million in the first quarter 2005 to $55.5 million driven by increased earnings and improved working capital management, compared to a use of $6.7 million in the first quarter 2004. Capital expenditures in the first quarter 2005 were $23.1 million compared to $36.6 million in the first quarter 2004, reflecting the company's on-going

efforts to reduce manufacturing overhead. The company continued to pay a strong dividend in the quarter of $58.0 million, or $0.21 per share.
During the first quarter 2005, the company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $50.3 million related to the company's previously announced agreement for the intended sale of its European Curver business.
Outlook
The company continues to expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2005 to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48. Driven by the company's strategic decision to exit $200 million in annual revenue of low-margin product lines and the volume impact related to its pricing strategy, the company now expects internal sales to decline in the range of 1% to 3% for the full year 2005. This outlook does not include total non-cash and operating losses now expected to be in the range of $60 to $80 million for the full year, which includes the $50.3 million net loss recorded in the first quarter, related to the company's previously announced agreement for the intended sale of its European Curver business, which will be reported as discontinued operations.
The company continues to expect 2005 net cash from operating activities to be in the range of $625 to $675 million. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment are expected to be in the range of $125 to $150 million and dividends are expected to be approximately $230 million for the full year 2005.
For the second quarter 2005, the company expects internal sales to decline in the range of 1% to 3% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.32.
