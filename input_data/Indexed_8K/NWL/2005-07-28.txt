Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On July 28, 2005, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005. The Company's press release, dated July 28, 2005, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring and other charges, and as a percentage of sales, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information with respect to earnings per share related to the Company's continuing operations. Another purpose for which the Company uses free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in

the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported its second quarter results delivering earnings above expectations and generating 170 basis points of gross margin expansion, reflecting continued productivity driven by Newell Operational Excellence and pricing discipline.
ATLANTA, July 28, 2005
Second Quarter Results
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $103.5 million, or $0.38 per share, which includes planned restructuring and related charges of approximately $12 million, or $0.03 per share. The timing of approximately $0.02 per share of additional restructuring and related charges planned for the second quarter will now occur throughout the balance of the year. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $58.5 million, or $0.21 per share. Excluding restructuring and related charges and asset impairment, net income from continuing operations for the second quarter 2004 was $104.9 million, or $0.38 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the second quarter 2005 were $1.64 billion, compared to $1.67 billion in the second quarter 2004, a decrease of 1.6%, in line with company expectations. Net sales reflected a positive pricing impact of 2.1% and a foreign currency benefit of 1.5%. These were offset by a core sales decline of 1.6%, primarily driven by the negative volume impact of price increases in Rubbermaid Home Products, and an additional 3.6% resulting from the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines.
Joseph Galli, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid, said, "We are pleased with our solid results this quarter as we continue to transform Newell Rubbermaid. Investment behind high-margin, high-potential businesses is a priority for the company and we are seeing traction with our "Invest/Grow" platforms collectively generating three percent top-line growth during the quarter."
In the second quarter 2005 gross margin improved to 31.0%, a 240 basis point improvement from second quarter 2004 gross margin of 28.6% and a 170 basis point improvement from second quarter 2004 gross margin, excluding charges, of 29.3%. The company's productivity savings and favorable pricing offset raw material inflation of approximately $37 million.

Mr. Galli added, "The team delivered an impressive performance given the sustained high raw material inflation. We were able to overcome this challenging environment through continued productivity savings generated through our Newell Operational Excellence initiative and pricing discipline. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing throughout the company and we remain committed to further reducing our manufacturing overhead and taking the necessary actions to achieve a best cost position. We believe this offers tremendous opportunity for further margin expansion."
Consistent with company expectations, net cash from operating activities was $36.4 million in the second quarter 2005, compared to $143.7 million in the second quarter 2004. Capital expenditures in the second quarter 2005 were $22.9 million compared to $33.5 million in the second quarter 2004, reflecting the company's continued decapitalization and efforts to reduce manufacturing overhead. The company continued to pay a strong dividend in the quarter of $57.8 million, or $0.21 per share.
The company continues to make progress on its strategy to divest non-strategic businesses and concentrate on leveraging brand strength and product innovation in its core portfolio of businesses. During the second quarter 2005, the company completed the sale of its European Curver business and recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $15.1 million related to this transaction. In addition, the company began marketing a non-core business in its Cleaning & Organization segment. The company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of $22.2 million, primarily to state the assets of this business at their estimated fair value. This business had net sales of approximately $75 million in 2004 and has been reported as discontinued operations.
Six Month Results
Net sales for the first six months of 2005 were $3.02 billion, a decrease of 3.8% from $3.14 billion for the first six months of 2004. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by 1.6% for the first six months, while pricing increased 2.0%. These were offset by a core sales decline of 3.6%, primarily driven by the negative volume impact of price increases in Rubbermaid Home Products, and an additional 3.8% resulting from the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines.
Net income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2005 was $188.3 million, or $0.69 per share, which includes a tax benefit of $58.6 million or $0.21 per share offset by planned restructuring and related charges of $35.5 million or $0.09 per share. Net income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2004 was $90.6 million, or $0.33 per share. Excluding restructuring and related charges and asset impairment, net income for the first six months of 2004 was $153.6 million or $0.56 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net cash from operating activities was $91.9 million for the first six months of 2005, compared to $137.0 million for the first six months of 2004. Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2005 were $46.0 million compared to $70.1 million for the first six months of 2004,

reflecting the company's continued decapitalization and efforts to reduce manufacturing overhead. Dividends were $115.8 million for the first six months of 2005.
Related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, the company recorded a net loss of $85.5 million, shown as discontinued operations during the first six months of 2005.
Outlook
The company has refined its guidance to the high-end of its previous range and now expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2005 to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.48. The company continues to expect internal sales to decline in the range of 1% to 3% for the full year 2005, reflecting the company's strategic decision to exit $200 million in annual revenue of low-margin product lines and the volume impact related to its pricing strategy. This outlook does not include total net losses reported as discontinued operations, now expected to be approximately $90 million, which includes the $85.5 million recorded in the first six months of 2005 for the divestitures of non-core businesses.
The company continues to expect 2005 net cash from operating activities to be in the range of $625 to $675 million. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment are expected to be in the range of $125 to $150 million and dividends are expected to be approximately $230 million for the full year 2005.
For the third quarter 2005, the company expects internal sales to decline 0% to 2% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.37.
