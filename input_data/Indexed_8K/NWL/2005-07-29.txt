Joseph Galli, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid, said, "The combination of DYMO and our writing instruments and office products business represents a significant opportunity given the complementary nature of the product lines, distribution networks and geographies. This is an excellent example of our commitment to transform our portfolio into a focused group of leadership platforms through investment in high-quality brands with a proven track record of bringing innovative new products to the category."
Magnus Nicolin, chief executive officer of Esselte, said, "Over the last three years we have invested heavily in DYMO to substantially build the business. Today's announcement is a confirmation of our success in this effort."

Mr. Damiano said, "DYMO has an impressive track record of growth. The combined strengths of DYMO and Newell Rubbermaid in the consumer, office and industrial channels will allow us to build on this success."
Newell Rubbermaid's Office Products Group accounted for $1.7 billion of the company's $6.5 billion in sales in 2004. The group manufactures and markets writing instruments, art products and office organization supplies, led by a powerful brand family including Sharpie, Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman, EXPO, uni-ball, and Rolodex.
Esselte plans to use the proceeds of this transaction to substantially repay all of its current outstanding debt. In that connection, Esselte plans on the closing date to call for redemption its then outstanding 7.625% senior notes due in 2011, in accordance with Article III of the note indenture.
Esselte will focus its energies on supporting its global filing and organization business which consists of Pendaflex and Oxford in the U.S. and Esselte and Leitz throughout the rest of the world. Additionally, it is expected that Esselte will devote increasingly more resources to building its creative division which is made up of the Xyron craft and hobby business. The crafting industry has been rapidly growing for the past four years. Esselte sees this business as its next growth engine.
