Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 27, 2005, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005. The Company's press release, dated October 27, 2005, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges (and as a percentage of sales), and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses or has used free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
 
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
     Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
- Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported its third quarter 2005 results which were above expectations and included strong gross margin improvement.
ATLANTA, October 27, 2005
Third Quarter Results
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, was $53.5 million, or $0.19 per share. Excluding impairment charges, income from continuing operations was $112.1 million, or $0.41 per share. These results include a tax benefit of $15.3 million, or $0.06 per share, offset by restructuring and related charges of approximately $25 million, or $0.06 per share. Approximately $0.02 per share of restructuring and related charges planned for the third quarter were not incurred. Loss from continuing operations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, was $155.7 million, or $0.57 per share. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, income from continuing operations for the third quarter 2004 was $98.6 million, or $0.36 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the third quarter 2005 were $1.60 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in the third quarter 2004, a decrease of 1.4%. Net sales reflected a positive pricing impact of 1.9% and a foreign currency benefit of 0.9%. These were offset by a core sales decline of 1.7%, primarily driven by continued weakness in the European Window Fashions and Little Tikes businesses as well as the negative volume impact of price increases in Rubbermaid Home Products, and an additional 2.5% resulting from the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines. The businesses the company includes in its "Invest" category generated a 3.7% improvement in sales versus last year.
"Since stepping in to lead the organization, I've seen first hand the solid foundation that is in place at Newell Rubbermaid. I am committed to continuing the strategic direction of the company around investing in our strategic brands, achieving a best cost position and strengthening our portfolio," said Mark Ketchum, interim chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "We plan to make investments in advertising and promotion and research and development around our high-potential, high-margin brands."
Ketchum added, "Developing best-in-class practices around product innovation, consumer understanding and competitive benchmarking will be key drivers for our business as we work to improve our financial performance for our shareholders. We will place greater emphasis on the execution side of the business fundamentals, and on identifying cost inefficiencies within selling, general and administrative expense."
Gross margin for the third quarter 2005 improved to 31.3%, a 260 basis point improvement from third quarter 2004 gross margin of 28.7%. The company's productivity savings and favorable pricing offset raw material inflation.

"We are facing increased costs around resin and other commodities, but believe the recent spike in resin costs is temporary due to supply shortages caused primarily by the hurricanes in the Gulf. We anticipate costs will remain at these higher levels into next year, but expect some relief as capacity continues to come back on-line," said Patrick Robinson, chief financial officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "We will continue to take appropriate actions around pricing and productivity to moderate a challenging commodities environment."
During the third quarter 2005, the company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $58.6 million. These charges were required to write down to fair value certain assets related to the United Kingdom Window Fashions business in the company's Home Fashions segment and the European Cookware business reported in the company's Other segment. Consistent with the company's intent to divest non-strategic businesses and concentrate on leveraging brand strength and product innovation in its core portfolio of businesses, the company announced on October 11, 2005, its intent to sell the European Cookware business. This business will be reported as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter 2005.
The company continues to classify a business, formerly reported in the Cleaning & Organization segment, as discontinued operations. During the third quarter 2005, the company recorded a gain of approximately $20 million related to this business as several line reviews with key retailers have increased the company's valuation of this business.
Exceeding company expectations, net cash from operating activities was $359.4 million in the third quarter 2005, compared to $284.8 million in the third quarter 2004. The approximate $75 million increase was primarily driven by a voluntary $50 million cash contribution to the company's pension plan in 2004, which was not repeated in 2005, as well as a reduction of inventory levels. Capital expenditures in the third quarter 2005 were $23.9 million compared to $25.0 million in the third quarter 2004. The company continued to pay a strong dividend in the quarter of $57.9 million, or $0.21 per share.
Nine Month Results
Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 was $241.8 million, or $0.88 per share. Excluding impairment charges, income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2005 was $300.4 million, or $1.09 per share. These results include a tax benefit of $73.9 million, or $0.27 per share offset by planned restructuring and related charges of approximately $61 million, or $0.15 per share. Loss from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $65.1 million, or $0.24 per share. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2004 was $252.2 million, or $0.92 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2005 were $4.62 billion, a decrease of 3.0% from $4.76 billion for the first nine months of 2004. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by 1.3% for the first nine months, while pricing increased 2.0%. These were offset by a core sales decline of 2.9%, primarily driven by the negative volume impact of price increases in Rubbermaid Home Products and the continued weakness in the European Window Fashions and Little Tikes businesses, and an additional 3.4% resulting from the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines.

Net cash from operating activities was $451.3 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $421.8 million for the first nine months of 2004. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2005 were $69.9 million compared to $95.2 million for the first nine months of 2004, reflecting the company's continued decapitalization and efforts to reduce manufacturing overhead. Dividends were $173.7 million for the first nine months of 2005.
Related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, the company recorded a net loss of $67.5 million, reported as discontinued operations during the first nine months of 2005.
Pension Outlook
The company estimates that it will record a fourth quarter non-cash charge to shareholders' equity in the range of $40 to $60 million to record the under-funded status of the pension plan. This charge will not impact earnings or cash flow in 2005.
Outlook
The company continues to expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2005 to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.48. This range excludes non-cash impairment charges of approximately $34 million, or $0.12 per share, related to the United Kingdom Window Fashions business in the company's Home Fashions segment. This outlook also does not include total net losses reported as discontinued operations, including the company's European Cookware business, expected to be approximately $95 to $105 million. The company now expects internal sales to decline approximately 3% for the full year 2005, primarily reflecting the company's strategic decision to exit $200 million in annual revenue of low-margin product lines, the volume impact related to its pricing strategy and continued weakness in its European Window Fashions business.
For the fourth quarter 2005, the company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.38. The company expects internal sales to decline 2% to 4% in the fourth quarter.
A reconciliation of the 2005 earnings outlook is as follows:
For the full year 2005, the company now expects net cash from operating activities to be in the range of $610 to $660 million. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment are now expected to be in the range of $100 to $110 million and dividends are expected to be approximately $230 million for the full year 2005.
The company has not changed its previous 2006 guidance.
