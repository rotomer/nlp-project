Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On January 26, 2006, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. The Company's press release, dated January 26, 2006, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information for several years, both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, net income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding impairment and certain restructuring and other charges (and as a percentage of sales), and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding impairment and certain restructuring and other charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined as cash generated from operations, net of capital expenditures and dividends, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding impairment and certain restructuring and other charges, is also helpful to investors because it provides information, both historical and expected, with respect to earnings per share related to the Company's continuing
 
operations. Another purpose for which the Company uses or has used free cash flow and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring, impairment and other charges, are as two of the performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.

     (c) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2005 results, delivering continuing earnings per share for the year that exceeded its guidance.
ATLANTA, January 26, 2006
"The company generated strong momentum in 2005 and delivered results ahead of our commitments," said Mark Ketchum, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "This momentum is critical as we begin 2006 and execute Project Acceleration. Our team is fully engaged in driving strategic investment to build brands, achieving a best-cost position and further strengthening the portfolio."
Fourth Quarter Results
Income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, was $84.8 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to $120.8 million, or $0.44 per share, in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment, income from continuing operations was $113.4 million, or $0.41 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, compared to income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, of $124.5 million, or $0.45 per share, in the prior year. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales in the fourth quarter 2005 were $1.75 billion, compared to $1.73 billion in the prior year, an increase of 1.0 percent. Internal sales, which exclude the impact of material acquisitions and divestitures, declined 0.4 percent. Favorable pricing increased sales by 2.1 percent, offset by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines that reduced net sales by 2.3 percent and unfavorable foreign currency.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2005 improved to 29.4 percent, compared to 29.2 percent for the prior year. The company's productivity savings and favorable pricing offset raw material inflation.
"I am proud of the team for delivering results ahead of the commitments in a very challenging environment," said Ketchum. "We demonstrated growth in the "Invest" businesses and improvements to gross margin that have us encouraged about the prospects in 2006 and beyond."
Related to Project Acceleration, the company recorded non-cash restructuring charges of $51.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Additionally, consistent with previous guidance, the company recorded a non-cash charge to stockholders' equity of $59.8 million in the fourth quarter 2005 to record the under-funded status of the company's pension plans, which did not impact earnings or cash flow in 2005.

Net cash from operating activities was $190.3 million in the fourth quarter 2005, compared to $238.2 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by a voluntary contribution of approximately $25 million to fund one of the company's pension plans in the fourth quarter 2005. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter 2005 were $22.3 million compared to $26.8 million in the fourth quarter 2004. The company continued to pay a strong dividend in the quarter of $57.8 million, or $0.21 per share.
Strengthening the Portfolio
The company continues to make progress in its initiative to strengthen its portfolio of businesses, leveraging brand strength and product innovation in its core portfolio and divesting non-strategic businesses. During the fourth quarter 2005, the company completed its acquisition of DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. This transaction strengthens the company's global leadership position in the office products market and was neutral to earnings in 2005.
In addition, during the fourth quarter 2005, the company announced its agreement to sell its Newell Cookware Europe business, which sale closed shortly following the quarter end, on January 3, 2006. The company recorded a $7.8 million net loss related to this business in the fourth quarter 2005 as part of discontinued operations.
In the second quarter of 2005, the company committed to the divestiture of a business in the Cleaning & Organization segment. After winning several line reviews with key retailers and identifying significant productivity opportunities, the company decided in the fourth quarter 2005 to retain this business, which is now reflected in continuing operations. The impact to continuing earnings per share of this restatement was a $0.02 improvement to the September year-to-date results, offset by a $0.01 decline in the fourth quarter 2005, making the results of this business accretive to earnings per share by $0.01 for the full year 2005.
Full Year Results
Income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $356.4 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to $70.6 million, or $0.26 per share, in the prior year. Excluding impairment charges and restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration, income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $423.4 million, or $1.54 per share, compared to income from continuing operations, excluding impairment and restructuring charges, of $383.6 million, or $1.40 per share, in the prior year. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net sales for the full year 2005 were $6.34 billion, a decrease of 2.1 percent from $6.48 billion for the full year 2004. Internal sales declined 2.5 percent in 2005, impacted by positive pricing of 2.0 percent and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.7 percent. These were offset by the planned exit of certain low-margin product lines of 3.1 percent and additional declines primarily driven by weakness in the European Window Fashions and Little Tikes businesses.
Gross margin for the full year improved to 29.9 percent, compared to gross margin, excluding charges, of 28.6 percent for the full year 2004. This 130 basis point improvement reflects results

from the company's price increases, productivity initiatives and improved mix of higher margin products that more than offset record raw material inflation.
Net cash from operating activities was $641.6 million for the full year 2005, compared to $660.0 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures for the full year 2005 were $92.2 million compared to $121.9 million in the prior year, reflecting the company's continued decapitalization efforts.

For the full year 2005, the company recorded a net loss of $105.1 million related to the divestitures of non-core businesses, which is reported as discontinued operations.
Outlook
Full Year 2006
The company has revised its guidance upward and now expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2006 in the range of $1.55 to $1.65. This outlook includes expense of approximately $0.05 per share related to the adoption of Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised) ("SFAS 123(R)"), "Share-Based Payment."
