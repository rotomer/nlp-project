Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") approved and ratified, in accordance with the recommendations of the Organizational Development and Compensation Committee, an amendment to the Companys Management Cash Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). This amendment is made in connection with the Companys decision to decrease target bonus payouts for eligible employees, as reported in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 15, 2005. This previous decision resulted in a reduction of the target bonus percentage for the CEO from 134% of base salary to 105% of base salary, and for other executive officers from 100.5% of base salary to 65% of base salary. These percentages are applicable if performance targets are achieved at a 100% level. The decrease in target bonuses is part of the Companys decision to decrease the cash component, and increase the stock-based component, of incentive compensation to elig ible employees, as previously reported. The amendment adopted on February 8, 2006 would increase the maximum cash bonus payouts to eligible employees only if performance goals are attained at a level higher than 100%. The amendment is effective with respect to bonuses paid to eligible employees in 2007 based on the attainment of 2006 performance goals, and revises the maximum amounts of cash bonus paid if the target performance goals are achieved at a level substantially greater than 100%, as follows: (i) For the CEO of the Company, the maximum bonus as a percentage of salary is increased from 150% to 210%. (ii) For the group of participants that includes all executive officers other than the CEO, the maximum bonus as a percentage of salary is increased from 120.6% to 130%.
