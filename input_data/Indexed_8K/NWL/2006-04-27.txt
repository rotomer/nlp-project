Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On April 27, 2006, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006. The Company's press release, dated April 27, 2006, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used the financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, income from continuing operations and gross margin, excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment charges (and as a percentage of sales), and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, now defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends and further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, is as a performance goal that helps determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as

reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
In the first quarter of 2006, the Company began exploring various options for certain businesses in the Company's Home Fashions segment. In connection with this evaluation of alternatives, the Company obtained a better indication of the market value of these businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of their fair value. Due to the apparent decline in value, the Company conducted a new impairment test. The results of the impairment testing were reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which agreed with management's recommendations and concluded on April 25, 2006 that a $50.9 million impairment charge to write off the goodwill of the businesses is required under generally accepted accounting principles. This non-cash charge was recorded in the first quarter of 2006.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     
 
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported its first quarter 2006 results, delivering strong sales growth and continuing earnings per share that exceeded company guidance. Net sales in the first quarter 2006 were $1.48 billion, compared to $1.36 billion in the prior year, an increase of 8.9 percent. Internal sales increased 4.8 percent and were primarily driven by strong core sales growth and favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.
ATLANTA, April 27, 2006
"I am proud of the entire Newell Rubbermaid team for delivering strong sales growth and margin expansion while embracing the company's revised strategy of building Brands That Matter, creating scale advantages through horizontal integration, commercializing innovation across the enterprise and creating a structure for business globalization," said Mark Ketchum, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "We are making the necessary investments as we transform the business for long-term success."
Excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment charges, income from continuing operations was $129.9 million, or $0.47 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared to $89.4 million, or $0.33 per share, in the prior year. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter 2006 included a tax benefit of $78.0 million, or $0.28 per share, versus a tax benefit of $58.6 million, or $0.21 per share, in the first quarter of 2005. Income from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, was $56.4 million, or $0.21 per share, compared to $89.4 million, or $0.33 per share, in the prior year. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
"We are moving from Newell's historic focus on excellence in manufacturing and distributing products to excellence in innovating and marketing brands," added Ketchum. The company's Invest and Fix businesses exceeded internal plans. The Calphalon, Goody, Graco and Rubbermaid Commercial businesses grew double digits for the quarter, along with high single-digit growth in the Rubbermaid Food, and IRWIN and LENOX branded tool businesses. Businesses categorized as Fix also delivered sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from the timing of certain sales and favorable year-over-year comparisons.
Gross margin for the first quarter 2006 improved to 30.9 percent, a 340 basis point improvement over the prior year. The company's favorable pricing, productivity savings, and mix, driven largely by the DYMO acquisition, more than offset the impact of raw material inflation.
Related to Project Acceleration, the company recorded restructuring charges of $29.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. The company also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $50.9 million in the quarter to write off the goodwill for certain businesses in the company's Home Fashions segment.
Net cash used in operating activities was $11.7 million in the first quarter 2006, consistent with the

company's guidance, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $55.5 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an approximately $21 million payment to fund the company's 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan, and the timing of payments related to certain accrued liabilities. Capital expenditures in the first quarter 2006 were $25.3 million, compared to $23.1 million in the prior year. The company paid a strong dividend in the quarter of $58.2 million, or $0.21 per share.
2006 Outlook
Second Quarter
The company expects diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter 2006 to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.43. This outlook does not include approximately $20 to $35 million ($15 to $30 million after tax) of Project Acceleration restructuring charges.
The company expects internal sales growth in the low single-digit range in the second quarter 2006, cash from operating activities in the range of $20 to $60 million and capital expenditures in the range of $30 to $40 million. Dividends are expected to be approximately $58 million.
Full Year
The company now expects internal sales for the full year 2006 to grow in the low single digits, up from the previous flat sales guidance, driven by low- to mid-single digit growth in the company's Invest businesses and mid-single digit declines in its Fix businesses. The company now expects gross margin expansion of 200 to 250 basis points.
Excluding restructuring charges associated with Project Acceleration and impairment charges, the company now expects earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.65 to $1.75 for the full year, an increase of $0.10 per share over the previous range. This increase reflects the company's higher than expected tax benefit, higher sales outlook, improvement in gross margin and increased SG&A investments. The company continues to expect $550 to $600 million in cash from operating activities, including approximately $100 million of cash restructuring charges associated with Project Acceleration. The company also continues to expect capital expenditures of $125 to $150 million and dividends of approximately $232 million for the full year 2006.
