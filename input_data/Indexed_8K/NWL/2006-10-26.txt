Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 26, 2006, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006. The Company's press release, dated October 26, 2006, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends and further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, is as a performance goal that helps determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring and impairment charges, tax

benefits, pension curtailment and certain one-time non-operating benefits, and includes a proforma stock option expense for 2005, is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported third quarter 2006 results, reflecting strong sales growth and gross margin improvement.
ATLANTA, October 26, 2006
Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006 rose 10.4 percent to $1.59 billion, compared to $1.44 billion in the prior year. Internal sales, which excludes the effect of the DYMO acquisition, increased 6.3 percent in the third quarter 2006 as all reporting segments delivered positive internal sales growth, led by strength in Home & Family, Cleaning & Organization and Office Products. All reported sales figures exclude the results of the company's Little Tikes business, which was classified as discontinued operations during the third quarter 2006. Consistent with the company's second quarter 2006 earnings announcement, the results of Home Dcor Europe are also included in discontinued operations.
"Our employees and brands again delivered strong internal sales growth and gross margin expansion in the third quarter," said Mark Ketchum, chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "In addition, we continued the company's transformation through execution of key supply chain, marketing and other strategic initiatives. We also made significant progress toward optimizing the portfolio by entering into an agreement to sell the Little Tikes business."
Gross margin for the third quarter 2006 improved to 33.7 percent, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year. The expansion was driven by productivity, pricing and favorable mix, which more than offset raw material inflation.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $22.1 million in the third quarter 2006 and reversal of impairment in the third quarter 2005, income from continuing operations was $128.4 million, or $0.46 per share, for the third quarter 2006, exceeding company guidance and the prior year's result of $116.5 million, or $0.42 per share. The third quarter results for each of 2006 and 2005 include one-time tax benefits of approximately $15 million.
Income from continuing operations, as reported, was $112.7 million, or $0.41 per share, compared to $136.6 million, or $0.49 per share, in the prior year. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $312.2 million in the third quarter 2006, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $359.4 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $36.9 million in the third quarter 2006, versus $23.9 million in the prior year. Dividends paid were $58.2 million, or $0.21 per share, in the third quarter 2006, versus $57.9 million in the prior year.
Nine Month Results
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 grew 10.4 percent to $4.56 billion, compared to $4.13 billion in the prior year. Internal sales increased 6.1 percent due primarily to strong core sales growth. The Calphalon, Rubbermaid Home and Goody businesses posted double digit sales growth, while the Rubbermaid Commercial, Graco, and Irwin and Lenox branded businesses delivered high single digit growth.
Gross margin was 33.5 percent, a 260 basis point improvement over the prior year. The expansion reflects strong productivity, mix and pricing, which more than offset raw material inflation.
