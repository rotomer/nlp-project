Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On January 30, 2007, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company's press release, dated January 30, 2007, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges related to Project Acceleration and impairment charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends and further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, is as a performance goal that helps determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring and impairment charges, tax benefits, pension curtailment and certain one-time non-operating benefits, and includes a proforma stock option expense for 2005, is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2006 results, reflecting strong annual internal sales growth and gross margin expansion.
ATLANTA, January 30, 2007
Full Year 2006 Results
Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 grew 8.5 percent to $6.20 billion, compared to $5.72 billion in the prior year. Internal sales, which excludes the effect of the DYMO acquisition, increased 4.7 percent. The Home & Family segment posted double digit sales growth, while Office Products, Rubbermaid Home, Rubbermaid Commercial and the Irwin and Lenox branded businesses delivered mid single digit sales increases.
"2006 was a very successful year for Newell Rubbermaid. Through the hard work of our employees, we made tremendous progress generating sustainable sales growth, expanding gross margin and optimizing our portfolio," said Mark Ketchum, president and chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "We will build on these accomplishments in 2007 as we continue our multi-year transformation into a global consumer products company with world class talent and processes, best total cost position and brands that matter to the consumer."
Gross margin was 33.4 percent, a 260 basis point improvement over the prior year. The expansion reflects strong productivity, pricing and favorable mix, partially offset by raw material inflation.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $66.4 million in 2006 and $51.2 million in 2005, operating income improved $104.0 million to $723.0 million, a 16.8 percent increase over the prior year.

Income from continuing operations, as reported, was $470.7 million, or $1.71 per share, compared to $406.3 million, or $1.48 per share, in the prior year. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $643.4 million, compared to $641.6 million for the prior year. Capital expenditures were $138.3 million, compared to $92.2 million for the prior year. Dividends were $232.8 million, compared to $231.5 million for the prior year.

Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
Net sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 rose 3.5 percent to $1.64 billion, compared to $1.58 billion in the prior year. Internal sales increased 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter 2006, led by high single digit growth in the Office Products and Home & Family

segments.

2007 Outlook
Full Year 2007
The company believes internal sales growth will be in the low to mid single digits, driven primarily by core sales growth and favorable currency. The company projects full year gross margin expansion of 125 to 175 basis points.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of approximately $100 to $130 million ($85 to $110 million after tax), the company believes earnings per share from continuing operations will range from $1.69 to $1.75 for the full year. Net cash provided by operating activities is forecast between $575 and $625 million, including approximately $100 to $125 million in cash restructuring costs in connection with Project Acceleration.
