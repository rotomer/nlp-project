Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On July 26, 2007, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2007. The Company's press release, dated July 26, 2007, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends and further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, is as a performance goal that helps determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and one-time tax benefits is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance.

While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported second quarter 2007 results, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion, and improvement in operating income and cash flow. In addition, management reaffirmed full year guidance.
ATLANTA, July 26, 2007
Net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 rose 3.6 percent to $1.69 billion, compared to $1.63 billion in the prior year. Leading the way were the Home & Family segment with high single digit growth and Cleaning, Organization & Dcor with mid single digit growth.
"We continue to make solid progress in our multi-year transformation to a best-in-class, global consumer products company," said Mark Ketchum, president and chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "For the seventh consecutive quarter, Newell Rubbermaid posted positive sales growth, driven by our new business model. I am particularly proud of our ability to compensate for a difficult manufacturing restructuring project in Europe and softness in several retail channels."
Gross margin for the second quarter 2007 improved to 35.8 percent, a 130 basis point improvement over the prior year. The expansion was driven primarily by productivity improvements, including the impact of Project Acceleration.
Normalized earnings, which excludes Project Acceleration restructuring costs and the effect of one-time tax items, were $0.55 per share in the second quarter 2007, a 20 percent increase over the prior year's result of $0.46 per share.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $15.5 million in 2007 and $19.1 million in 2006, operating income improved $27.5 million to $248.3 million, a 12.5 percent increase over the prior year. Excluding charges, income from continuing operations was $154.6 million, or $0.55 per share, for the second quarter 2007, compared to the prior year's result of $149.0 million, or $0.54 per share. Income from continuing operations in the second quarter 2006 included a one-time tax benefit of $22.7 million, or $0.08 per share. A reconciliation of the results "as reported" to results "excluding charges" is attached to this press release.
Income from continuing operations, as reported, was $143.2 million, or $0.51 per share, for the second quarter 2007, compared to $135.5 million, or $0.49 per share, in the prior year.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $158.3 million in the second quarter 2007, compared to $103.8 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $36.4 million, versus $31.9 million in the prior year.
