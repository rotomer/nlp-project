Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 25, 2007, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007. The Company's press release, dated October 25, 2007, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
The Company's management believes that operating income, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends and further investment in future growth initiatives. Another purpose for which the Company uses diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring charges, is as a performance goal that helps determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and one-time tax benefits is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance.
 
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c) Exhibits.
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NYSE: NWL) today reported third quarter 2007 results, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and improvement in operating income. In addition, management raised its full year earnings per share and cash flow guidance and guided full year gross margin expansion to the high-end of the range.
ATLANTA, October 25, 2007
"We are pleased to report that we have delivered another quality quarter, generating an attractive balance of internal sales growth, gross margin expansion, EPS growth and cash generation," said Mark Ketchum, president and chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid.  "Our 2007 results demonstrate that the strategies are working and serve as a validation of our business model.  We remain on track to meet or exceed all performance commitments established at the beginning of the year."
Successful Implementation of SAP
During the quarter, the North American Office Products business successfully implemented SAP. This SAP go-live marks the completion of the first major milestone aimed at migrating non-standard legacy systems and users to a common SAP platform. This multi-year program will enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting process more efficiently.
Quarterly Financial Highlights
Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007 rose 6.4 percent to $1.69 billion, compared to $1.59 billion in the prior year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of internal sales growth for the company. Sales growth, excluding foreign currency, was 4.5 percent. The sales growth was driven by broad based strength across all segments and benefited by approximately 150 basis points from the timing of sales in the Office Products segment relating to the third quarter pre-buy in advance of the SAP implementation and the recovery of lost second quarter sales associated with service level issues in Europe.
Gross margin for the third quarter 2007 improved to 35.6 percent, a 190 basis point improvement over the prior year, exceeding the high end of the company's revised guidance. The expansion was driven primarily by favorable mix and productivity improvements, including the impact of Project Acceleration.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $22.7 million in 2007 and $22.1 million in 2006, operating income improved $36.2 million to $236.5 million, an 18 percent increase over the prior year.

Acceleration savings and ongoing productivity initiatives, combined with favorable mix, will drive the gross margin expansion.
Normalized earnings are expected to range from $1.79 to $1.81 per diluted share.
Net cash provided by operating activities is now forecast between $650 and $700 million, including approximately $50 to $60 million in cash restructuring payments. The company continues to project annualized savings in excess of $150 million from Project Acceleration upon completion in 2009, now including $60 million of savings in 2007. The company now expects capital expenditures of $145 to $155 million, including SAP, and dividends of approximately $235 million.
Fourth Quarter Guidance
The company believes sales will increase approximately 2 percent. Sales in the quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points as certain retailers purchased product in advance of the SAP go-live at North American Office Products.
Savings from Project Acceleration activities along with other ongoing productivity initiatives and favorable mix will drive expected gross margin expansion of between 175 and 225 basis points.
Normalized earnings are expected to range from $0.44 to $0.46 per diluted share.
Net cash provided by operating activities is forecast in the range of $200 to $250 million. The company expects capital expenditures of $35 to $45 million.
2008 Outlook
The company expects sales growth of 3 to 5 percent for the full year with growth expected across all business segments. New products and increased strategic SG&A spending are expected to more than offset the impact of a continued sluggish economic environment in North America. Project Acceleration, and other productivity initiatives, are expected to fuel gross margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. Approximately half of this expansion will be invested in strategic brand building and corporate initiatives. Sales growth and gross margin expansion will drive normalized EPS to a range of $1.95 to $2.00.
"2008 continues to build upon the positive momentum experienced in 2007," said Mark Ketchum, president and chief executive officer of Newell Rubbermaid. "We continue to make the necessary investments in consumer understanding, innovation and demand creation activities aimed at positioning Newell Rubbermaid for long-term success. We are proud of the progress we've made thus far and excited about the improvements that are yet to come."
