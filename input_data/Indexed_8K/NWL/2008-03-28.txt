Indemnification and Contribution.
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheets required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(c) hereto or the Final Supplemented Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any and all legal or other expenses whatsoever, as incurred (including fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Underwriters) reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be
 
liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements described in Section C of Schedule I which appear in the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Supplemented Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of
 
such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; provided, however, that in no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local counsel) representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action, claim, or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action, claim or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and by the Underwriters from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Supplemented Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such alleged untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, and each director, officer,
 
employee or agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
     9. 
Payment of Expenses.
          The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including:

          (g) The preparation, printing or other reproduction and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of the Indenture and all supplements and amendments thereto;
          (h) Any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities;
          (i) The fees and expenses, if any, incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or listing on a securities exchange;
          (j) Any advertising and other out-of-pocket expenses of the Underwriters incurred with the approval of the Company;
          (k) The cost of providing any CUSIP or other identification numbers for the Securities; and
          (l) The fees and expenses of DTC (as defined in the Indenture) and any nominees thereof in connection with the Securities.
 
     10. 
Default by an Underwriter.
          If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

The provisions of Section 8 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
     12. 
Termination of this Agreement.
          This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to the Closing Date (i) if there shall have been, since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Supplemented Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if, since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any
 
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering and delivery of the Securities, or (iii) if, since the date of this Agreement, trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the SEC or a national securities exchange or the over-the-counter markets, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter markets shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities shall have been required, by either of said Exchanges, the over-the-counter markets or by order of the SEC or any other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York authorities or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign currency or currencies in which the Securities are denominated or payable, or if a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance service in such country shall have occurred, or (iv) if the rating assigned by any nationally recognized securities rating agency to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of this Agreement shall have been lowered since that date or if any such rating agency shall have publicly announced (other than a reaffirmation of a previous announcement) since such date that it has under a surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (v) if there shall have come to the Representatives' attention any facts that would cause the Representatives to reasonably believe that the Final Supplemented Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to the Underwriters, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.

Exhibit 4.1
UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION (THE "DEPOSITARY") (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK), TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY, AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY, ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
UNLESS AND UNTIL THIS CERTIFICATE IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR CERTIFICATES IN DEFINITIVE REGISTERED FORM, THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE (A) BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE THEREOF OR (B) BY A NOMINEE THEREOF TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR (C) BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.
          Newell Rubbermaid Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($500,000,000) on April 15, 2013 and to pay interest, semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing October 15, 2008 on said principal sum at the rate of 5.50% per annum, from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from March 28, 2008, until payment of said principal sum has been made. The interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1, as the case may be (each, a "Record Date"), next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The amount of interest payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The principal of and interest on this Security are payable in such coin or currency of the United States of America as
 
at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts at the office or agency of the Company in the Place of Payment, and at such other locations as the Company may from time to time designate. Any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in said Indenture.
          Reference is made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
          Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture, or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, THE COMPANY HAS CAUSED THIS INSTRUMENT TO BE DULY EXECUTED UNDER ITS CORPORATE SEAL.
Dated: March 28, 2008
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 5.50% Notes due 2013 (Securities of such series being hereinafter called the "Securities"), limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000, issued under the senior indenture dated as of November 1, 1995, (hereinafter called the "Indenture"), between the Company (as successor to Newell Co.) and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association)), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Securities of this series), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and any Holder of the Securities, and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
          Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, this Security will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Security will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and ownership of this Security shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin and currency, herein prescribed.
          Securities will be redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time prior to maturity (any such date of redemption, the "Redemption Date"), on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice mailed to Holders thereof, at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the Redemption Date and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 50 basis points, in each case as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus, in the case of both (a) and (b) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. The Redemption Price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. The Securities will be redeemed in increments of $1,000.
 
          "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
          "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
          "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Company obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (c) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Quotation.
          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (a) Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors, , that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (b) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
provided, however
          "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.
          On and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities, or any portion of the Securities, called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before the Redemption Date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by DTC or, if the Securities are not represented by a global security, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
          If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Securities. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities
 
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment").
          Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice will be mailed to Holders of the Securities describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
          In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, this Security together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed hereto) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
          Upon the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of the Securities properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities
 
properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being repurchased.
          The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions contained herein, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions contained herein by virtue of any such conflict.
          For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions, the following terms will be applicable:
          "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Company's outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Company's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person or any direct or indirect parent company of the surviving person, immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, THE COMPANY HAS CAUSED THIS INSTRUMENT TO BE DULY EXECUTED UNDER ITS CORPORATE SEAL.
Dated: March 28, 2008
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 6.25% Notes due 2018 (Securities of such series being hereinafter called the "Securities"), limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $250,000,000, issued under the senior indenture dated as of November 1, 1995, (hereinafter called the "Indenture"), between the Company (as successor to Newell Co.) and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association)), as trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the Securities of this series), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and any Holder of the Securities, and the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
          Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, this Security will be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. This Security will not be issued in definitive form, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and ownership of this Security shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts of participating organizations of the Depositary.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin and currency, herein prescribed.
          Securities will be redeemable in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time prior to maturity (any such date of redemption, the "Redemption Date"), on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice mailed to Holders thereof, at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed on the Redemption Date and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed on that Redemption Date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below), plus 50 basis points, in each case as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus, in the case of both (a) and (b) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. The Redemption Price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Securities called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. The Securities will be redeemed in increments of $1,000.
 
          "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
          "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
          "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the Company obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (c) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Quotation.
          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (a) Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors, , that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (b) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
provided, however
          "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.
          On and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities, or any portion of the Securities, called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before the Redemption Date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by DTC or, if the Securities are not represented by a global security, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
          If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Securities, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Securities. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities
 
repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of repurchase (a "Change of Control Payment").
          Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice will be mailed to Holders of the Securities describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
          In order to accept the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least three Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, this Security together with the form entitled "Election Form" (which form is annexed hereto) duly completed, or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
Any exercise by a Holder of its election to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repurchase must be equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
          Upon the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of the Securities properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities
 
properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being repurchased.
          The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a Default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions contained herein, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions contained herein by virtue of any such conflict.

The Registration Statement, which became effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, relates to the issuance and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act, of, among other securities, senior and subordinated debt securities, consisting of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more series. We have also acted as counsel to the Company in connection with (i) the issuance and sale of the Company's 5.50% Notes Due April 15, 2013 in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 (the "Five Year Notes") in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated as of March 25, 2008 among the Company and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement") and (ii) the issuance and sale of the Company's 6.25% Notes due 2018 in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000 (the "Ten Year Notes", and, together with the Five Year Notes, the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
     The Notes are to be issued under an indenture, dated as of November 1, 1995, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.

In addition, in rendering such opinions we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification, (i) that the execution and delivery of, and performance of their respective obligations under, the documents executed or to be executed by each party thereto, other than the Company, do not violate any law, rule, regulation, agreement or instrument binding upon such party and (ii) that each of such documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and enforceable against, each party thereto, other than the Company.

     The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
     A. The opinions expressed herein with respect to the legality, validity, binding nature and enforceability of the Notes are subject to (i) applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, whether now or hereafter in effect and (ii) general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, laches, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the principles regarding when injunctive or other equitable remedies will be available (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
