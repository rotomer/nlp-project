(b) In a Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 7, 2009, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") previously disclosed that J. Patrick Robinson, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, had informed the Company of his intention to take early retirement. In connection with the election of a successor Chief Financial Officer as described below in (c), Mr. Robinson resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective December 7, 2009. (c) On December 3, 2009, the Company announced the appointment of Juan Figuereo as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective December 7, 2009 (the "Hire Date"). Under the Companys By-Laws, officers are elected annually after each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and Mr. Figuereos term of office shall continue until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. A copy of the news release announcing Mr. Figuereos election is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Mr. Figuereo, 54, most recently served as Chief Financial Officer of Cott Corporation (a non-alcoholic beverage company and retailer brand soft drink provider) from March 2007 to September 2009. Prior to joining Cott, he served as Vice President, Mergers and Acquisitions for Wal-Mart International from July 2003 to March 2007. Prior to July 2003, he spent 15 years with PepsiCo in a variety of international finance and general management roles, first within the Pepsi-Cola organization and then in the Frito-Lay business. He held Chief Financial Officer roles for Frito-Lay in Southern Europe, and for Pepsi-Cola Latin America, as well as a stint as seconded CFO of the largest Pepsi bottler in Brazil. Mr. Figuereo was not selected pursuant to any arrangement or understanding between him and any other person. Other than his employment relationship, Mr. Figuereo does not have a direct or indirect material interest in any transaction to which the Company is a party. There are no fa mily relationships between Mr. Figuereo and any of the Companys other directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by the Company to become directors or executive officers. The material components of Mr. Figuereos compensation are as follows: (i) Base salary of $520,000 per year. (ii) A signing bonus of $150,000. (iii) An annual bonus opportunity under the Companys Management Cash Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") with a target payout equal to 75% of base salary and a maximum payout equal to 150% of base salary, based on attainment of applicable performance criteria and payout levels. Mr. Figuereo will first be eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan beginning in 2010. (iv) A Company-paid automobile lease for a vehicle worth up to $60,000. (v) Beginning in 2010, participation in the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"), under which Mr. Figuereo will be granted annual awards of stock options and restricted st ock units under the Companys 2003 Stock Plan. The value of Mr. Figuereos target award under the LTIP will be equal to 170% of base salary, and stock options and restricted stock units issued under the LTIP are subject to a three-year cliff vesting period. (vi) Participation in the Companys 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan and in other benefit plans provided to Company employees generally, including the Total Retirement Savings Program. Under the Total Retirement Savings Program, Mr. Figuereo will receive an annual Company contribution to his 401(k) Savings Plan account equal to 4% of his eligible earnings. (vii) A one-time grant of a stock option under the Companys 2003 Stock Plan to acquire 50,000 shares of Company stock subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company stock on the Hire Date. (viii) A one-time award on the Hire Date, of 15,000 time-based restricted stock units under the Compan ys 2003 Stock Plan, with a three-year cliff vesting period. (ix) An additional one-time award in February 2010, of 10,000 time-based restricted stock units under the Companys 2003 Stock Plan, with a three-year cliff vesting period. (x) Participation in the Companys executive relocation program. The Company will also enter into an employment security agreement (the "ESA") with Mr. Figuereo. A complete copy of the form ESA to be entered into by Mr. Figuereo is filed with this Current Report as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by this reference. The form of ESA provides for the continuation of an executives salary, bonus and certain employee benefits for a severance period of 24 months upon an involuntary termination of employment without "good cause," or a voluntary termination of employment for "good reason," occurring within 24 months after a "change in control" of the Company. Within 30 days after any such termination, the executive will rece ive a lump sum severance payment equal to (i) two times the sum of (A) the executives annual base salary, determined as of the date of the change in control or, if higher, the date of employment termination and (B) the executives target bonus on the date of the change in control or, if higher, the date of termination, and assuming the attainment of performance goals at the 100% level, plus (ii) the executive's target bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs through the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365. Following such a termination of employment, (i) the executive will receive all benefits accrued under the Companys incentive and retirement plans and he will become fully vested under the Companys 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan and 401(k) Plan, (ii) all Company stock options held by the executive will become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for a period of three years thereafter or, if shorter, the remaining term of the options, all restrictions on Company restricted stock and restricted stock units held by the executive will lapse, and all performance goals on Company performance awards to the executive will be deemed satisfied at the target level; (iii) the executive and his spouse and eligible dependents will continue to be covered by all welfare plans of the Company during the severance period, until the executive is eligible for coverage under similar plans from a new employer (with coverage provided under a group health plan to be provided under COBRA with the executive responsible for that portion of COBRA premiums that would have been paid by the executive for coverage if he were an active employee), and (iv) the executive will be eligible for six months of outplacement services. The form of ESA does not provide for a gross-up payment to the executive to cover any excise and related income tax liability under Section 4999 of th e Internal Revenue Code as a result of any payment or benefit arising under the ESA. Rather, payments and benefits payable to an executive would be reduced to the extent necessary so that no excise tax would be imposed if doing so would result in the executive retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits. If the executive dies during the severance period, all amounts payable during the remainder of the severance period will be paid to his surviving spouse, and such spouse will continue to be covered under all applicable welfare plans. The ESA contains restrictive covenants which prohibit the executive from (i) associating with a business that is competitive with any line of business of the Company for which the executive provided services, without the Companys consent and (ii) soliciting the Companys agents and employees. These restrictive covenants remain in effect for a period of 24 months followi ng any termination of employment.

(vi) Employer materially breaches the provisions of this Agreement;

Termination of Employment
4. . Upon termination of Executive's employment with Employer under circumstances described in Section 3 above:
Benefits Upon Termination of Employment
(a) Employer shall pay Executive, in a lump sum as soon as practicable following Executive's termination of employment, but in no event later than 30 days following such termination, the sum of:
(i) two (2) times the sum of the Executive's Base Salary and the Executive's Bonus; plus
(ii) the Executive's Bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs through the date of termination and the denominator of which is 365.
(b) Executive shall be entitled to receive any and all benefits accrued under any other Incentive Plans to the date of termination of employment, the amount, entitlement to, form and time of payment of such benefits to be determined by the terms of such Incentive Plans. For purposes of calculating Executive's benefits under the Incentive Plans, Executive's employment shall be deemed to have terminated by reason of retirement under circumstances that have the most favorable result for Executive thereunder.
(c) Executive's benefits accrued or credited through the date of termination of employment under the Newell Rubbermaid Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or its successor ("SERP") and the Newell Rubbermaid Inc. 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan, or its successor (the "2008 Deferred Compensation Plan") that are not vested as of the date of termination of employment shall be fully vested and paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan (subject to any forfeiture provisions applicable to the plans). Employer shall also pay to the Executive, in a lump sum as soon as practicable following Executive's termination of employment, but in no event later than 30 days following such termination, an amount equal to the Executive's benefits accrued or credited through the date of termination of employment under the Employer's qualified defined contribution plans that are not vested as of the date of termination of employment.
(d) If upon the date of termination of Executive's employment, Executive holds any awards with respect to securities of Employer, (i) all such awards that are options shall immediately become exercisable upon such date and shall be exercisable thereafter until the earlier of the third anniversary of Executive's termination of employment or the expiration of the term of the options; (ii) all restrictions on any awards of restricted securities shall terminate or lapse; and (iii) all performance goals applicable to any performance-based awards shall be deemed satisfied at the "target" level and paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.
(e) During the Severance Period, Executive and his spouse and eligible dependents shall be eligible for coverage under the Welfare Plans as follows:
(i) Coverage during the Severance Period under any Welfare Plan that is a group health plan as defined in Title I, Part 6 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("COBRA"), shall be provided under COBRA, except that the maximum coverage period shall be extended from 18 to 24 months. If Executive, his spouse, and/or his dependents elect COBRA coverage under any Welfare Plan, Employer shall pay a portion of the COBRA premiums. The portion to be paid by Employer shall equal the amount necessary so that the total of the COBRA premiums paid by Executive, his spouse, and/or his dependents is equal to the premium that would have been paid by Executive for such coverage as an active employee immediately prior to the Change in Control.
(ii) Executive and his spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to be covered by all other Welfare Plans in which he or his spouse or eligible dependents were participating immediately prior to the date of his termination of employment, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of those plans as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or, if more favorable to Executive, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other senior executives of Employer, as if he continued to be an active employee of Employer, and Employer shall continue to pay the costs of such coverage under such Welfare Plans on the same basis as is applicable to active employees covered thereunder as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; provided that, if participation in any one or more of such Welfare Plans is not possible under the terms thereof, Employer shall provide substantially identical benefits.
The coverage provided under this Section 4(e) shall cease if and when Executive obtains employment with another employer during the Severance Period and becomes eligible for coverage under any substantially similar plans provided by his new employer.
(f) Executive shall be entitled to payment for any accrued but unused vacation in accordance with Employer's policy in effect at Executive's termination of employment in a lump sum as soon as practicable following Executive's termination of employment, but in no event later than 30 days following such termination. Executive shall not be entitled to receive any payments or other compensation attributable to vacation he would have earned had his employment continued during the Severance Period, and Executive waives any right to receive such compensation.
(g) Employer shall, at Employer's expense, provide Executive with six months of executive outplacement services with a professional outplacement firm selected by Employer; provided that the outplacement services must be used by the Executive by no later than the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the termination of employment occurred.
(h) Executive shall not be entitled to reimbursement for fringe benefits during the Severance Period, such as dues and expenses related to club memberships, automobile, cell phone, expenses for professional services and other similar perquisites.
5. . Employer's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which Employer or any of its affiliated companies may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment, except as expressly provided in subsection 4(e).
Setoff
6. . If Executive dies during the Severance Period, all amounts payable hereunder to Executive shall, to the extent not paid, be paid to his surviving spouse or his designated beneficiary, or if none, then to his estate. Executive's surviving spouse and eligible dependents shall continue to be covered under all applicable Welfare Plans during the remainder of the Severance Period. On the death of the surviving spouse and eligible dependants, no further Welfare Plan coverage shall be provided (other than any coverage required pursuant to Title I, Part 6 of COBRA), and no further benefits shall be paid, except for benefits accrued under any Incentive Plans and Retirement Plans to the date of Executive's termination of employment, to the extent such benefits continue following Executive's death pursuant to the term of such Plans.
Death
7. .
Certain Reductions in Payments
(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm designated by Employer prior to a Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all payments, benefits or distributions by Employer or its affiliates in the nature of compensation to or for Executive's benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (a "Payment") would (after taking into account any value attributable to the non-competition covenant in Section 8), subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the "Agreement Payments") to the Reduced Amount (as defined below in Section 7(d)). The Agreement Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below in Section 7(d)) of aggregate Payments if Executive's Agreement Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount. If instead the Accounting Firm determines that Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if Executive's Agreement Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount, Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the value (if any) attributable to the non-competition covenant in Section 8 be taken into account for purposes of the Accounting Firm's determination if it would reduce the Agreement Payments to be paid to Executive, it being understood that any such valuation is intended solely to reduce the amounts that are considered "parachute payments" and therefore reduce any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Any valuation of the non-competition covenant in Section 8 shall be determined by the Accounting Firm (or, if the Accounting Firm is not able to make such determination, an independent third-party valuation specialist, selected by Employer), and Employer shall cooperate in good faith in connection with any such valuation process.
(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, Employer shall promptly give Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm (or, with respect to the valuation of the non-competition covenant in Section 8, to the extent applicable, the independent third-party valuation specialist) under this Section 7 shall be binding upon Employer and Executive and shall be made within thirty (30) days after a termination of Executive's employment. The reduction of the Agreement Payments to the Reduced Amount, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the Agreement Payments under the following sections (and no other Payments) in the following order: (i) Section 4(a), (ii) Section 4(c), and (iii) Section 4(g). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and the independent third-party valuation specialist (if any) shall be borne solely by Employer.
(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by Employer to or for the benefit of Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by Employer to or for the benefit of Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either Employer or Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall pay any such Overpayment to Employer together with at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Executive to Employer if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Executive is subject to tax under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Employer to or for the benefit of Executive (Subject to Section 14) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.
(d) For purposes hereof, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:
(i) "Net After-Tax Receipt" shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Executive's taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as Executive certifies, in Executive's sole discretion, as likely to apply to him or her in the relevant tax year(s).
(ii) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest amount of Agreement Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Agreement Payments pursuant to Section 7(a).
8. . During the Term of this Agreement, Executive shall not be associated, directly or indirectly, as an employee, proprietor, stockholder, partner, agent, representative, officer, or otherwise, with the operation of any business that is competitive with any line of business of Employer or any Affiliate for which Executive has provided substantial services without the prior written consent of Employer, which shall not unreasonably be withheld, except that Executive's ownership (or that of his wife and children) of publicly-traded securities of any such business having a cost of not more than $250,000 shall not be considered a violation of this Section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Executive shall be considered as the "stockholder" of any equity securities owned by his spouse and all relatives and children residing in Executive's principal residence.
Restrictive Covenants
9. . Executive agrees that he shall not, during the Term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, in his individual capacity or otherwise, induce, cause, persuade, or attempt to do any of the foregoing in order to cause, any representative, agent or employee of Employer or any Affiliate to terminate such person's employment relationship with Employer or any Affiliate, or to violate the terms of any agreement between said representative, agent or employee and Employer or any Affiliate.
No Solicitation of Representatives and Employees
10. . Executive acknowledges that preservation of a continuing business relationship between Employer or its Affiliates and their respective customers, representatives, and employees is of critical importance to the continued business success of Employer and that it is the active policy of Employer and its Affiliates to guard as confidential the identity of its customers, trade secrets, pricing policies, business affairs, representatives and employees. In view of the foregoing, Executive agrees that he shall not, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, without the prior written consent of Employer (which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably), disclose to any person or entity any information concerning the business of, or any customer, representative, agent or employee of, Employer or its Affiliates which was obtained by Executive in the course of his employment by Employer. This section shall not be applicable if and to the extent Executive is required to testify in a legislative, judicial or regulatory proceeding pursuant to an order of Congress, any state or local legislature, a judge, or an administrative law judge.
Confidentiality
11. . No interest of Executive or his spouse or any other beneficiary under this Agreement, or any right to receive any payment or distribution hereunder, shall be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind, nor may such interest or right to receive a payment or distribution be taken, voluntarily or involuntarily, for the satisfaction of the obligations or debts of, or other claims against, Executive or his spouse or other beneficiary, by operation of law or otherwise, other than pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order to which Executive is a party.
Executive Assignment
12. .
Funding
(a) Prior to a Change in Control, all rights of Executive and his spouse or other beneficiary under this Agreement shall at all times be entirely unfunded and no provision shall at any time be made with respect to segregating any assets of Employer for payment of any amounts due hereunder. Neither Executive nor his spouse or other beneficiary shall have any interest in or rights against any specific assets of Employer, and Executive and his spouse or other beneficiary shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of Employer.
(b) No later than five days following a Change in Control, Employer shall establish an irrevocable grantor trust, substantially in the form of the model trust agreement set forth in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 96-24, or any subsequent Revenue Procedure, and shall make a contribution to the trust in an amount equal to the cash payments that would be made to Executive pursuant to Sections 4 and 7 upon a termination of his employment under circumstances described in Section 3, such amount to be determined as if Executive's termination of employment occurred on the date of the Change in Control. At six-month intervals commencing from the date of the Change in Control, Employer shall recalculate the amount necessary to fully fund the above-described benefits and, if the amount exceeds the fair market value of the assets then held in the trust, Employer shall promptly deposit an amount equal to such excess. Employer shall not terminate the trust until the Term of the Agreement has ended and all cash payments described in Section 4 to which Executive is entitled have been made to Executive. Employer shall provide Executive with written confirmation of the establishment of the trust and the deposit of the required amount on his behalf, including a written accounting of the calculation of such amounts. Employer's failure to establish a trust and provide such written notice shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 12(b) shall be construed and applied in a manner so as to avoid the application of Section 409A(b)(3) of the Code.
13. . Employer shall pay as incurred (within 10 calendar days following Employer's receipt of an invoice from the Executive) Executive's out-of-pocket expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by Executive at any time from the date of this Agreement through the Executive's remaining lifetime or, if longer, through the 20th anniversary of the date of the Change of Control, in connection with any action taken to enforce this Agreement or construe or determine the validity of this Agreement or otherwise in connection herewith, including any claim or legal action or proceeding, whether brought by Executive or Employer or another party, and whether or not Executive is successful with respect to such action taken; provided, that the Executive shall have submitted an invoice for such fees and expenses at least 15 calendar days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred. The amount of such legal fees and expenses that Employer is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the legal fees and expenses that Employer is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and the Executive's right to have Employer pay such legal fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. Employer's obligation to pay Executive's eligible legal fees and expenses under this Section 12 shall not be conditioned upon Executive's termination of employment.
Legal Expenses
14. .
Section 409A
(a) The amounts payable pursuant to Section 4 above are intended to be separate payments that are exempt from Section 409A of the Code by reason of the "short-term deferral" exception or the separation pay exceptions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that an amount payable under Section 4 does not comply with any of these exceptions, then they shall be subject to the following rules:
(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is a "specified employee," as determined under Employer's policy for determining specified employees on the date of his termination of employment, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits or reimbursements paid or provided under this Agreement that constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that are provided as a result of a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following the date of such termination of employment shall be accumulated through and paid or provided (together with interest at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code in effect on the date of termination of employment) within 30 days after the first business day following the six month anniversary of such termination of employment (or, if the Executive dies during such six-month period, within 30 days after the Executive's death).
(ii) The benefits described in paragraphs (e), (f) and (h) of Section 4 that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A of the Code set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations. To the extent that any of those benefits either do not qualify for that exception, or are provided beyond the applicable time periods set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations, then they shall be subject to the following additional rules: (1) any reimbursement of eligible expenses shall be paid within 60 calendar days following Executive's written request for reimbursement, or such later date set forth in Section 14(a)(i); provided that the Executive provides written notice no later than 75 calendar days prior to the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred so that Employer can make the reimbursement within the time periods required by Section 409A of the Code; (2) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, during any other calendar year; and (3) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "termination of employment" or words or phrases of similar import shall mean a "separation from service" with the Employer within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. In this regard, Employer and the Executive shall take all steps necessary (including with regard to any post-termination services by the Executive) to ensure that (i) any termination of employment under this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the date of the termination of employment for purposes of this Agreement.
(c) It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the Employer shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent. Without limiting the foregoing, the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code upon Executive. Although the Employer shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Employer, its Affiliates nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by the Executive or other taxpayer as a result of the Agreement.
15. . No waiver by any party at any time of any breach by any other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by any other party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions or conditions at the same time or at any prior or subsequent time.
Waiver
16. . This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of Delaware.
Applicable Law
17. . This Agreement contains the entire Agreement between Employer and Executive and supersedes any and all previous agreements, written or oral, between the parties relating to severance benefits in the event of a Change in Control, including any previous Employment Security Agreement between Executive and Employer. No amendment or modification of the terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto unless reduced to writing and signed by Employer and Executive.
Entire Agreement
18. . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to be an employment contract between Executive and Employer. Executive is employed at will and Employer may terminate his employment at any time, with or without cause.
No Employment Contract
19. . In the event any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or invalid, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
Severability
20. . If Executive is employed by Employer and an Affiliate, or solely by an Affiliate, on the date of termination of employment of Executive under circumstances described in Section 3, then (a) employment or termination of employment as used in this Agreement shall mean employment or termination of employment of Executive with Employer and such Affiliate, or with such Affiliate, as applicable, and related references to Employer shall also include Affiliate, as applicable, and (b) the obligations of Employer hereunder shall be satisfied by Employer and/or such Affiliate as Employer, in its discretion, shall determine; provided that Employer shall remain liable for such obligations to the extent not satisfied by such Affiliate.
Employment with an Affiliate
21. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, representatives and successors. Any reference in this Agreement to Employer shall be deemed a reference to any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase of stock or assets, merger or consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Employer; provided that Executive's employment by a successor Employer shall not be deemed a termination of Executive's employment with Employer (unless otherwise required in order to comply with the definition of "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code).
Successors
22. . Except with respect to agreements regarding severance payments described in Section 17, the provisions of this Agreement shall not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of time, under any other employment agreement or other contract, plan or arrangement with Employer or an Affiliate.
Non-exclusivity
23. . Notices required under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the following addresses or to such other address as the party being notified may have previously furnished to the others by written notice.
Notice
24. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.
