Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On April 30, 2010, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010. The Company's press release, dated April 30, 2010, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
 
 
The Company's management believes that operating income, excluding charges, as well as "Normalized" earnings are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends, repayment of debt and further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The

Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and one-time events such as tax benefits and certain other items, is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance. Another purpose for which the Company uses "Normalized" earnings per share and free cash flow is as performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management and other employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
 
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL) today announced first quarter 2010 financial results, including net sales growth of 8.5 percent and normalized earnings per share of $0.25, a significant improvement over prior year quarter results. The company also reported 100 basis points in gross margin expansion and over $40 million in improved operating cash flow compared to the prior year quarter.
ATLANTA, April 30, 2010
"We are pleased to report a return to net sales growth across all our geographic regions, a significant inflection point from the sales trends of the last four quarters," said Mark Ketchum, Newell Rubbermaid's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our solid first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model, as we delivered impressive improvement in gross margin from product mix and productivity, and leveraged increased revenue to achieve significant EPS growth as well. We continue to invest strategically in our brands and in innovative new products to support ongoing sales growth. Looking forward, we are encouraged by early signs of improvement in the global economy and increased confidence on the part of our retail and industrial customers."
Net sales increased 8.5 percent to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Core sales improved 7.2 percent. The company estimates that 2 to 3 percent of the core sales increase reflects increased consumer demand while the remainder is attributable to selective customer inventory restocking and a timing shift in customer buying patterns from the second quarter to the first quarter in advance of an April SAP implementation at the Rubbermaid Consumer and Rubbermaid Commercial Products business units. Foreign currency translation contributed 2.5 percent to the company's net sales improvement, while the year over year impact of last year's product line exits reduced net sales by 1.2 percent.
Gross margin for the quarter was 36.1 percent, up 100 basis points from last year as productivity gains and improved product mix more than offset the impact of inflation during the quarter.
Excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $16.0 million in 2010 and $30.5 million in 2009, operating income was $146.1 million, or 11.2 percent of sales, in the first quarter compared to $111.3 million, or 9.2 percent of sales, in the prior year.
Normalized earnings were $0.25 per diluted share, compared to prior year results of $0.20 per diluted share. For the first quarter 2010, normalized diluted earnings per share exclude $0.04 for Project Acceleration restructuring costs, net of tax, and $0.02 of dilution related to the conversion feature of the convertible notes issued in March 2009 and the impact of associated hedge transactions. For the first quarter 2009, normalized earnings per share exclude $0.08 for Project
 
 
Acceleration restructuring costs, net of tax. (A reconciliation of the "as reported" results to "normalized" results is included below.)
Net income, as reported, was $58.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This compares to $33.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2009.
The company generated operating cash flow of $29.4 million during the first quarter, driven by increased earnings and working capital management. This compares to a use of $11.2 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $31.5 million in the first quarter, compared to $32.4 million last year.
A reconciliation of the first quarter 2010 and last year's results is as follows:
 
2010 Full Year Outlook
The company raised its guidance for 2010 net sales growth to a range of low to mid single digits versus earlier expectations of low single digit growth. Core sales are projected to increase in the low to mid single digits, offset by a one to two percent decline from the impact of 2009 product exits and a slightly negative impact from foreign currency. Gross margin is anticipated to improve 75 to 100 basis points.
The company increased its expectations for 2010 normalized earnings to $1.38 to $1.48 per diluted share, compared with previous expectations of $1.35 to $1.45 per diluted share.
Operating cash flow is projected to exceed $500 million for the full year, including approximately $70 to $100 million in restructuring cash payments. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $160 to $170 million.
