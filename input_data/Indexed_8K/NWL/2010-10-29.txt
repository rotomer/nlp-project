Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02, and the Exhibit attached to this Report, are furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Consequently, such items are not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Such items may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 29, 2010, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") reported its results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010. The Company's press release, dated October 29, 2010, and Additional Financial Information, is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The press release and Additional Financial Information contain non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G, a "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Operating and statistical measures and certain ratios and other statistical measures are not non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the definition, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided, as a part of the press release and Additional Financial Information, a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The Company has used certain financial measures that are included in the press release and Additional Financial Information both in presenting its results to stockholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these measures  including those that are "non-GAAP financial measures"  and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures:
 
 
The Company's management believes that operating income, excluding charges, as well as "Normalized" earnings are also useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's continuing operations. The Company's management believes that free cash flow, defined by the Company as cash generated from operations less capital expenditures, is useful to investors because it is an indication of amounts of cash flow that may be available for dividends, repayment of debt and further investment in future growth initiatives. The Company's management believes that adjusted sales, as reflected in the Currency Analysis included in Exhibit 99.1, is useful to investors

because it demonstrates the effect of foreign currency translation on reported sales. The Company's management believes that "Normalized" earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and one-time events such as losses related to the extinguishments of debt, tax benefits and certain other items, is useful to investors because it permits investors to better understand year-over-year changes in underlying operating performance. Another purpose for which the Company uses "Normalized" earnings per share and free cash flow is as performance goals that help determine the amount, if any, of cash bonuses for corporate management and other employees under the Company's management cash bonus plan.
While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
 
The information set forth under Item 2.02 above and in Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is also intended to be furnished under this Item 7.01 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL) today announced third quarter 2010 financial results, including normalized earnings per share of $0.42, a 10.5 percent improvement over prior year results, core sales growth of 5.7 percent and gross margin expansion of 70 basis points.
ATLANTA, October 29, 2010
"I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance," said Mark Ketchum, President and CEO. "We generated improved results in all key financial metrics. We grew core sales over five percentage points despite lingering economic headwinds, we continued to expand our gross margin and increased normalized earnings per share. I'm confident that these strong financial results provide compelling evidence that our strategy of investing behind consumer driven innovation and brand building is working to create long term value for our shareholders."
Net sales in the third quarter were $1.49 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent compared with the prior year. Core sales improved 5.7 percent. The year over year impact of last year's product line exits reduced net sales by 2.0 percent, and foreign currency translation had a negative 1.1 percent impact on sales.
Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1 percent, up 70 basis points from last year as productivity gains and improved product mix more than offset the impact of input cost inflation.
Operating income was $197.6 million, or 13.3 percent of sales, excluding $23.1 million of Project Acceleration restructuring costs and restructuring related costs incurred in connection with the European Transformation Plan. In 2009, operating income was $192.3 million, or 13.3 percent of sales, excluding Project Acceleration restructuring costs of $27.0 million.
Normalized earnings were $0.42 per diluted share compared to prior year normalized results of $0.38 per diluted share, driven primarily by sales growth, improved gross margin, reduced interest expense and a lower tax rate. For the third quarter 2010, normalized diluted earnings per share exclude $0.05 per diluted share for restructuring and restructuring related costs, net of tax; $0.04 per diluted share of dilution related to the conversion feature of the convertible notes issued in March 2009 and the impact of associated hedge transactions; $0.45 per diluted share in charges and other impacts associated with the Capital Structure Optimization Plan; and a benefit of $0.21 per diluted share reflecting the favorable resolution of a tax examination. For the third quarter 2009, normalized earnings per share exclude $0.07 per diluted share for Project Acceleration restructuring costs, net of tax, and $0.02 per diluted share of dilution related to the conversion feature of the convertible notes issued in March 2009 and the impact of associated hedge transactions. (A reconciliation of the "as reported" results to "normalized" results is included below.)
 
 
 
Net income, as reported, was $28.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the third quarter. This compares to $85.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the prior year.
The company generated operating cash flow of $194.5 million during the third quarter, compared to $327.7 million in the comparable period last year as the prior year reflected a significant reduction in working capital that did not repeat. Capital expenditures were $38.8 million in the third quarter compared to $37.0 million in the prior year.
Capital Structure Optimization Plan
During the quarter the company successfully initiated a series of transactions designed to optimize its capital structure, reduce interest expense and largely eliminate share dilution associated with its convertible notes. This Capital Structure Optimization Plan included the following components:
 
 
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of the third quarter 2010 and last year's results is as follows:
 
 
 
 
Nine Months Results
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased 3.2 percent to $4.29 billion, compared to $4.16 billion in the prior year. Core sales increased 4.6 percent for the nine months. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 0.3 percent, while the year over year impact of last year's product line exits lowered net sales by 1.7 percent.
Gross margin was 37.9 percent, a 130 basis point improvement versus the prior year. Productivity gains and improved product mix more than offset the effect of input cost inflation.
Normalized earnings were $1.18 per diluted share compared to $1.04 per diluted share in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, normalized earnings exclude the same items as those in the third quarter 2010 as well as a benefit of $0.01 per diluted share related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for the company's Venezuelan operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, normalized earnings excluded the same items as those in the third quarter 2009, as well as $0.02 per diluted share related to one-time items and other tax adjustments. (A reconciliation of the "as reported" results to "normalized" results is included below.)
Net income, as reported, was $217.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. This compares to $224.9 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the prior year.
The company generated operating cash flow of $377.9 million during the first nine months of 2010 compared to $415.7 million in the prior year, with the decline driven by the timing of working capital requirements. Capital expenditures were $108.1 million, compared to $107.7 million in the prior year.
A reconciliation of the first nine months 2010 and last year's results is as follows:
 
 
 
 
2010 Full Year Outlook
The company reaffirmed its guidance for full year 2010 results, including net sales growth in the low to mid single digit range and core sales growth in the mid single digits. The impact of 2009 product line exits is expected to be a negative one to two percent, and the impact from foreign currency translation is expected to be modestly negative.
Gross margin is expected to improve 75 to 100 basis points with the combination of productivity, mix and pricing more than offsetting the impact of input cost inflation.
The company reaffirmed its guidance for 2010 normalized earnings in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share, and stated its belief that results will likely be at the high end of the range.
Operating cash flow is expected to exceed $500 million for the full year, including approximately $70 to $100 million in restructuring cash payments. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $160 to $170 million.
A reconciliation of the 2010 earnings outlook is as follows:
