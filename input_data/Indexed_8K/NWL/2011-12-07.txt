Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 2, 2011, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") entered into a five-year credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets served as Syndication Agents, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets served as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners.
The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 2, 2016, and an aggregate commitment at any time outstanding of up to $800,000,000. The Company may from time to time request increases in the aggregate commitment to up to $1,250,000,000 upon the satisfaction of approval requirements. The Company may request extension of the maturity date of the facility (subject to lender approval) for additional one-year periods. Extensions of credit under the facility will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, backup liquidity to issue commercial paper. Under the facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The facility provides for the issuance of up to $100,000,000 of letters of credit for the account of the Company, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the facility. In addition to the committed portion of the facility, the Credit Agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders (in the lenders' discretion) of up to $500,000,000, which are not a utilization of the commitment. Subject to the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the facility at any time prior to termination of the facility.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. The covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement include certain affirmative and negative operational and financial covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on the Company's ability to incur certain liens, make fundamental changes to its business or engage in transactions with affiliates, limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by the Company's subsidiaries and a requirement that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital ratios, as defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the termination of the lenders' obligation to extend credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Currencies; Currency Equivalents
(a) At any time, any reference in the definition of the term "Agreed Foreign Currency" or in any other provision of this Agreement to the Currency of any particular nation means the lawful currency of such nation at such time whether or not the name of such Currency is the same as it was on the date hereof. Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 2.18(a), for purposes of determining (i) whether the amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit, together with all other Borrowings then outstanding or to be borrowed thereunder at the same time as such Borrowing, would exceed the total Commitments, (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of the Commitments, (iii) the Revolving Credit Exposure and (iv) the LC Exposure, the outstanding principal or undrawn face amount of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of Foreign Currency of such Borrowing determined as of the date of such Borrowing (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the definition of the term "Interest Period") or of such Letter of Credit determined as of the date of the issuance thereof, as the case may be.
(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing or Loan an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing or Loan is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest 1,000 units of such Foreign Currency).

provided
 
Participating Member State by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in euro or such Currency, such party shall be entitled to pay or repay such amount either in euro or in such Currency. If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in this Agreement with respect to an Agreed Foreign Currency of any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date on which such Currency becomes an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis effective as of and from the date on which such country becomes a Participating Member State; that, with respect to any Borrowing denominated in such Currency that is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect at the end of the Interest Period therefor. Without prejudice to the respective liabilities of the Loan Parties to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to the Loan Parties under or pursuant to this Agreement, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably specify in writing to the Company to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction or changeover to the euro in any country that becomes a Participating Member State after the date hereof.

A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the claim and the computation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by Loan Parties
(e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the applicable Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of such Loan Party to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the applicable Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

provided
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
 
requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the applicable Loan Party and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
(h) . Each party's obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

(a) . Each Loan Party shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be

due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement (including facility fees, payments required under Section 2.15, and payments required under Section 2.16 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.16, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise) or shall fail to pay any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when due, the unpaid portion of such Loan or reimbursement obligation shall, if such Loan or reimbursement obligation is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, in the case of any such Loan, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal or reimbursement obligation shall be payable on demand; and if any Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, in the case of any such Loan, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
(b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
(c) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
 
(d) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Presumptions of Payment
(e) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of Different Lending Office
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank shall have consented to such Eligible Assignee to the extent consent would be required under the terms of Section 10.04(b) in connection with an assignment to such Eligible Assignee (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other
Replacement of Lenders
provided
 
amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) (except to the extent allocable to (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans funded by it and (ii) its outstanding LC Exposure for which such Defaulting Lender has provided Cash Collateral to the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder);
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02), except that (i) the Commitment(s) of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended, or the maturity of any of its Loans may not be extended, the rate of interest on any of its Loans may not be reduced and the principal amount of any of its Loans may not be forgiven, in each case without the consent of such Defaulting Lender and (ii) any amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of all the Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than the other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;
(c) if any LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Company shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Company shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time) and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment.
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks only the Applicable Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
(iii) if the Company Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Applicable Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is Cash Collateralized;
 
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor Cash Collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or Cash Collateralized; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Banks shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or Cash Collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with Section 2.20(c), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.20(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, any Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank, shall have entered into arrangements with the Company or such Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Issuing Banks each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Competitive Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
SECTION 2.21. . (a) . Provided that no Default exists, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Company may from time to time request an increase in the Commitments by an amount such that, immediately after giving effect to such increase, the total Commitments hereunder shall not exceed $1,250,000,000; that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000. At the time of delivery of such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall be at least five Business Days after the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders and at least 30 days prior to the Maturity Date).
Increase in Commitments
Request for Increase
provided
(b) . Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to agree to increase its Commitment hereunder and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of each Lender.
Lender Elections to Increase
 
(c) . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the Company may also invite additional Persons which are Eligible Assignees that are not then Lenders to become Lenders; that the Commitment of each such Person shall equal to at least $25,000,000. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Lender participating in such increase (including each such Person) shall be subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank (such consent in each case not to be unreasonably withheld) to the extent consent would be required under the terms of Section 10.04(b) in connection with an assignment to such Lender or Person.
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders
provided

    and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
    as Administrative Agent for such Lenders
    (the "")
Administrative Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special New York counsel to Administrative Agent in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of December 2, 2011 (the "") among Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the ""), the Subsidiary Borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto (the "") and the Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same respective defined meanings when used herein.
Credit Agreement
Company
Lenders
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined an executed counterpart of the Credit Agreement. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement. We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except, to the extent set forth below, as to the Company) constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of, all of the parties thereto, that all signatories thereto have been duly authorized and that all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and qualifications:
(A) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Agreement to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.
(B) The enforceability of Section 10.03 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, wilful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
(C) Section 7.02(c) of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially modified.
(D) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender is located (other than New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) the last sentence of Sections 2.18(c) of the Credit Agreement and the fifth sentence of Section 10.04(c) of the Credit Agreement, (iii) Section 7.06 of the Credit Agreement, (iv) Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement, (v) the first sentence of Section 10.09(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sentence relates to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (vi) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 10.09(c) of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (vii) Section 10.17 of the Credit Agreement.
(E) We wish to point out with reference to obligations stated to be payable in a currency other than Dollars that (i) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency would be rendered in such other currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment and (ii) a judgment rendered by a Federal court sitting in the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in such other currency may be expressed in Dollars, but we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such Federal court would apply.
The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction.
This opinion letter is provided to you by us as special New York counsel to JPMCB pursuant to Section 4.01(c) of the Credit Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without our prior written consent in each instance.
