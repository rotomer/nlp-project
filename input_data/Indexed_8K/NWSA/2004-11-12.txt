ITEM 2.01 ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
 
On November 12, 2004, the reorganization of The News Corporation Limited, an Australian corporation ("TNCL") was effected in accordance with the Implementation Agreement (the "Implementation Agreement"), among TNCL, Carlholt Pty Ltd, an Australian corporation ("Carlholt"), and News Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("News Corporation"), which included, among other things, (i) the acquisition by Carholt, a wholly owned direct subsidiary of News Corporation, of all of the shares in TNCL, (ii) the cancellation of all the shares and options in TNCL, and in exchange existing TNCL shareholders and optionholders received shares and options in News Corporation, and (iii) the listing of News Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the secondary listing of News Corporation on the Australian Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. As a result of the transactions discussed in the preceding sentence, TNCL became a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of News Corporation. Holders of ordinary shares of TNCL ("Ordinary Shares") received one share of News Corporation Voting Common Stock for every two Ordinary Shares of TNCL held; holders of preferred limited voting shares of TNCL ("Preferred Shares") received one share of News Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock for every two Preferred Shares of TNCL held; holders of American Depository Shares ("ADSs") (each of which represents either four Ordinary Shares or four Preferred Shares) received two shares of News Corporation Voting Common Stock or two shares of News Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock (as the case may be) for each ADS held; and holders of options over Preferred Shares (granted under either the News Corporation Share Option Plan or Australian Executive Option Plan) received new options representing half as many options over shares of News Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock and the exercise price of these options is twice the exercise price of the options they replace.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the transaction is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
TNCL's Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, Ordinary ADSs and Preferred ADSs were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). In reliance on Rule 12g-3 of the Exchange Act, News Corporation Voting Common Stock and News Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock are deemed registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. TNCL is delisting its Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, Ordinary ADSs and Preferred ADSs from the NYSE and filing a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration under the Exchange Act of the Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, Ordinary ADSs and Preferred ADSs. In addition, TNCL is delisting the Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares from the Australian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the New Zealand Stock Exchange. On November 12, 2004, TNCL changed its name to News Holdings Limited. A Form 8-A pertaining to the registration under Section 12(b) of Class A Preferred Stock Purchase Rights and Class B Preferred Stock Purchase Rights pursuant to the Agreement dated November 8, 2004 among the Company and Computershare is also being filed today.

(b) Requests for Information. If the Corporation has reason to believe that the Ownership, or proposed Ownership, of shares of capital stock of the Corporation by any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee could, either by itself or when taken together with the Ownership of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation by any other Person, result in any Violation, such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee, upon request of the Corporation, shall promptly furnish to the Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with respect to citizenship, other Ownership interests and affiliations) as the Corporation may reasonably request to determine whether the Ownership of, or the exercise of any rights with respect to, shares of capital stock of the Corporation by such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee could result in any Violation.
 
(c) Rights of the Corporation. If (i) any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee from whom information is requested should fail to respond to such request pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5 within the period of time (including any applicable extension thereof) determined by the Board of Directors, or (ii) whether or not any stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee timely responds to any request for information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5, the Board of Directors shall conclude that effecting, permitting or honoring any Transfer or the Ownership of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, by any such stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee, could result in any Violation, or that it is in the interest of the Corporation to prevent or cure any such Violation or any situation which could result in any such Violation, or mitigate the effects of any such Violation or any situation that could result in any such Violation, then the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit any Transfer of record of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that involves a Transfer of such shares to, or Ownership of such shares by, any Disqualified Person, (B) refuse to honor any such Transfer of record effected or purported to have been effected, and in such case any such Transfer of record shall be deemed to have been void ab initio, (C) suspend those rights of stock ownership the exercise of which could result in any Violation, (D) redeem such shares in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 5, and/or (E) take all such other action as the Corporation may deem necessary or advisable in furtherance of the provisions of this Section 5, including, without limitation, exercising any and all appropriate remedies, at law or in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any Disqualified Person. Any such refusal of Transfer or suspension of rights pursuant to subclauses (A), (B) and (C) respectively, of the immediately preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has been received and the Board of Directors has determined that such Transfer, or the exercise of any such suspended rights, as the case may be, would not constitute a Violation.
 
(d) Redemption by the Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted pursuant to this Article IV creating any series of
 
Series Common Stock or any series of Preferred Stock, outstanding shares of Common Stock, Series Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall always be subject to redemption by the Corporation, by action of the Board of Directors, if in the judgment of the Board of Directors such action should be taken with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation of which any Disqualified Person is the stockholder, other Owner or Proposed Transferee. The terms and conditions of such redemption shall be as follows:
 
(1) the redemption price of the shares to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of such shares;
 
(2) the redemption price of such shares may be paid in cash, Redemption Securities or any combination thereof;
 
(3) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include selection first of the most recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other manner determined by the Board of Directors;
 
(4) at least 30 days' written notice of the Redemption Date shall be given to the record holders of the shares selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder); provided that the Redemption Date may be the date on which written notice shall be given to record holders if the cash or Redemption Securities necessary to effect the redemption shall have been deposited in trust for the benefit of such record holders and subject to immediate withdrawal by them upon surrender of the stock certificates for their shares to be redeemed;
 
(5) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including without limitation any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on stock of the same class or series as such shares), shall cease and terminate and the record holders of such shares shall thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash or Redemption Securities payable upon redemption; and
 
(6) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall determine.
 
(e) Legends. The Corporation shall, to the extent required by law, note on the certificates of its capital stock that the shares represented by such certificates are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.
 
 
SECTION 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock) relating to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock to elect additional directors, the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3), with the then-authorized number of directors being fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors.
 
The Board of Directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock Directors") or by holders of any series of Series Common Stock (the "Series Common Stock Directors")) shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Class I directors shall initially serve until the third annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office; Class II directors shall initially serve until the second annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office; and Class III directors shall initially serve until the first annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office. Commencing with the first annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, at each annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the directors of the class the term of which shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders and until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office. In case of any increase or decrease, from time to time, in the number of directors (other than Preferred Stock Directors and the Series Common Stock Directors), the number of directors in each class shall be apportioned as nearly equally as possible.
 
Subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
 
Except for such additional directors, if any, as are elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors ("Voting Stock"), voting together as a single class. At any time that there shall be three or fewer stockholders of record, directors may be removed with or without cause.
 
During any period when the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock have the right to elect additional directors, then upon commencement and for the duration of the period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said provisions, and (ii) each such additional director shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, unless such director's right to hold such office terminates earlier pursuant to said provisions, subject in all such cases to his or her earlier death,
 
disqualification, resignation or removal. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be reduced accordingly.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of outstanding shares of one or more series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or as a separate class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies, and other features of such directorship shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock or Series of Common Stock) applicable thereto.
 
SECTION 2. The election of directors need not be by written ballot.
 
SECTION 3. Advance notice of nominations for the election of directors shall be given in the manner and to the extent provided in the By-laws of the Corporation.
 
 
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, at any time that there shall be more than three stockholders of record, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or Series Common Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation (a) may be called by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors or as otherwise provided in the By-laws of the Corporation and (b) shall be called by the Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request of holders of record of not less than 20% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, proposing a proper matter for stockholder action under the DGCL at such special meeting, that (i) no such special meeting of stockholders shall be called pursuant to this clause (b) if the written request by such holders is received less than 135 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and (ii) any special meeting called pursuant to this clause (b) shall be held not later than 100 days following receipt of the written request by such holders, on such date and at such time and place as determined by the Board of Directors.

the By-laws of the Corporation.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII, the Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are subject to this reservation.
 
 
A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.
 
 
The Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.
 
This Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall become effective upon filing pursuant to the DGCL.

Exhibit 3.3
 
 
 
 
 
We, the undersigned, Arthur Siskind, Senior Executive Vice-President, and David F. Devoe, Senior Executive Vice-President, of News Corporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of Sections 103 and 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, do hereby make this Certificate of Designation and do hereby state and certify that pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors duly adopted the following resolutions:
 
RESOLVED, that, pursuant to Section 1(a) of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (which authorizes 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Preferred Stock") of which none have already been designated), the Board of Directors hereby fixes the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions, of a series of Preferred Stock;
 
RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of this Corporation in accordance with the provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and it hereby is created, and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as follows:
 
Section 1. . The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 9,000,000.
Designation and Amount
 
Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
 
(A) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the 1st day of March, June, September and December in
each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $0.10 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Class B Common Stock of the Corporation since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after November 8, 2004 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $0.10 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares
 
at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
 
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) directors.
 
(ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of directors shall be exercised unless the holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The
 
absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
 
(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (C)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
 
(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration
 
of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (C) to directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
 
(v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors.
 
(D) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
 
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
 
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not
 
(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock;
 
(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
 
(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares
 
Section 6. .
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
 
(A) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to $1000 per share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the
 
Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (C) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
 
(B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock.
 
(C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7. . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Consolidation, Merger, etc
 
Section 8. . The shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
No Redemption
 
Section 9. . The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any such series shall provide otherwise.
Ranking
 
Section 10. . At any time when any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
Amendment
 
Section 11. . Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
Fractional Shares
 
Section 12. . As used herein with respect to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90
th

the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. For purposes of the first annual meeting held after January 1, 2005, the Anniversary shall be deemed to be September 16, 2005. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (1) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected; (2) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment); and (3) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (aa) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (bb) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (cc) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (dd) whether either such stockholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of the Corporation's voting shares required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number of holders of the Corporation's voting shares to elect such nominee or nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a "Solicitation Notice"). The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation.
 
Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph of this Section 1(b) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the Corporation at least 55 days prior to the Anniversary, a stockholder's notice required by this By-law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10
th
day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation. Only persons nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1(b) shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1(b). Except as otherwise provided by law, the chair of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-laws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these By-laws, to declare that such defective proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(b),
 
unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1(b), to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(b), a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 1(b). The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 1(b) shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal or nomination at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal or nomination has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting, and nothing in this Section 1(b) shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

Section 1. .
Indemnification
 
Each person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of any other corporation or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in such person's official capacity or in any other capacity while holding such office, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, excise or other taxes assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be such a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors, and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
 
Section 2. .
Advancement of Expenses
 
The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by indemnitee in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that no such advancement of expenses shall be made except upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision or order from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this ARTICLE VII or otherwise.
 
Section 3. .
Enforcement
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this ARTICLE VII shall be contract rights.

If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL, and (b) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board, any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VII or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.
 
Section 4. .
Rights Non-Exclusive
 
The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE VII shall not be exclusive of any right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, By-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
 
Section 5. .
Insurance
 
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or loss under the DGCL.
 
Section 6. .
Indemnification by Other Enterprises
 
The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving as a director of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation or, at the request of the Corporation, of any other corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
 
Section 7. .
Repeal or Modification
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this ARTICLE VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

Indemnification of Other Persons
 
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant indemnification rights and rights to the advancement of expenses to any officer, employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provision of this ARTICLE VII and as permitted by the DGCL with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to directors.

Section 3. .
Reliance upon Books, Reports and Records
 
Each director, each member of any committee designated by the Board, and each officer of the Corporation shall, in the performance of his or her duties, to the fullest extent permitted by law
 
be protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account or other records of the Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or committees of the Board so designated, or by any other person as to matters which such director or committee member reasonably believes are within such other person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation.
 
Section 4. .
Fiscal Year

In applying any provision of these By-laws which requires that an act be done or not be done a specified number of days prior to an event or that an act be done during a period of a specified number of days prior to an event, calendar days shall be used, the day of the doing of the act shall be included, and the day of the event shall be excluded.
 
Section 6. Disbursements.
 
All checks or demands for money and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board may from time to time designate.
