In addition, within 15 days after the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), News America will be required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
 
On December 3, 2004, News America also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement relating to the New Notes with the Guarantors named therein and Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the initial purchaser. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
 
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee
 
 
Indenture
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized series (this series being the "Securities") of debt securities of News America Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("NAI" or the "Company"), issued under an Amended and Restated Indenture dated as of March 24, 1993, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 20, 1993, a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 28, 1993, a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 21, 1993, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 20, 1995, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 8, 1998, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1999, a Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2001, an Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2003, and a Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 12, 2004 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), among NAI, the Guarantors named therein (the "Guarantors") and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the indenture), which provides for the issuance by NAI from time to time of debt securities (the "Debt Securities") in one or more series, in which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"), and as provided in the Indenture. The terms of the Securities and Guarantee set forth in this certificate are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms of the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of those terms. The Securities are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the "Guarantee") by the Guarantors. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
 
 
Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. NAI may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Security Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. NAI or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar.
 
 
The Securities are not redeemable, provided, however, that the Securities may be redeemed at the option of NAI, in whole, but not in part, at 100% of principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date in the event that NAI has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that (i) NAI does not have sufficient funds to fulfill its obligations
 
under the Indenture and a Guarantor is required to make the payments on the Securities pursuant to the Guarantee, (ii) a Guarantor that is not a United States resident has or will become obligated to pay the Additional Amounts which are described in Section 1204 of the Indenture and (iii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Guarantor taking reasonable measures (including News Corporation causing any other Guarantor to make payments pursuant to the Guarantee) that require no material cost to News Corporation or any other Guarantor.
 
Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address.
 
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, NAI shall become immediately obligated to offer to purchase the Securities pursuant to Section 1301 of the Indenture upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event at a price equal to 101% of aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
 
 
The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of US$1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities for a period of 15 days before the selection of any Securities for redemption or of any Securities so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of the Security for all purposes.
 
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of Securities under the Indenture and the waiver of compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture at any time with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding (or, in case less than all of the several series of Debt Securities then outstanding are affected, of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each affected series). The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder hereof shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders hereof and of any Securities issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made hereon.
 
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Securities and (ii) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default applicable to the Securities, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
 
Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default in payment of the principal amount, premium, if any, or interest, in respect of the Securities when the same becomes due and payable subject, in the case of interest, to the grace period contained in the Indenture; (ii) failure by the Company or the Guarantors to perform any other covenant or warranty (other than a covenant included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of another series of Debt Securities), subject to notice and lapse of time; (iii) failure to pay at Stated Maturity (after the expiration of any grace period) certain indebtedness; (iv) certain events of acceleration prior to maturity of certain indebtedness; (v) certain final judgments which remain undischarged; or (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Securities becoming due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
 
Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (i) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
 
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by NAI or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with NAI or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
 
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of NAI shall not have any liability for any obligations of NAI under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Principal or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Acts).
 
 
THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee
 
 
 
Indenture
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized series (this series being the "Securities") of debt securities of News America Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("NAI" or the "Company"), issued under an Amended and Restated Indenture dated as of March 24, 1993, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 20, 1993, a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 28, 1993, a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 21, 1993, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 20, 1995, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 8, 1998, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1999, a Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2001, an Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2003, and a Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 12, 2004 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), among NAI, the Guarantors named therein (the "Guarantors") and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the indenture), which provides for the issuance by NAI from time to time of debt securities (the "Debt Securities") in one or more series, in which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "TIA"), and as provided in the Indenture. The terms of the Securities and Guarantee set forth in this certificate are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms of the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of those terms. The Securities are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the "Guarantee") by the Guarantors. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.
 
 
Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. NAI may appoint and change any Paying Agent or Security Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. NAI or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar.
 
 
The Securities are not redeemable, provided, however, that the Securities may be redeemed at the option of NAI, in whole, but not in part, at 100% of principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date in the event that NAI has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that (i) NAI does not have sufficient funds to fulfill its obligations
 
under the Indenture and a Guarantor is required to make the payments on the Securities pursuant to the Guarantee, (ii) a Guarantor that is not a United States resident has or will become obligated to pay the Additional Amounts which are described in Section 1204 of the Indenture and (iii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the Guarantor taking reasonable measures (including News Corporation causing any other Guarantor to make payments pursuant to the Guarantee) that require no material cost to News Corporation or any other Guarantor.
 
Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address.
 
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, NAI shall become immediately obligated to offer to purchase the Securities pursuant to Section 1301 of the Indenture upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event at a price equal to 101% of aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
 
 
The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of US$1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Security Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities for a period of 15 days before the selection of any Securities for redemption or of any Securities so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
 
The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of the Security for all purposes.
 
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of Securities under the Indenture and the waiver of compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture at any time with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding (or, in case less than all of the several series of Debt Securities then outstanding are affected, of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding of each affected series). The Indenture also permits the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder hereof shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders hereof and of any Securities issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made hereon.
 
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Securities and (ii) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default applicable to the Securities, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
 
Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default in payment of the principal amount, premium, if any, or interest, in respect of the Securities when the same becomes due and payable subject, in the case of interest, to the grace period contained in the Indenture; (ii) failure by the Company or the Guarantors to perform any other covenant or warranty (other than a covenant included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of another series of Debt Securities), subject to notice and lapse of time; (iii) failure to pay at Stated Maturity (after the expiration of any grace period) certain indebtedness; (iv) certain events of acceleration prior to maturity of certain indebtedness; (v) certain final judgments which remain undischarged; or (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Securities becoming due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
 
Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives reasonable indemnity or security. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (i) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
 
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by NAI or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with NAI or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
 
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of NAI shall not have any liability for any obligations of NAI under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
 
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Principal or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gifts to Minors Acts).
 
 
THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Issuer shall promptly commence the Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Exchange Offer to enable each Holder eligible and electing to exchange Registrable Securities (other than Private Exchange Securities) for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Issuer within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and is not a broker-dealer tendering Registrable Securities acquired directly from the Issuer for its own account, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements or understandings with any Person to participate in the Exchange Offer for the purpose of distributing (within the meaning of the Securities Act) the Exchange Securities) to transfer such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and under state securities or blue sky laws.

(vi) otherwise comply in all respects with all applicable laws relating to the Exchange Offer.
 
If, prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Initial Purchaser holds any Securities acquired by it and having the status of an unsold allotment in the initial distribution, the Issuer upon the request of the Initial Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities in the Exchange Offer, issue and deliver to the Initial Purchaser in exchange (the "") for the Securities held by the Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Issuer that are identical (except that such securities shall bear appropriate transfer restrictions) to the Exchange Securities (the "").

The Indenture or such indenture shall provide that the Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities and the Securities shall vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities or the Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a separate class on any matter. The Private Exchange Securities shall be of the same series as, and the Issuer shall use its best efforts to have the Private Exchange Securities bear the same CUSIP number as, the Exchange Securities.
 
As soon as practicable after the close of the Exchange Offer and/or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Issuer shall:
 
(i) accept for exchange all Securities or portions thereof tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer;
 
(ii) accept for exchange all Securities duly tendered pursuant to the Private Exchange; and
 
(iii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all Securities or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the Issuer, and issue, and cause the Trustee under the Indenture to promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder, a new Exchange Security or Private Exchange Security, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the Securities surrendered by such Holder and accepted for exchange.
 
To the extent not prohibited by any law or applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC, the Issuer shall use its best efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above, and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable laws in connection with the Exchange Offer.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, joint or several, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), covering Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, joint or several, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any court or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the prior written consent of the Issuer; and
 
(iii) against any and all expenses whatsoever, as incurred (including reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel chosen by the Initial Purchaser, such Holder, such Participating Broker-Dealer or any underwriter (except to the extent otherwise expressly
 
provided in Section 4(c) hereof)), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any court or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this Section 4(a);
 
, , that this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission (i) made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished in writing to the Issuer or the Guarantors by the Initial Purchaser, such Holder, such Participating Broker-Dealer or any underwriter with respect to the Initial Purchaser, Holder, Participating Broker-Dealer or underwriter, as the case may be, expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or (ii) contained in any preliminary prospectus if the Initial Purchaser, such Holder, such Participating Broker-Dealer or such underwriter failed to send or deliver a copy of the Prospectus (in the form it was first provided to such parties for confirmation of sales or as amended or supplemented pursuant to Section 3(i) prior to such confirmation of sales) to the Person asserting such losses, claims, damages or liabilities on or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of any sale of securities covered thereby to such Person in any case where such delivery is required by the Securities Act and a court of competent jurisdiction in a judgment not subject to appeal or final review shall have determined that such Prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or omission. Any amounts advanced by the Issuer to an indemnified party pursuant to this Section 4 as a result of such losses shall be returned to the Issuer if it shall be finally determined by such a court in a judgment not subject to appeal or final review that such indemnified party was not entitled to indemnification by the Issuer.

(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, each underwriter who participates in an offering of Registrable Securities and the other selling Holders and each of their respective directors, officers (including each officer of the Issuer who signed the Registration Statement), employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, any underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever described in the indemnity contained in Section 4(a) hereof, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or in any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer or the Guarantors by such selling Holder with respect to such Holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any supplement thereto), or in any such Prospectus (or any amendment thereto); , , that, in the case of the Shelf Registration Statement, no such Holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale or other disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.

(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such
 
indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 4(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Initial Purchaser, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 4(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Issuer. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties defendant in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them which are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with anyone action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its prior written consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
 
(e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances under which any of the indemnity provisions set forth in this Section 4 is for any reason held to be unavailable to the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Issuer and the Holders shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement incurred by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchaser, the Holders and the Participating Broker-Dealers; , , that no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person that was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. As between the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Holders, such parties shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Holder of Registrable Securities, the Participating Broker-Dealer or the Initial Purchaser, as the case may be, on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
provided
however
 
The relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holder of Registrable Securities, the Participating Broker-Dealer or the Initial Purchaser, as the case may be, on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer, or the Guarantors, or by the Holder of Registrable Securities, the Participating Broker-Dealer or the Initial Purchaser, as the case may be, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Holders of the Registrable Securities and the Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 4.
 
For purposes of this Section 4, each affiliate of the Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director, officer, employee, agent and Person, if any, who controls a Holder of Registrable Securities, the Initial Purchaser or a Participating Broker-Dealer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same fights to contribution as such other Person, and each member or director of the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, each officer of the Issuer who signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Issuer or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be.
 
5. . No Holder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. The Issuer
Participation in Underwritten Registrations
 
shall be under no obligation to compensate any Holder for lost income, interest or other opportunity foregone, or other liability incurred, as a result of the Issuer's decision to exclude such Holder from any underwritten registration if such Holder has not complied with the provisions of this Section 5 in all material respects following 5 business days' written notice of noncompliance and the Issuer's decision to exclude such Holder.
 
6. . The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell the securities covered by such Shelf Registration in an underwritten offering. In any such underwritten offering, the underwriter or underwriters and manager or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities included in such offering; , , that such underwriters and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer.
