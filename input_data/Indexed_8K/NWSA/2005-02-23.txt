Exhibit 99.1
 
 
NEW YORK, NY, February 23, 2005News Corporation (NYSE: NWS, NWS.A; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) today announced that a hearing, originally scheduled to be held in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on March 1, 2005, has been postponed. The purpose of the hearing was to rule on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting completion of News Corporation's previously announced exchange offer for outstanding shares of Fox Entertainment Group, Inc.'s Class A common stock (NYSE: FOX). The date of any rescheduled hearing has yet to be determined, but News Corporation expects that any such hearing would be held in mid-March.
 
The exchange offer is currently set to expire at midnight, New York City time, March 4, 2005. Although News Corporation is not currently extending the expiration date of the exchange offer, News Corporation expects to extend the expiration date to a date following any rescheduled hearing.
 
Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was brought in connection with a previously filed purported class action lawsuit on behalf of Fox stockholders other than News Corporation. News Corporation believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest such allegations.
