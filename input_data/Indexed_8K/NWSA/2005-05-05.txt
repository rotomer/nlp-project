ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.
 
On May 3, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of News Corporation (the "Company") approved the acceleration of vesting of unvested out-of-the-money stock options granted under the Company's 2004 Stock Option Plan. The affected options are those with exercise prices greater than A$19.74 per share, which was the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock (as traded on the Australian Stock Exchange in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests) on May 2, 2005. Prior to the Company's reorganization in the United States, stock options were granted to employees with Australian dollar exercise prices. As a result of this action, the vesting of approximately 19,862,000 previously unvested stock options was accelerated and are now immediately exercisable. None of the unvested stock options held by directors, some of whom have options with exercise prices in excess of A$19.74, were accelerated.
 
The Compensation Committee's decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was in anticipation of compensation expense to be recorded subsequent to the effective date of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), ("SFAS 123R") on July 1, 2005. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize the grant-date fair value of stock options issued to employees as an expense in the income statement, and as of the effective date will require the Company to recognize the compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions, including stock options. In addition, the Compensation Committee considered that because these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value they were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention, and it believed that the acceleration would have a positive effect on employee morale. The future compensation expense to be recorded upon adoption of SFAS 123R that is eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options is approximately $100 million ($65 million net of tax) of which $58 million ($38 million net of tax) and $42 million ($27 million net of tax) will be realized in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, respectively.
