ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On December 22, 2006, News Corporation (the "Company") announced that it had signed a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty"). Under the terms of the transaction, Liberty will exchange its entire 16.3 percent economic position (324.6 million shares and 188 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively) for 100% of a News Corporation subsidiary ("Splitco"), whose holdings will consist of a 38.4 percent interest (470.4 million shares) in The DIRECTV Group, Inc. ("DTV"), three of the Company's Regional Sports Networks (FSN Northwest, FSN Pittsburgh and FSN Rocky Mountain (the "RSNs")) and $550 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the closing date net working capital of the RSNs as provided in the Share Exchange Agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, regulatory approvals, the receipt of a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's Class B common stock, other than the shares owned by Liberty, in accordance with the Australian Stock Exchange listing rules, approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's Class B common stock, other than the shares owned by the Murdoch Interests and Liberty and the absence of a material adverse effect on Splitco. If approved the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of calendar 2007. The Share Exchange Agreement provides that, upon termination under specified circumstances, including upon the failure to obtain the required shareholder vote under circumstances in which the votes associated with the shares of Class B common stock held by each of the Murdoch Interests and Liberty are not counted in determining whether such vote has been achieved, the Company would be required to pay Liberty a termination fee of $100 million. The Share Exchange Agreement provides for the payment of a $300 million termination fee under other specified circumstances, including a change in the Company Board of Directors' recommendation of the transaction. The Company has agreed to provide certain services to the RSNs after the closing and to certain restrictions on participating in a competing business in the territories of the RSNs. The Company has also agreed to certain restrictions after closing on participating in a business that provides direct-to-home delivery of video services by satellite in North or South America where such business was operated by DTV prior to the closing of the transaction. Each of the Company and Liberty has generally agreed to indemnify the other for breaches of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under the Share Exchange Agreement, subject to certain limitations. The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Share Exchange Agreement, a tax matters agreement between the parties and the Company's press release relating to the transaction, which are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 99.1, respectively, to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.

The final, binding and conclusive Net Working Capital Statement based either upon agreement or deemed agreement by Parent and LMC or the written determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this Section 3.9.3, will be the "Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement." If any party fails to submit a statement regarding any Disputed Item submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within the time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or otherwise fails to give the Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested, then the Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by Parent and LMC. 3.9.4 If the amount of Net Working Capital on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (the "Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount"), Parent shall pay to Splitco an amount in cash equal to the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount.

If the amount of Net Working Capital on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement is equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital, no payment shall be required. 3.9.5 All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.9 will (i) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on which Parent and LMC agree or are deemed to have agreed to, or the Neutral Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement, and (ii) will bear interest from the Closing Date through the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 6.4. Proxy Statement. 6.4.1 Within forty-five (45) days of the signing of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with each of the SEC and the ASX a proxy statement in preliminary form 44
(together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Parent Stockholders' Meeting. Parent shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that the Parent stockholders approve the Exchange (the "Parent Recommendation"); provided that prior to the approval of the Exchange by Parent's stockholders in accordance with this Agreement the Board of Directors of Parent may fail to make or withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to LMC its recommendation that the stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement (a "Parent Change in Recommendation"), if, and only if, the Board of Directors of Parent has determined, in its good faith judgment and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fulfillment of its fiduciary duties to Parent's stockholders under applicable Law; provided that a Parent Change in Recommendation shall not relieve Parent of its obligations pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC and the ASX with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall promptly notify LMC upon the receipt of any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or the ASX or their respective staff or any request from the SEC or the ASX or their respective staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, shall consult with LMC prior to responding to any such comments or request or filing any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide LMC with copies of all correspondence between Parent and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and the ASX and their respective staff, on the other hand. In addition to the Parent Stockholder Approval required by Law, the parties have agreed as a matter of contract that the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy by holders of Parent Class B Shares other than LMC, the Stockholders and any of their respective Associates, and the Murdoch Interests (the "Disinterested Stockholder Approval" and, together with the Parent Stockholder Approval, the "Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval") is required to approve the Exchange. Parent represents and warrants that (i) none of the information with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement or incorporated by reference therein will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the ASX, except for any such failures to comply as to form which result from any actions or omissions of LMC or any person authorized to act on its behalf, and will include, or be accompanied by, a report from Grant Samuel & Associates as to the fairness and reasonableness of the Exchange, which is qualified as an independent expert for these purposes under the ASX Listing Rules and applicable Law (the "Independent Expert Report"). Parent will provide LMC with drafts of the Independent Expert 45
Report received by Parent to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to the extent that Australian counsel to Parent has advised Parent that such action will not compromise the independence of such expert. LMC represents and warrants that none of the information with respect to LMC or its Subsidiaries supplied by LMC or any person authorized to act on its behalf for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or incorporated by reference therein will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 6.4.2 Parent and LMC shall cooperate and consult with each other in preparation of the Proxy Statement and any other documents or reports to be disseminated to holders of Parent Class B Common Stock primarily in connection with such holders' consideration of the Exchange (other than, except, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any factual matters contained in such report, the Independent Expert Report). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, LMC will use reasonable best efforts to furnish to Parent the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the ASX to be set forth or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing and mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the ASX with respect thereto, Parent shall provide LMC an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response. 6.4.3 As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC and the ASX, Parent shall mail the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Class B Common Stock as of the record date established for the Parent Stockholders' Meeting. If at any time prior to the Parent Stockholders' Meeting any event, occurrence or circumstance relating to the Parent, LMC or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or LMC, respectively, which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act or any applicable rule or regulation promulgated by the ASX, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto. Each of LMC and Parent agrees to correct any information provided by it for use or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. Parent will be solely responsible for all filing fees, costs and expenses relating to the preparation of the Proxy Statement and matters related to the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Section 6.5. Parent Stockholders' Meeting. Unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Parent shall, acting through its Board of Directors, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Class B Common Stock in 46
accordance with the Listing Rules of the ASX and any other applicable Laws, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Exchange (the "Parent Stockholders' Meeting"). Except as required by any Governmental Authority, and for matters to which LMC shall have provided its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the only matters Parent shall propose to be acted on by the holders of Parent Class B Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting shall be the approval of the Exchange. In connection with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite quorum at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting and to obtain the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval, including by soliciting from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Exchange, provided that Parent shall have no obligation to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Exchange from and after the date upon which there shall have been a Parent Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.4.1; provided, however, Parent shall continue to be obligated to convene and hold the Parent Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Section 6.6. Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings. 6.6.1 The parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the Transactions and to cause the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an Action by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions; and (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the Exchange, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed. 6.6.2 Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is executed) make its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions. 6.6.3 LMC and Parent shall cooperate to prepare such applications as may be necessary for submission to the FCC in order to obtain the FCC Consent (the "FCC Applications"). LMC and Parent shall promptly (in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is executed) file the FCC Applications with the FCC, and the parties shall diligently take, or cooperate in the taking of, all necessary, desirable and proper actions, and provide any additional information, reasonably required or requested by the FCC. Each of LMC and Parent agrees not to, and shall not 47
permit any of its respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede receipt of the FCC Consent. 6.6.4 Each of LMC and Parent shall give (or shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and each of LMC and Parent shall use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by Sections 6.6.1, 6.6.2 and 6.6.3 above, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate Transactions. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. No party hereto shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, submissions, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. 6.6.5 If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or any Communications Regulation or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or Communications Regulation, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Authority or private party may have to such transactions under such law so as to permit consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance of the parties' obligations under this Section 6.6, LMC and Parent shall be required to (and, to the extent required by any Governmental Authority, shall cause their respective current and future Subsidiaries to), propose, negotiate, commit to and enter into one or more settlements, undertakings, conditions, consent decrees, stipulations and other agreements with or to one or more Governmental Authorities (each, a "Settlement") in connection with the Transactions (including obtaining the requisite consent of such Governmental Authorities), including one or more Settlements that require LMC or Parent to restructure the operations of, or sell or otherwise divest or dispose of, its assets and/or the assets of its current and future Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (i) neither LMC nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take (or commit to take) any of the foregoing actions, or any other action contemplated by this Section 6.6, (A) if any such actions would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of LMC and its Subsidiaries or any of their cable, television (including video or electronic home shopping) or satellite businesses, or (B) if the Board of Directors of LMC determines, in good faith, that the taking of such actions would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Splitco (without giving effect, for purposes of this Section 6.6.5, to the exception contained in clause (i) of 48
the second sentence of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" relating to the performance of this Agreement), (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take (or commit to take) any of the foregoing actions or any other action contemplated by this Section 6.6, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines, in good faith, that the taking of such actions would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Splitco (without giving effect, for purposes of this Section 6.6.5, to the exception contained in clause (i) of the second sentence of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" relating to the performance of this Agreement), without the prior written consent of LMC, and (iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take (or commit to take) any of the foregoing actions, or any other action contemplated by this Section 6.6, if any such actions would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any of their cable programming or television businesses. Section 6.7. Further Assurances. 6.7.1 Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be reasonably required to consummate the Transactions.

Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating to the Transferred Business; provided, however, that LMC 53
acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by Parent or its Representatives concerning Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than information relating to the Transferred Business) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing. Parent agrees to hold all Proprietary Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) in its possession as of the Closing Date confidential and to refrain from using such Proprietary Information for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent may use such Proprietary Information to the extent reasonably necessary for purposes of preparing and filing Tax Returns, corresponding with tax authorities, preparing accounting records, and in connection with any litigation, including, without limitation, litigation arising out of, relating to or resulting from the Transactions or the subject matter of such Proprietary Information. 6.9.2 LMC acknowledges and agrees that Parent may from time to time, subsequent to the consummation of the Transactions require access to or copies of the business records of Splitco or Transferred Subsidiaries to the extent relating to the operations of the Transferred Business prior to the Closing and LMC agrees that upon reasonable prior notice from Parent it will, during normal business hours, provide or cause to be provided to Parent, at Parent's option, access to or copies of such records. Parent hereby agrees to hold any Proprietary Information so provided in confidence; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent may use such Proprietary Information to the extent reasonably necessary for purposes of preparing and filing Tax Returns, corresponding with tax authorities, preparing accounting records, and in connection with any litigation, including, without limitation, litigation arising out of, relating to or resulting from the Transactions or the subject matter of such Proprietary Information. 6.9.3 Parent recognizes that, after the Closing, it may have documents, books, records, work papers and information, whether in written, magnetic, electronic or optical form (collectively, "Records") which relate to the Transferred Business with respect to the period or matters arising prior to the Closing, including Records pertaining to the assets and Liabilities related to the Transferred Business and Splitco's or the Transferred Subsidiaries' respective employees, assets and liabilities (the "Business Records") or other Records relating to the Transferred Business. Parent recognizes that LMC, the Stockholders or their respective Affiliates may need access to such Business Records and other Records after the Closing. Upon LMC's, a Stockholder's or Splitco's reasonable request Parent shall provide LMC, the Stockholders or Splitco and their respective Representatives access to, and the right to photocopy (at LMC's, the Stockholders' or Splitco's expense), during normal business hours on reasonable advance notice, such reasonably requested Records. For a period of five (5) years following the Closing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain all such Records or, at Parent's discretion or at LMC's, the Stockholders' or Splitco's reasonable request (at LMC's, the Stockholders' or Splitco's expense), transfer any such Records to LMC, the Stockholders or Splitco. 54
6.9.4 Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, from and after the Closing, Records pertaining to Taxes shall be governed solely by the Tax Matters Agreement. Section 6.10. Employee Matters. 6.10.1 Section 1.1 of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the name of each Transferred Employee, along with such employee's job title and reporting position, current salary and incentive bonus opportunities, and years of service, and designating such employee's status as exempt or non-exempt under the FLSA, whether such employee is full-time or part-time. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall update Section 1.1 of the Parent Disclosure Letter. 6.10.2 LMC acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee, including any such employee on approved leave of absence (whether family leave, workers' maternity or parental leave, workers' compensation, short-term and long-term disability, medical leave or otherwise) shall be employed in a substantially comparable position to the position in which such Transferred Employee was employed immediately prior to Closing Date. As of and for no less than one year following the Closing, LMC shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Transferred Employees who remain employed with LMC and its Affiliates with the same rate of base salary and wages and commissions and with employee benefit and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of LMC and its Affiliates. Any Transferred Employee who became entitled to short-term or long-term disability benefits under the applicable Employee Benefit Plans (the "Seller Disability Plans") prior to Closing shall be entitled to continue to receive such benefits under the terms of the Seller Disability Plans until his or her return to active employment, so long as such benefits are payable pursuant to third-party insurance coverage. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the insurance policies underlying the Seller Disability Plans to provide for such payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, LMC and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to keep any Transferred Employee employed for any period of time following the Closing, provided that if the employment of any Transferred Employee is terminated by LMC or its Affiliates during the 12-month period beginning on the Closing Date, LMC or its Affiliates shall pay to such terminated employee severance payments that are no less favorable than those provided under the Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent and its Affiliates shall cause the Employment Agreements and, to the extent necessary, any talent Contract identified on Sections 4.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, to be assigned to the appropriate Transferred Subsidiary prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the provisions of the employment agreement between Mark Shuken ("Shuken") and Fox Cable Networks Services, LLC, dated as of July 16, 2006 (the "Shuken Agreement"), during the period between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Parent agrees to allow (and to cause its Affiliates to allow) Shuken to discuss terms of potential 55
employment with LMC and its Affiliates, and to waive (and cause its Affiliates to waive) any restrictions in the Employment Agreement or any other agreement that would prevent Shuken from accepting employment with LMC or its Affiliates as of the Closing. Following the Closing, LMC shall assume and honor and/or shall cause its Affiliates to assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all Employment Agreements, and take all actions necessary to update such Employment Agreements to reflect such assumption, and Parent and Parent Group shall cease to have any further obligations under the Employment Agreements as of the Closing Date. Parent shall take all actions necessary such that following the Closing, the LMC Indemnitees, as applicable, shall have no liabilities with respect to any Employee Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plans, arrangements or agreements sponsored or contributed to by Parent Group other than the Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plans and the Employment Agreements. For purposes of all plans, programs or arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by LMC or its Affiliates in which the Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate, LMC shall cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service of each Transferred Employee with Parent, the Parent Entities or any of their Subsidiaries as service rendered to LMC for purposes of eligibility and vesting for all purposes and levels of benefits for purposes of severance and vacation, except to the extent such treatment would result in the duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. From and after the Closing, LMC and its Affiliates shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions, limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of LMC or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such condition would have been covered, or limitation or waiting period would not have applied, with respect to such Transferred Employee (or dependent) under the terms of the Employee Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) give each Transferred Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing (or the transition from Parent's plans to LMC's plans) occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Closing (or such later transition date). LMC or its Affiliates shall not provide financial incentive to any Transferred Employee to elect continued group health plan coverage under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code (or any similar state Law) with respect to plans maintained by Parent and its Affiliates, except to the extent LMC or its Affiliates directly or indirectly pay for such continued group health plan coverage for all Transferred Employees, whether pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement or otherwise. 6.10.3 Effective as of the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall cause each Transferred Employee to be fully vested in his or her accrued benefit under the savings plan in which such Transferred Employee participates immediately prior to Closing. 6.10.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plan, or shall limit the right of LMC, Splitco, the 56
Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plan following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other than Parent makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plan even though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory effect. Parent acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained in this Section 6.10 with respect to the Transferred Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant in any Subsidiary Employee Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with LMC, Splitco, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates. Section 6.11. Intercompany Services and Accounts. Except for the Ancillary Agreements, and except as set forth in Section 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, all Contracts pursuant to which any goods, services, materials or supplies have at any time been provided (i) by any RSN Subsidiary, on the one hand, to Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the RSN Subsidiaries), on the other hand, or (ii) by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the RSN Subsidiaries), on the one hand, to any RSN Subsidiary, on the other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at or before the Closing the written release and waiver from all appropriate Persons of any Encumbrances arising therefrom. Without derogating from the Parent's rights to withdraw cash from the RSN Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.2.10, prior to the Closing, all intercompany receivables or payables and loans then existing between Parent and its Affiliates (other than the RSN Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the RSN Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be settled by way of capital contribution, dividend or otherwise and all intercompany arrangements shall be terminated, except for those arrangements contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements or as expressly set forth in Section 6.11 of the Parent Disclosure Letter. Section 6.12. Cooperation with Respect to Financial Reporting. Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, each of Parent, on the one hand, and LMC, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with the other (at the other's expense) in connection with the other's preparation of historical financial statements of, or including, the Transferred Business as required for the other's filings under the Exchange Act following the Closing. Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, LMC shall, and shall cause Splitco to, (i) reasonably cooperate with Parent (at Parent's expense) in connection with Parent's preparation of pro forma and historical financial statements of the Transferred Business as may be required for Parent's filings under the Exchange Act following the Closing and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause DTV to reasonably cooperate with Parent (at Parent's expense) in connection with Parent's preparation of Parent's financial statements as may be required for Parent's filings under the Exchange Act following the Closing. Section 6.13. No Solicitation. 57
6.13.1 Parent and its Affiliates have ceased all, and, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates nor any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants, advisors, accountants or agents ("Representatives") to, (A) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including, in each case, by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or any indication of interest in, any acquisition by any third party of all or a substantial portion of the assets of any Transferred Subsidiary, any acquisition by any third party of any securities or other ownership interests of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or any acquisition of all or a portion of the DTV Shares (any such proposal, offer or indication of interest, a "Parent Acquisition Proposal"), (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or provide access to its properties, books and records or any non-public information or data to, any third party that has made, or to Parent's Knowledge, is considering making a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any Representatives thereof, (C) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, option agreement, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or (D) propose publicly or agree to any of the foregoing relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. 6.13.2 Parent will, and will take such lawful action solely in its capacity as a stockholder of DTV as may be reasonable to cause DTV and each of its Affiliates to, cease any ongoing, and not initiate any new, activities, directly or indirectly, through any Representative or otherwise, to solicit, initiate or encourage inquiries or submission of proposals or offers from any Person relating to (A) any sale or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the assets of DTV or its Affiliates or all or any substantial portion of the equity interests in DTV or its Affiliates or (B) any business combination involving DTV or any of its Affiliates, whether by merger, consolidation, tender offer or otherwise (any of the foregoing, an "Extraordinary Transaction") or to participate in any negotiation regarding, or furnishing to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with or assist in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.13.2 shall prohibit (or require Parent to prohibit) any director of DTV from exercising (solely in his or her capacity as a director of DTV) fiduciary duties to DTV or its shareholders (other than Parent) under applicable Law; 6.13.3 From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, Parent will (A) vote all voting shares of DTV or of any other Person held by Parent and any Affiliate of Parent against any Extraordinary Transaction that is presented or proposed to them at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing or termination of this Agreement, (B) not solicit proxies or become a "participant" in a "solicitation" with respect to the shares of capital stock of DTV (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) in opposition to or 58
in competition with the consummation of the Exchange or otherwise encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action which would compete with or materially impede, interfere with, adversely effect or tend to discourage or inhibit the timely consummation of the Exchange and (C) in the event of a tender offer for all or a portion of the outstanding shares of capital stock of DTV, not tender any DTV Shares in such tender offer and publicly announce, within 5 days of the announcement of such tender offer, Parent's intention not to tender any DTV Shares in such tender offer; provided, however that, in the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent or LMC pursuant to Section 9.1.6 or 9.1.7 or by LMC pursuant to Section 9.1.9, Parent's obligations under clauses (A), (B) and (C) of this sentence shall continue until the date that is six (6) months from the date of such termination, and, solely with respect to any transaction in respect of at least a majority of DTV's outstanding shares or all or substantially all of DTV's assets with respect to which a bona fide written proposal was publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to such termination, until the date that is twelve (12) months from the date of such termination. Parent will notify LMC promptly if any inquiries or proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, DTV or any of its Affiliates, in each case in connection with any Extraordinary Transaction. 6.13.4 LMC and its Affiliates have ceased all, and from the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, LMC shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates nor any of its Representatives to, (A) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including, in each case, by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or any indication of interest in, any acquisition by any third party of all or a portion of the LMC Parent Shares (any such proposal, offer or indication of interest, a "L Acquisition Proposal"), (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an L Acquisition Proposal, or provide access to its properties, books and records or any non-public information or data to, any third party that has made, or to LMC's Knowledge, is considering making an L Acquisition Proposal or any Representatives thereof, (C) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, option agreement, acquisition agreement or other agreement relating to an L Acquisition Proposal or (D) propose publicly or agree to any of the foregoing relating to an L Acquisition Proposal. Section 6.14. DTV Charter Restrictions. From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, neither LMC nor Parent shall, and each shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, propose to the Board of Directors of DTV, nor enter into any discussion with the Board of Directors of DTV regarding, any amendment to the DTV certificate of incorporation or bylaws. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any amendment to DTV's certificate of incorporation is proposed by DTV for approval of DTV's stockholders, Parent will publicly state its intention to vote against, and 59
cause all DTV Shares beneficially owned by Parent to be voted against any such amendment, unless LMC has consented to Parent voting in favor of such amendment Section 6.15. Certain Tax Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly provided in the Tax Matters Agreement, as set forth in Sections 4.20, 7.2.4, 7.2.5, 7.3.5, 7.3.6 or this 6.15, or as set forth in Sections 4.12 or 6.10 (including any indemnities related to Sections 4.12 or 6.10), the parties' sole and exclusive representations, warranties, agreements or other obligations (including indemnities) with respect to Tax matters (interpreted in its broadest sense), including the Tax consequences of the Transactions, shall be as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, and in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of the Tax Matters Agreement, the applicable provision of the Tax Matters Agreement shall govern. Section 6.16. Ancillary Agreements. Each of Parent and LMC shall, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates to, at or prior to the Closing, duly execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Tax Matters Agreement which shall be executed and delivered concurrently with this Agreement) to which it is to become a party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Section 6.17. Pledged Shares. Prior to or at the Closing, LMC shall unwind or terminate any variable forward OTC contracts to which any or all of the Pledged Shares are subject or substitute other securities, property or assets for the Pledged Shares under any such contracts, such that, at the Closing all of the Pledged Shares shall be delivered to Parent pursuant to Section 3.1; provided, that, nothing in this Section 6.17 shall require LMC to terminate or unwind such contracts; provided further, that, nothing in this Section 6.17 shall derogate from LMC's obligation to deliver the LMC Parent Shares in accordance with Section 3.1.

Notwithstanding Section 8.1.1, any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to Section 8.1.1 or 8.1.2 if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time. Section 8.2. Indemnification. 8.2.1 Provided that the Closing shall have occurred, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2.2, Parent hereby agrees to indemnify each LMC Indemnitee against and agrees to hold each of them harmless (without duplication) from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any LMC Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from (i) any representation or warranty of Parent contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.20) not being true and correct (which representations and warranties (except those made as of a specified date) shall be deemed to have been made again as of the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 8.2.1) or (ii) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent. 8.2.2 No indemnification by Parent shall be due and payable under Section 8.2.1 in respect of any Parent Basket Breach unless and until the cumulative amount of all Damages arising out of or resulting from all such Parent Basket Breaches exceeds the Parent Basket Amount, whereupon Parent will be obligated to indemnify the LMC Indemnitees for the cumulative amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the LMC Indemnitees in excess of the Parent Basket Amount, and only to the extent of such excess. Parent shall not be obligated to indemnify the LMC Indemnitees for Damages arising out of or resulting from all Parent Basket Breaches under this Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of the Maximum Amount; provided that the limitation on Parent's obligations set forth in this sentence shall not apply to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.12. The limitations on indemnification set forth in this Section 8.2.2 shall not be applicable to (x) any Parent Basket Exception Breach (and the LMC Indemnitees will be entitled to indemnification with respect to any Parent Basket Exception Breach without regard to any Parent Basket Amount or any Maximum Amount) and (y) any claim based upon fraud or knowing misrepresentation. For purposes of determining the amount of Damages arising from any Parent Basket Breach (but not for purposes of determining 64
whether any such Parent Basket Breach has occurred), the representations and warranties shall be read without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the words "material" or "materially") or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein. 8.2.3 Provided that the Closing shall have occurred, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2.4, LMC hereby agrees to indemnify each Parent Indemnitee against and agrees to hold each of them harmless (without duplication) from any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any Parent Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from (i) any representation or warranty of LMC contained in this Agreement not being true and correct (which representations and warranties (except those made as of a specified date) shall be deemed to have been made again as of the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 8.2.3) or (ii) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by LMC pursuant to this Agreement. 8.2.4 No indemnification by LMC shall be due and payable under Section 8.2.3(i) in respect of any Liberty Basket Breach unless and until the cumulative amount of all Damages arising out of or resulting from all such Liberty Basket Breaches exceeds the Liberty Basket Amount, whereupon LMC will be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees for the cumulative amount of Damages incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnitees in excess of the Liberty Basket Amount, and only to the extent of such excess. LMC shall not be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees for Damages arising out of or resulting from all Liberty Basket Breaches under this Agreement in an aggregate amount in excess of the Maximum Amount.

Section 8.3. Procedures. 8.3.1 The party or parties seeking indemnification under Section 8.2 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice to the party or parties against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto in its possession that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification 65
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 8.3.2 In the case of a third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any third party claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding unless the Indemnifying Party within a reasonable time after the giving of notice of such indemnity claim by the Indemnified Party shall: (i) deliver a written confirmation to such Indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of Section 8.2 are applicable to such claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, action or proceeding pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2, (ii) notify such Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party's intention to assume the defense thereof and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding. 8.3.3 If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any such claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding in accordance herewith, then such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in any manner that the Indemnifying Party reasonably may request in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement thereof. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any such claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) any relief other than the payment of money damages is sought against the Indemnified Party or (iii) such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its regular outside counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such action would reasonably be expected (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to control the defense, compromise or settlement of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party), and in any such case described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) the reasonable fees and expenses of one such separate counsel, and one local counsel, if necessary, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such action for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless the Indemnifying Party shall have failed, after reasonable notice thereof, to undertake control of such action in the manner provided above in this Section 8.3 to the extent the Indemnifying Party was entitled to do so pursuant to this Section 8.3. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of such Indemnified Party, settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such claim, investigation, action, suit or proceeding (x) in which any relief other than the payment of money damages is or may 66
be sought against such Indemnified Party or (y) that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, party conducting such investigation, plaintiff or petitioner to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such claim, action, suit or proceeding. Section 8.4. Exclusivity. Following the Closing, except in the case of common law fraud, the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the parties with respect to any and all claims arising from any breach of this Agreement or any of the other matters addressed in Section 8.2 shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII; provided that this Section 8.4 shall not be construed so as to derogate from or otherwise limit any party's right to seek the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to any such breach. Section 8.5. Certain Rights and Limitations. 8.5.1 The treatment of any Tax costs or Tax benefits to any party as a result of any indemnification payment(s) pursuant to this Article VIII shall be as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement. 8.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no party shall be entitled to assert any right to indemnification under this Article VIII unless, and until, the Closing shall have occurred.

ARTICLE II PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS; ALLOCATION AND PAYMENT OF TAXES Section 2.1 Preparation of Tax Returns. -------------------------- 7
(a) Pre-Exchange Tax Returns. ------------------------ (i) Consolidated and Combined Returns for Pre-Exchange Periods. Where required or permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall include the Transferred Subsidiaries in, or cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to be included in, and shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed, (A) the United States consolidated federal income Tax Returns of Parent for the Taxable periods (or portions thereof) of the Transferred Subsidiaries ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (B) all other consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns for the Taxable periods (or portions thereof) of the Transferred Subsidiaries ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall pay any and all Taxes due with respect to the Tax Returns referred to in clause (A) or (B) of this Section 2.1(a)(i). (ii) Separate Returns for Pre-Exchange Periods. In addition to the Tax Returns described in Section 2.1(a)(i), Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) (A) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extensions), and (B) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extensions) for a Pre-Exchange Period (other than a Pre-Exchange Period that is part of a Straddle Period). With respect to Tax Returns described in clause (A) of this Section 2.1(a)(ii), Parent shall cause the applicable Transferred Subsidiary to file such Tax Returns and Parent shall pay any and all Taxes shown due thereon. With respect to Tax Returns described in clause (B) of this Section 2.1(a)(ii), provided that the applicable Transferred Subsidiary has received such Tax Returns from Parent not less than five days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account any applicable extensions) along with the amount of any and all Taxes shown as due thereon, LMC shall cause the applicable Transferred Subsidiary to execute and timely file such Tax Returns and timely remit such Taxes. (iii) Provision of Tax Information. After the Closing, LMC shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to furnish Tax information to Parent as reasonably requested in order to permit Parent to prepare and timely file the Pre-Exchange Tax Returns described in Section 2.1(a)(i) and (ii). (b) Other Tax Returns. All Tax Returns of the Transferred Subsidiaries other than those Tax Returns described in Section 2.1(a), shall be prepared and timely filed by LMC. LMC shall timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. (c) Straddle Returns. With respect to any Straddle Return, LMC shall deliver, at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), to Parent a statement setting forth the amount of Tax that Parent owes pursuant to clause (i) of Section 6.2, including the allocation of Taxes under Section 6.4, and copies of such Straddle Return and related work-papers. Parent shall have the right to review such Straddle Return and related work-papers and liability for Taxes and to suggest to LMC any reasonable changes to such Straddle Return no later than 10 days prior to the date for the filing of such Straddle Return. Parent and LMC agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Return and related work-papers and allocation of liability for Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as promptly as 8
possible of such Straddle Return. Not later than five days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Return (taking into account any applicable extensions), Parent shall pay to LMC an amount equal to the Taxes as agreed to by LMC and Parent as being owed by Parent pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.4 with respect to such Straddle Return. If LMC and Parent cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by Parent with respect to a Straddle Return, Parent shall pay to LMC the amount of Taxes reasonably determined using the mid-point of LMC's and Parent's determination of the amount of Taxes to be owed by Parent in respect of such Straddle Return pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.4. Within 10 days after such payment, Parent and LMC shall refer the matter to an independent nationally recognized accounting firm agreed to by LMC and Parent to arbitrate the dispute. Parent and LMC shall equally share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as to the amount owing by Parent pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.4 with respect to a Straddle Return shall be binding on both parties. Within five days after the determination by such accounting firm, if necessary, the appropriate Party shall pay the other Party any amount which is determined by such accounting firm to be owed plus interest from the due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Return (taking into account any applicable extensions) at the Interest Rate. Section 2.2 Manner of Preparation. All Tax Returns that include any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, Parent, LMC, the Stockholders, or any of their respective Affiliates, or otherwise relate to the Transferred Business or the ownership of the DTV Shares shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the Ruling Request, the Rulings, and the Tax Opinions. To the extent that the items reported on any Tax Return of or with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary that is prepared by a Party or its Affiliates is likely to increase any Tax liability or Tax indemnity obligation under this Agreement of the other Party or its Affiliates, such Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with Tax accounting and other practices used by such Transferred Subsidiary or Parent with respect to the relevant Tax Returns filed prior to the date hereof (unless such past practices are not permissible under applicable Law), and to the extent any items are not covered by past practices (or in the event such past practices are not permissible under applicable Law), in accordance with reasonable practices selected by the Party (or its Affiliate) responsible for filing such Tax Return hereunder with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the other Party. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, neither Party nor any of their respective Affiliates will make, change or revoke (or cause to be made, changed, or revoked) any Tax election with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries that is likely to increase materially any Tax liability (or Tax indemnity obligation under this Agreement) of the other Party or its Affiliates without the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the other Party. Section 2.3 Refunds, Credits or Offsets. (a) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 2.3 or Section 2.4, (i) any refunds, credits or offsets with respect to Taxes of any Transferred Subsidiaries or that otherwise relate to the Transferred Business or the ownership of the DTV Shares for a Pre-Exchange Period shall be for the account of Parent, and (ii) any refunds, credits or offsets with respect to Taxes of any Transferred Subsidiaries or that otherwise relate to the Transferred Business or the ownership of the DTV Shares for a Post-Exchange Period shall be for the account of LMC. 9
(b) Notwithstanding Section 2.3(a), (i) any refunds, credits or offsets with respect to Exchange Taxes allocated to, and actually paid by, Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall be for the account of Parent, and (ii) any refunds, credits or offsets with respect to Exchange Taxes allocated to, and actually paid by, LMC pursuant to this Agreement shall be for the account of LMC. (c) Any such refunds, credits or offsets shall be allocated between the Pre-Exchange Period and the Post-Exchange Period in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 6.4. LMC shall forward to Parent, or reimburse Parent, for any such refunds, credits or offsets, plus any interest received thereon, for the account of Parent within 10 days from receipt thereof by LMC or any of its Affiliates. Parent shall forward to LMC, or reimburse LMC, for any refunds, credits or offsets, plus any interest received thereon, for the account of LMC within 10 days from receipt thereof by Parent or any of its Affiliates. Any refunds, credits or offsets, plus any interest received thereon, or reimbursements not forwarded or made within the 10 day period specified above shall bear interest from the date received by the refunding or reimbursing party (or its Affiliate) at the Interest Rate. If, subsequent to a Taxing Authority's allowance of a refund, credit or offset, such Taxing Authority reduces or eliminates such allowance, any refund, credit or offset, plus any interest received thereon, forwarded or reimbursed under this Section 2.3 shall be returned to the party who had forwarded or reimbursed such refund, credit or offset and interest upon the request of such forwarding party in an amount equal to the applicable reduction, including any interest received thereon. Section 2.4 Carrybacks. To the extent permitted by Law, LMC and its Affiliates shall waive the right to carryback any Tax attribute of the Transferred Subsidiaries arising in a Post-Exchange Period to a Pre-Exchange Period. If and to the extent that LMC or any of its Affiliates are not permitted by applicable Law to elect to forego such carryback and LMC requests in writing that Parent or any of its Affiliates obtain a refund, credit or offset of Taxes with respect to such carryback, and provided that Parent or any of its Affiliates would not otherwise be required to forego a refund, credit or offset of Taxes for its own account or otherwise be adversely affected as a result of such carryback, then (i) Parent (or its Affiliate) shall take all reasonable measures to obtain a refund, credit or offset of Tax with respect to such carryback (including by filing an amended Tax Return), and (ii) to the extent that Parent or any of its Affiliates receives any refund, credit or offset of Taxes attributable (on a last dollar basis) to such carryback, Parent shall pay such refund, credit or offset, plus any interest net of Taxes received thereon, to LMC within 10 days from receipt thereof by Parent or any of its Affiliates; provided, that Parent shall be entitled to reduce the amount of any such refund, credit or offset for its reasonable costs and expenses; and provided further that LMC, upon the request of Parent, agrees to repay such refund, credit or offset, plus any interest net of Taxes received thereon, to Parent in the event, and to the extent, that Parent is required to repay such refund, credit or offset, plus any interest net of Taxes received thereon, to a Governmental Authority. Section 2.5 Amended Returns. Any amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund, credit or offset with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary may be made only by the Party (or its Affiliates) responsible for preparing the original Tax Return with respect to such Transferred Subsidiary pursuant to Section 2.1. Such Party (or its Affiliates) shall not, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, file, or cause to be filed, any such amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund, credit 10
or offset to the extent that such filing, if accepted, is likely to change the Tax liability of, or give rise to a payment under this Agreement by, such other Party (or any Affiliate of such other Party) for any Taxable period (or portion thereof).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4 or Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B), Taxes attributable to any transaction or action taken by or with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary out of the ordinary course of business before the Closing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the Pre-Exchange Period, and Taxes attributable to any transaction or action taken by or with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary out of the ordinary course of business after the Closing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the Post-Exchange Period. Section 6.5 Notice of Tax Contests. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of a written communication from any Taxing Authority with respect to any pending or threatened audit, dispute, suit, action, proposed assessment, or other proceeding, concerning any Tax, or any other adjustment or claim (each a "Tax Contest") (i) which could reasonably give rise to an indemnification liability or indemnification payment of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) which could reasonably be expected to affect the Tax consequences of the Exchange to either Party or its Affiliates; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except, and only to the extent that, the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party such additional information with respect to such Tax Contest in its possession that the indemnifying party may reasonably request. Section 6.6 Indemnification Procedures. (a) In the case of a Tax Contest, the indemnified party shall be entitled to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Tax Contest unless the indemnifying party within a reasonable time after the giving of notice of such Tax Contest by the indemnified party (i) delivers a written confirmation to such indemnified party that the indemnification provisions of this Agreement are applicable to such Tax Contest and that the indemnifying party will indemnify such indemnified party in respect of such Tax Contest pursuant to the applicable indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (ii) notifies such indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying party's intention to assume the defense thereof 18
and (iii) retains legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party to conduct the defense of such Tax Contest, in which case the indemnifying party shall be entitled to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of such Tax Contest. (b) If the indemnifying party so assumes the defense of any such Tax Contest in accordance herewith, then such indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in any manner that the indemnifying party reasonably may request in connection with the defense, compromise or settlement thereof. If the indemnifying party so assumes the defense of any such Tax Contest, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such indemnified party. If such indemnified party shall have been advised by outside counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or that a conflict of interest between the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in the conduct of the defense of such Tax Contest would reasonably be expected, then (i) the indemnifying party shall not have the right to control the defense, compromise or settlement of such Tax Contest on behalf of the indemnified party, (ii) the indemnifying and indemnified party shall have the right to control jointly the defense, compromise or settlement of such Tax Contest, and (iii) the reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnified party's separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party. No indemnified party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such Tax Contest for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior consent of the indemnifying party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless the indemnifying party shall have failed, after reasonable notice thereof, to undertake control of such action in the manner provided above in this Section 6.6 to the extent the indemnifying party was entitled to do so pursuant to this Section 6.6. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Tax Contest, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Tax Contest that the indemnifying party may recommend and as to which the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to make payment in full; provided that such settlement, compromise or discharge of such Tax Contest would not otherwise materially and adversely affect the indemnified party. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Tax Contest relating to the Tax-Free Status of the Transactions, both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have the right to control jointly the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Tax Contest. No indemnified party shall settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such Tax Contest without the prior consent of the indemnifying party, which consent may be withheld in the indemnifying party's sole discretion. Section 6.7 Payments. Except as otherwise provided herein, payments due under this Agreement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business Days after (i) the receipt or crediting of a refund, (ii) the realization of a Tax benefit for which the other Party is entitled to reimbursement, or (iii) the delivery of notice of payment of a Tax for which the other Party is responsible under this Agreement, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Party entitled to such payment. Payments due hereunder, but not made within such period, shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. 19
Section 6.8 Treatment of Payments; After Tax Basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Share Exchange Agreement, the Parties agree that (i) following the Closing and subject to LMC's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any amounts owing between the Parties and their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the Share Exchange Agreement shall be settled by making payments by or to Splitco instead of LMC, and (ii) any payments made between the Parties or their Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the Share Exchange Agreement (other than interest accruing on payments not timely made under such agreements) with respect to a Pre-Exchange Period or as a result of an event or action occurring in a Pre-Exchange Period shall be treated, to the extent permitted by law, for all Tax purposes as a distribution from or a capital contribution to Splitco made immediately prior to the Exchange. If the receipt or accrual of any such payment results in Taxable income (including an increase in the amount of any gain or other income realized on the Exchange) to the recipient thereof, such payment shall be increased so that, after the payment of any Taxes with respect to the payment, the recipient thereof shall have realized the same net amount it would have realized had the payment not resulted in Taxable income. To the extent that Taxes for which one Party (the indemnifying Party) is required to pay the other Party (the indemnified party) pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Taxes") may be deducted or credited in determining the amount of any other Taxes required to be paid by the indemnified Party (for example, state Taxes which are permitted to be deducted in determining federal Taxes), the amount of any payment made to the indemnified Party by the indemnifying Party shall be decreased by taking into account any resulting reduction in other Taxes of the indemnified Party. If such a reduction in Taxes of the indemnified Party occurs following the payment made to the indemnified Party with respect to the relevant Indemnified Taxes, the indemnified Party shall promptly repay the indemnifying Party the amount of such reduction when actually realized. If the Tax benefit arising from the foregoing reduction of Taxes described in this Section 6.8 is subsequently decreased or eliminated, then the indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the indemnified Party the amount of the decrease in such Tax benefit. ARTICLE VII COOPERATION Section 7.1 General. Parent, LMC and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with each other and with each other's agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in connection with (a) Tax matters relating to the Transferred Subsidiaries and their assets and operations, including (i) preparation and filing of Tax Returns, (ii) determining the liability and amount of any Taxes due, the right to and amount of any refund, credit or offset of Taxes and the amount of any Tax attributes allocable to the Transferred Subsidiaries, (iii) obtaining any refund, credit or offset of Taxes, (iv) examinations of Tax Returns, and (v) any administrative or judicial proceeding, or other Tax Contest, in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed, and (b) the defense of any Tax Contest involving the Exchange or the Parent Restructuring.

Section 7.2 Consistent Treatment. Unless and until there has been a Final Determination to the contrary, each Party agrees (a) to treat the Exchange as a tax-free exchange under Section 355(a) of the Code, and (b) not to take any position on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Contest, or otherwise for Tax purposes (in each case, excluding any position taken for financial accounting purposes) that is inconsistent with (i) the allocation of Taxes and Tax benefits hereunder, (ii) the Rulings, (iii) the Tax Opinions, or (iv) the Tax-Free Status of the Transactions.

At or before the Closing, Parent shall provide to LMC (to the extent not previously provided or held by any Transferred Subsidiary at Closing) copies of (A) the separate Tax Returns of any Transferred Subsidiaries, (B) the relevant portions of any other Tax Returns with respect to any Transferred Subsidiaries, and (C) other existing Tax records (or the relevant portions thereof) reasonably necessary to prepare and file any Tax Returns of, or with respect to, the Transferred Subsidiaries, or to defend or contest Tax matters relevant to the Transferred Subsidiaries, including in each case, all Tax records related to Tax attributes of the Transferred Subsidiaries and any and all communications or agreements with, or rulings by, any Taxing Authority with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary. Section 8.2 Retention of Records; Access.

Section 8.3 Confidentiality; Ownership of Information; Privileged Information. Each Party hereby agrees that it will hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence all records and information prepared and shared by and among the Parties in carrying out the intent of this Agreement, unless disclosure is compelled by a Governmental Authority. Information and documents of one Party (the "Disclosing Party") shall not be deemed to be confidential for purposes of this Section 8.3 to the extent such information or document (i) is previously known to or in the possession of the other party (the "Receiving Party") and is not otherwise subject to a requirement to keep confidential, (ii) becomes publicly available by means other than unauthorized disclosure under this Agreement or the Share Exchange Agreement by the Receiving Party or (iii) is received from a third party without, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party after reasonable diligence, a duty of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party. 21

The obligations set forth above in Section 8.2 shall continue until the longer of (a) the time of a Final Determination of any controversy with respect to such Taxable period and until the final determination of any payments that may be required with respect to such Taxable period under this Agreement, or (b) expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions thereof) of the Taxable period to which the records and information relate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, each Party shall assume that no applicable statute of limitations has expired unless such Party has received notification or otherwise has actual knowledge that such statute of limitations has expired.

Exhibit 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED] News Corporation TTED] - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NEWS RELEASE - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For Immediate Release NEWS CORPORATION AND LIBERTY MEDIA CORPORATION SIGN SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT - ------------------------ NEW YORK, NY, December 22, 2006 - News Corporation today announced that it had signed a Share Exchange Agreement with Liberty Media Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Liberty will exchange its entire 16.3 percent economic position (324.6 million Class A and 188 million Class B shares) in News Corporation for a 38.4 percent stake (470.4 million shares) in The DIRECTV Group, three Regional Sports Networks (FSN Northwest, FSN Pittsburgh and FSN Rocky Mountain) and $550 million of cash, subject to a working capital adjustment. News Corporation believes the transaction will unlock tremendous value for the following reasons: o The transaction will be immediately accretive to News Corporation's earnings per share; o News Corporation will divest its stake in DIRECTV at an attractive valuation on a tax-free basis; and o News Corporation will accomplish an approximately $11 billion stock buyback representing approximately 16% of the outstanding stock. The share exchange agreement is subject to various regulatory approvals and an affirmative vote by a majority of holders of News Corporation's Class B common stock, other than the Murdoch family and Liberty. If approved, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of calendar 2007. Following completion of the transaction with Liberty, News Corporation intends to redeem its stockholder rights plan and will consider eliminating its staggered board. With negotiations over the share exchange agreement now completed, News Corporation expects to continue its previously announced stock repurchase program. News Corporation (NYSE: NWS, NWS.A; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) had total assets as of September 30, 2006 of approximately US$58 billion and total annual revenues of approximately US$26 billion. News Corporation is a diversified entertainment company with operations in eight industry segments: filmed entertainment; television; cable network programming; direct broadcast satellite television; magazines and inserts; newspapers; book publishing; and other.
