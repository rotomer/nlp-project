The transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's Class B common stock, other than the shares owned by the Murdoch Interests and Liberty.
 
A copy of the Share Exchange Agreement was filed as exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed December 26, 2006. A copy of Amendment No. 1 is filed as exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
