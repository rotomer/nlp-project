ITEM 1.01
  
ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On July 31, 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Dow Jones"), News Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Ruby Newco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Newco"), and Diamond Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Newco ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Dow Jones and Dow Jones will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco (the "Merger").
 
Merger Agreement
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Dow Jones common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, either (x) $60.00 in cash or (y) a number of Class B units of Newco equal to $60.00 divided by the volume weighted average closing price of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock over the five trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the closing date (the "Equity Consideration"). However, not more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Dow Jones common stock may be converted into Newco Class B units and not more than 250 holders of record may receive Newco Class B units. If more than 250 holders of record of Dow Jones common stock and Class B common stock elect to receive Newco Class B units, only the elections of the 250 holders making a unit election with respect to the greatest number of Dow Jones shares will be honored. Moreover, if the stock elections by those 250 holders are made with respect to more than 10% in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of Dow Jones common stock and Class B common stock, the number of shares of each holder converted into the Equity Consideration will be prorated.
The boards of directors of Dow Jones and the Company have approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Dow Jones and the Company. The transaction is conditioned upon:
 
 
 
 
During the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, Dow Jones shall operate its business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice. Additionally, during such period, Dow Jones is restricted from taking certain actions without obtaining the prior consent of the Company.
The Merger Agreement prohibits Dow Jones from soliciting or encouraging competing proposals. However, Dow Jones may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, provide information to, and negotiate with, a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal that the Dow Jones board of directors determines constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a "Superior Acquisition Proposal" (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Dow Jones and the Company, including, among other things, the right of Dow Jones to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement for an alternative business combination transaction that constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal if Dow Jones complies with certain notice and other requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement and the right of the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances in the event that the Bancroft Investors (as defined below) terminate the Voting Agreement in connection with a "Superior Acquisition Proposal" (as defined in the Voting Agreement). Furthermore, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including by Dow Jones to accept a Superior Acquisition Proposal, Dow Jones would be required to pay to the Company a termination fee of $165,000,000 (less any expenses previously paid as described in the next sentence). In addition, if the Dow Jones stockholders vote on the Merger and fail to approve the Merger, Dow Jones must reimburse the documented expenses of the Company up to a maximum amount of $25,000,000.
Editorial Agreement
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the Company must execute an agreement relating to editorial and journalistic independence and integrity (the "Editorial Agreement") and the Company must establish a Special Committee comprised of five distinguished community or journalistic leaders who are independent of the Company, Dow Jones, the Murdoch family and the Bancroft family. The parties have agreed that the initial members of the Special Committee will be Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jennifer Dunn, Jack Fuller and Nicholas Negroponte.
Under the Editorial Agreement, the Special Committee will have rights of approval over the following "Special Committee Matters":
 
 
 
 
The authority of each Editor will include:
 
Under the Editorial Agreement, the Company will be required to maintain a set of principles aimed at ensuring the preservation of the integrity, editorial independence and freedom from bias of the Dow Jones Publications. These principles (the "News Corp Principles") will ensure that in the Dow Jones Publications:
 
Under the Editorial Agreement, the Company will agree that the News Corp Principles will apply, and the existing Dow Jones Code of Conduct relating to appropriate professional conduct
 
 
(the "Dow Jones Code of Conduct") will continue to apply, following the Merger, to Dow Jones and to all journalists and journalism of Dow Jones and to the Dow Jones Publications, as defined in the Editorial Agreement. The Special Committee will aid the preservation and promotion of the News Corp Principles and the Dow Jones Code of Conduct for this purpose.
Each Editor will have the right to appeal to the Special Committee disputes with the Company or Dow Jones concerning the Special Committee Matters described above and disputes relating to the News Corp Principles and the Dow Jones Code of Conduct (but only to the extent any dispute relates to Dow Jones, any of its subsidiaries, a Dow Jones Publication or to journalists or journalism of Dow Jones or its subsidiaries or a Dow Jones Publication). All decisions and determinations made by the Special Committee with respect to any such dispute will be final and binding.
Any actions or decisions of the Special Committee may be made public by the Special Committee, including, if requested by the Special Committee, on the editorial page of all editions of
The
Wall Street Journal
, subject to the approval of the editorial page editor or, if for any reason this approval is not granted for any edition of
The
Wall Street Journal
, in a prominent location in that edition of
The
Wall Street Journal
.
The Special Committee will be entitled to enforce its rights and the terms of, and any decisions or determinations made under, the Editorial Agreement against the Company or Dow Jones.
Voting Agreement
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company has entered into a voting and support agreement (the "Voting Agreement") with certain members of the Bancroft family and the trustees of trusts for their benefit (the "Bancroft Investors") holding in the aggregate approximately 37% of the total voting power of the Company. Under the Voting Agreement the Bancroft Investors have agreed:
 
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company board of directors shall take all requisite action to cause a member of the Bancroft family or another mutually agreed upon individual (the "Initial Bancroft Director") to become a member of the class of the Company board of directors with the longest remaining term as of the closing of the Merger.
 
Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for a period of ten years following the closing of the Merger, if at any time the seat on the Company board of directors held by the Initial Bancroft Director shall become vacant or the Initial Bancroft Director shall not be re-nominated, the Chairman of the Company's board of directors shall propose another member of the Bancroft family to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Company's board of directors for nomination for appointment or election to the Company board of directors in accordance with the Voting Agreement, with such process continuing until the Initial Bancroft Director has been replaced on the Company board of directors by another member of the Bancroft family. Such obligations
 
 
 
will also be applicable to the replacement of any successor to the Initial Bancroft Director in accordance with the Voting Agreement during the 10 year period. All commitments of the Company's board of directors and the Chairman of the Company board of directors described in the preceding two sentences shall terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement for any reason other than occurrence of the effective time of the Merger.
 
Mr. K. Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust have entered into a separate voting agreement obligating them, for a period of ten years, to vote in favor of the election of the Initial Bancroft Director or any successor thereto in accordance with the Voting Agreement at any meeting of the Company's stockholders at which any such individuals stands for election. All commitments of Mr. K. Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust described in the preceding sentence shall terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement for any reason other than occurrence of the effective time of the Merger.
 
The Voting Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of the effective time of the Merger and the date that the Merger Agreement has been terminated. The Voting Agreement shall also terminate if the Dow Jones Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of the Merger or if holders of a majority of the voting power subject to the Voting Agreement terminate the Voting Agreement in connection with their receipt of a "Superior Acquisition Proposal" (as defined in the Voting Agreement).
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Editorial Agreement and the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements. Copies of the Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the form of Editorial Agreement are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.
The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter provided by Dow Jones in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. The disclosure letter contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Dow Jones and the Company rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Dow Jones or the Company.
 
 
On July 31, 2007, Dow Jones and the Company issued a joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
Such press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(ii) Subject to Sections 2.1(e), 2.3 and 2.6, each issued and outstanding share of Diamond Common Stock (other than shares of Diamond Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(i)) shall be converted into the right to receive from Ruby Newco either the Unit Consideration or the Cash Consideration (the Unit Consideration or the Cash Consideration, as applicable, the "Merger Consideration"), with the form of Merger Consideration determined as follows: (1) each share of Diamond Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive the Unit Consideration has been effectively made and not revoked or lost (and not converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to Sections 2.1(d)(iii) or 2.1(d)(iv)) (each, a "Unit Electing Diamond Share") shall be converted into the right to receive from Ruby Newco that number (expressed as a decimal) of fully paid and nonassessable Ruby Newco Class B Units (the "Unit Consideration") equal to the quotient of (A) $60.00 divided by (B) the Average Ruby Trading Price, calculated to the nearest ten thousandth (i.e., four decimal places (.xxxx)) (the "Exchange Ratio"); and (2) each other share of Diamond Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive from Ruby Newco an amount equal to $60.00 in cash without interest (the "Cash Consideration"). (iii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (b) All shares of Diamond Common Stock to be converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired and cease to exist; and each holder of a certificate representing prior to the Effective Time any such shares of Diamond Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.3(e) hereof and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional Ruby Newco Class B Unit in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof. (c) Elections. (i) Each Person (other than Ruby, Diamond or any of their respective Subsidiaries) who on or prior to the Election Deadline is a holder of record of shares of Diamond Common Stock as evidenced by Certificates (provided that, in order for a valid Unit Election to be made under this Section 2.1(c) with respect to shares of Diamond Common Stock held on behalf of a beneficial owner through a broker, dealer, bank or similar nominee (it being understood that a trust or trustee shall not be considered a nominee for this purpose) or in the name of a participant in the Depositary Trust Company's book-entry transfer system, prior to such Unit Election such shares shall have been withdrawn from such arrangement and shall be held in the form of Certificates) shall be entitled, with respect to all or a portion of such shares of Diamond Common Stock, to make an election (a "Unit Election"), on or prior to the Election 4
Deadline, to receive the Unit Consideration on the basis set forth in this Agreement. Each Person receiving the Unit Consideration pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to have executed the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement as a Class B Unitholder (as defined thereunder) by virtue of such receipt and without any further action on any such Person's part. (ii) Ruby shall prepare a form, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Diamond (an "Election Form"), pursuant to which a holder of record of shares of Diamond Common Stock may make a Unit Election with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock held by such holder. The Election Form shall include statements and representations substantially in a form to be mutually agreed upon by Ruby and Diamond as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement ("Election Form Representations") that would be made by each holder of record submitting an Election Form (or, if the record holder is not the Person having discretion as to the matters covered by the Election Form Representations, then on behalf of the Person having such discretion). The Election Form shall provide that the Election Form Representations are being made as of the date the Election Form is submitted and as of the Effective Time. Diamond shall mail the Election Form, together with the Proxy Statement, to each holder of record of shares of Diamond Common Stock on the record date for the Diamond Stockholder Meeting and shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Election Form available to any person who becomes a record holder of shares of Diamond Common Stock during the period between the record date and the Election Deadline. (iii) A Unit Election shall be effective only if (A) the Exchange Agent shall have received an Election Form covering the shares of Diamond Common Stock to which such Unit Election applies, executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth in such Election Form, together with the Certificates as to which the Unit Election is being made, no later than the later to occur of (subject to Section 6.4) (x) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the Closing Date and (y) the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the Diamond Stockholder Meeting (the "Election Deadline") and (B) the Election Form Representations are properly made pursuant to the Election Form (or with changes to such Election Form Representations as may be acceptable to counsel delivering the Tax Opinion in counsel's sole discretion) and not withdrawn. Ruby and Diamond shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the anticipated Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the anticipated Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Ruby and Diamond shall promptly publicly announce any delay and, when determined, the rescheduled anticipated Election Deadline. A Unit Election may be revoked or changed only by delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written notice of revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised Election Form that identifies the shares of Diamond Common Stock to which the revised Election Form applies. Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect to any shares of Diamond Common Stock shall result in the revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all such shares of Diamond Common Stock. Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII shall result in the revocation of all Election Forms delivered to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of termination. In the event of a revocation of a Unit Election with respect to any shares of Diamond Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall immediately return any 5
Certificates relating to such shares delivered to the Exchange Agent in connection with the making of such election to the Diamond stockholder that previously made such election. (d) Proration. (i) The number of holders of record (as defined for purposes of Rule 12g5-1 under the Exchange Act) of Diamond Common Stock eligible to receive the Unit Consideration shall not exceed 250 (the "Maximum Unitholder Number"). (ii) The number of shares of Diamond Common Stock eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Unit Consideration at the Effective Time shall not exceed 8,599,159 shares of Diamond Common Stock (the "Unit Election Number"). (iii) If the number of holders making valid Unit Elections in accordance with Section 2.1(c) (each a "Unit Electing Holder") does not exceed the Maximum Unitholder Number, each Unit Electing Holder's Unit Electing Diamond Shares shall be converted into the Unit Consideration, subject to Section 2.1(d)(iv). If the number of Unit Electing Holders exceeds the Maximum Unitholder Number, the Unit Electing Diamond Shares of the 250 Unit Electing Holders that made (and did not revoke) a valid Unit Election with respect to the greatest number of shares of Diamond Common Stock shall be converted into the Unit Consideration, subject to Section 2.1(d)(iv); and the Unit Electing Diamond Shares of the remaining Unit Electing Holders shall be converted into the Cash Consideration as if the shares were not Unit Electing Diamond Shares. (iv) After giving effect to the allocations and adjustments described in Section 2.1(d)(iii), if any, (1) if the number of Unit Electing Diamond Shares exceeds the Unit Election Number, then the Unit Electing Diamond Shares shall be treated in the following manner: (A) A unit proration factor (the "Unit Proration Factor") shall be determined by dividing the Unit Election Number by the total number of Unit Electing Diamond Shares. (B) A number of Unit Electing Diamond Shares covered by each Unit Electing Holder's Unit Election equal to the product of (x) the Unit Proration Factor and (y) the total number of Unit Electing Diamond Shares covered by such Unit Election shall be converted into the right to receive the Unit Consideration. (C) Each Unit Electing Diamond Share other than those converted into the right to receive the Unit Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.1(d)(iv)(1)(B), shall 6
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration as if the shares of Diamond Common Stock were not Unit Electing Diamond Shares. (2) If the number of Unit Electing Diamond Shares is less than or equal to the Unit Election Number, then each Unit Electing Diamond Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Unit Consideration. (e) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of Diamond Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to the Merger in writing and who has demanded appraisal for those shares in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless the holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, the holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, those shares of Diamond Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Cash Consideration. Diamond shall give Ruby prompt notice of any demands received by Diamond for appraisal of shares of Diamond Common Stock, and Ruby shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to those demands. Except with the prior written consent of Ruby, Diamond shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any demands for appraisal of shares of Diamond Common Stock. Diamond shall serve prompt notice (but in any event within four (4) Business Days) to Ruby of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by Diamond in respect of any shares of Diamond Common Stock. Section 2.2 Diamond Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units; Contingent Stock Rights. (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Diamond Common Stock (including each stock appreciation right in respect of shares of Diamond Common Stock) awarded under any stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond, to the extent such option (or stock appreciation right) is, immediately prior to the Effective Time, exercisable for the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject thereto, shall be cancelled and of no further force and effect with respect to the shares of Diamond Common Stock for which such option (or stock appreciation right) was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. The holder of such option (or stock appreciation right) shall be entitled to receive from Diamond on the Closing Date an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock for which such option (or stock appreciation right) was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share (or base price per share in the case of stock appreciation rights) of such option (or stock appreciation right) (the "Vested Diamond Option Payment"). The foregoing shall not apply to any option (or stock appreciation right) with an exercise price (or base price) that equals or exceeds the Cash Consideration (an 7
"Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option"). Each Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option shall be adjusted at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.2(d). (b) Subject to Section 2.2(c), as of the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Diamond Common Stock (including each stock appreciation right in respect of shares of Diamond Common Stock) awarded under any stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond, to the extent such option (or stock appreciation right) is, immediately prior to the Effective Time, not exercisable for the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject thereto (each, an "Unvested Diamond Option") shall be converted into a right to receive from Diamond, for each share of Diamond Common Stock subject to such option (or stock appreciation right) for which such option (or stock appreciation right) was not exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over the exercise price per share (or base price per share in the case of stock appreciation rights) of such option (or stock appreciation right) (the "Unvested Diamond Option Payment"). The Unvested Diamond Option Payment with respect to each such share of Diamond Common Stock shall be payable on the date, if any, upon which the applicable option (or stock appreciation right) would have become exercisable for such share of Diamond Common Stock under the terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, vesting and accelerated vesting terms and conditions) that are applicable, and would be applicable, to such option (or stock appreciation right), in each case as of the date of this Agreement (as modified in accordance with this Agreement) absent this Section 2.2(b) (but taking into account any changes to such option under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The foregoing shall not apply to any Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option. Each Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option shall be adjusted at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.2(d). (c) Each holder of an Unvested Diamond Option (that is not an Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option) may elect, by delivery to each of Diamond and Ruby no later than the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the Closing Date of a form of election prepared and distributed to such holders by Diamond, subject to review and approval by Ruby, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (an "Option Conversion Election"), to have all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Unvested Diamond Option for which such Unvested Diamond Option was not exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time converted at the Effective Time into an option to acquire shares of (or a stock appreciation right with respect to) Ruby A Common Stock (on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Unvested Diamond Option, but taking into account any changes to such option under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If a holder of an Unvested Diamond Option makes the Option Conversion Election with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Unvested Diamond Option, the holder shall not be entitled to receive the Unvested Diamond Option Payments in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 2.2(b), but instead such Unvested Diamond Option (solely with respect to the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Unvested Diamond Option for which an Option 8
Conversion Election was made) shall become, as of the Effective Time, an option to acquire (or a stock appreciation right with respect to) that number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock (a "Ruby Option") that is equal to the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Unvested Diamond Option for which an Option Conversion Election was made multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share) and such Ruby Option shall have an exercise price (or base price) per share of Ruby A Common Stock (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price (or base price) specified in such Unvested Diamond Option divided by the Exchange Ratio and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the applicable Unvested Diamond Option (but taking into account any changes to such option under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided that, in the case of any Unvested Diamond Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price (or base price), the number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock subject to the Ruby Option into which it is converted and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Ruby Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; and provided, further, that, in the case of any Unvested Diamond Option with respect to which the Option Conversion Election was made, the exercise price, the number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock subject to the Ruby Option into which it is converted and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Ruby Option shall be determined in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. (d) As of the Effective Time, each Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then exercisable) shall be converted into a Ruby Option for a number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), and such Ruby Option shall have an exercise price (or base price) per share of Ruby A Common Stock (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise price (or base price) specified in such Out-of-the Money Diamond Option divided by the Exchange Ratio and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the applicable Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option (but taking into account any changes to such option under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided that, in the case of any Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price (or base price), the number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock subject to the Ruby Option into which it is converted and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Ruby Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; and provided, further, that, in the case of any Out-of-the-Money Diamond Option, the exercise price, the number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock subject to the Ruby Option into which it is converted and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Ruby Option shall be determined in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 9
(e) Subject to Section 2.2(g), as of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted Diamond Common Stock awarded under any compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond (each, a share of "Diamond Restricted Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration (the "Diamond Restricted Stock Payment") on the date upon which the applicable share of Diamond Restricted Stock would vest, and would have vested, under the terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, vesting and accelerated vesting terms and conditions) that would have been applicable to such share of Diamond Restricted Stock absent the provisions of this Section 2.2(e) (but taking into account any changes to such Diamond Restricted Stock under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). (f) Subject to Section 2.2(g), as of the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit in respect of a share of Diamond Common Stock (each, a "Diamond Restricted Stock Unit," and together with the Diamond Restricted Stock, a "Diamond Equity Right"), shall be converted into the right to receive (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) all dividend equivalents in respect thereof (the "Diamond Restricted Stock Unit Payment"), on the date upon which the Diamond Restricted Stock Unit would vest, and would have vested, under the terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, vesting and accelerated vesting terms and conditions) that would have been applicable to such Diamond Restricted Stock Unit absent the provisions of this Section 2.2(f) (but taking into account any changes to such Diamond Restricted Stock Unit under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). (g) Each holder of a Diamond Equity Right may elect, by delivery to each of Diamond and Ruby no later than the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the Closing Date of a form of election prepared and distributed to such holder by Diamond, subject to review and approval by Ruby, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (an "Equity Right Conversion Election") to have all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such holder's Diamond Equity Rights converted at the Effective Time into, as applicable, restricted shares of Ruby A Common Stock or restricted stock units in respect of shares of Ruby A Common Stock (each, a "Ruby Equity Right"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the applicable Diamond Equity Right (but taking into account any changes to such Diamond Equity Right under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If the holder of a Diamond Equity Right makes the Equity Right Conversion Election with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such holder's Diamond Equity Rights, the holder shall not be entitled to receive a Diamond Restricted Stock Payment or a Diamond Restricted Stock Unit Payment in respect of such shares in accordance with Sections 2.2(e) and/or 2.2(f), as applicable, but instead such Diamond Equity Rights (solely with respect to the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Diamond Equity Rights for which an Equity Rights Conversion Election was made) shall become, as of the Effective Time, a Ruby Equity Right with respect to a number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock equal to the number 10
of shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to the Diamond Equity Right multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share) and otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the applicable Diamond Equity Right (but taking into account any changes to such Diamond Equity Right under the terms of any applicable stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If a holder of a Diamond Equity Right makes the Equity Right Conversion Election with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such holder's Diamond Equity Rights, any dividend equivalents credited to the account of such holder as of the Effective Time with respect to such shares subject to such election shall be similarly converted in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(g). (h) Subject to Section 2.2(i), each outstanding Contingent Stock Right (as defined in the Diamond 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP")) shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the LTIP, and the Final Award (as defined in the LTIP) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive in cash from Diamond at the time or times set forth in the LTIP an amount equal to the product of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock constituting the Final Award (the "Diamond CSR Payment"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Factiva Long Term Incentive Plan shall terminate and substitute awards shall not be granted; each participant therein shall thereby receive at the Effective Time a cash payment in accordance with such plan. (i) Each holder of a Contingent Stock Right may elect, by delivery to Diamond no later than the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the Closing Date of a form of election prepared and distributed to such holders by Diamond, subject to review and approval by Ruby, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (a "Contingent Stock Right Conversion Election") to have all or a portion of the shares constituting such holder's Final Award converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive shares of Ruby A Common Stock at the time or times set forth in the LTIP (but taking into account any changes under the LTIP occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If the holder of a Contingent Stock Right makes the Contingent Stock Right Conversion Election with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Diamond Common Stock constituting the Final Award, such holder shall not be entitled to receive a Diamond CSR Payment in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 2.2(h), but instead such Contingent Stock Right (solely with respect to the shares of Diamond Common Stock subject to such Contingent Stock Right for which a Contingent Stock Right Conversion Election was made) shall become, as of the Effective Time, a Contingent Stock Right in respect of a number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock (a "Ruby Contingent Stock Right") equal to the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock constituting the Final Award with respect to which the Contingent Stock Right Conversion Election was made multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share) and otherwise on the terms as set forth in the LTIP (but taking into account any changes under the LTIP occurring by reason of the change of control resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 11
(j) Following the Effective Time, Ruby shall maintain each equity or equity-based compensation plan of Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary (collectively, the "Diamond Stock Plans") for purposes of administering the Ruby Options, Ruby Equity Rights and Contingent Stock Rights in respect of Ruby A Common Stock described in this Section 2.2 and granting future awards in accordance with NYSE rules. The provisions of such Diamond Stock Plans, including the respective terms of such plans, shall not be changed by Ruby (other than for technical amendments that are not adverse to participants in any such Diamond Stock Plan), except that (i) all awards issued by Ruby pursuant to the Diamond Stock Plans following the Effective Time shall be awards in respect of Ruby A Common Stock and (ii) the number of shares of Ruby A Common Stock available for future issuance pursuant to each Diamond Stock Plan following the Effective Time (the "Available Diamond Stock Plan Shares") shall be equal to the number of shares of Diamond Common Stock so available immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share of Ruby A Common Stock. (k) The Diamond Board of Directors or an appropriate committee of the Diamond Board of Directors shall take all necessary or appropriate action to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2. Ruby shall cause the Vested Diamond Option Payments, the Unvested Diamond Option Payments, the Diamond Restricted Stock Payments, the Diamond Restricted Stock Unit Payments and the Diamond CSR Payments to be made, and the Option Conversion Elections, the Equity Right Conversion Elections and the Contingent Stock Right Conversion Elections to be honored, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2. (l) Ruby shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be registered the Ruby Options, the Ruby Equity Rights and Ruby Contingent Stock Right to be issued pursuant to Sections 2.2(c), (d), (g) and (i) and the Ruby A Common Stock subject to Ruby Options, Ruby Equity Rights and Ruby Contingent Stock Rights described in this Section 2.2 (and the Available Diamond Stock Plan Shares, as appropriate), in each case, pursuant to the Registration Statement and shall maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the Ruby A Common Stock subject to such Ruby Options, Ruby Equity Rights and Ruby Contingent Stock Rights (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Ruby Options, Ruby Equity Rights or Ruby Contingent Stock Rights remain outstanding. Ruby shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and submit to the NYSE and the ASX applications covering the shares of Ruby A Common Stock which may be issued from time to time following the Effective Time upon exercise of Ruby Options or in connection with the Ruby Equity Rights or Ruby Contingent Stock Rights and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such securities to be approved for listing on the NYSE and the ASX, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. Section 2.3 Exchange of and Payment for Securities. (a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Ruby and Ruby Newco shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of (i) mailing and receiving Election Forms and determining, in accordance with this 12
Article II, the form of Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of shares of Diamond Common Stock and (ii) exchanging the applicable Merger Consideration (A) for certificates representing shares of Diamond Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (B) for uncertificated shares of Diamond Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At the Closing, Ruby Newco shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as needed, the applicable Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Ruby Newco shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Diamond Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than any record holder of Diamond Common Stock who has previously made (and not revoked) a valid Unit Election with respect to all of such holder's shares of Diamond Common Stock) a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in the exchange. (b) Each holder of shares of Diamond Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, (x) in the case of Unit Electing Diamond Shares, promptly after the Closing, and (y) in the case of all other shares of Diamond Common Stock, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or any other evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable or issuable in respect of such Unit Electing Diamond Shares or Diamond Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, as applicable. The Ruby Newco Class B Units constituting part of such Merger Consideration (if any), at Ruby Newco's option, shall be issued in the form of physical certificates in accordance with the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. (c) If any portion of the Cash Consideration is to be paid or issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to that payment that (i) either the Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or the Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting the payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer Taxes required as a result of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Diamond Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. 13
(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available or caused to be made available by Ruby Newco to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Diamond Common Stock nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Ruby Newco upon demand, and any holder who has not exchanged shares of Diamond Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Ruby Newco, as a general creditor thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon), and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of those shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Ruby, Ruby Newco nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Diamond Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Diamond Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or that earlier date, immediately prior to the time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Ruby Newco, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or Section 2.4 to pay for shares of Diamond Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been demanded and not validly withdrawn, within sixty (60) days from the Effective Time, shall be returned to Ruby Newco upon demand. Section 2.4 No Fractional Ruby Newco Class B Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a Ruby Newco Class B Unit will be issued and no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest with respect to Ruby Newco Class B Units shall relate to any such fraction, and such fraction shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a security holder of Ruby Newco Class B Units. In lieu of any such fraction of Ruby Newco Class B Units, each holder of shares of Diamond Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a Ruby Newco Class B Unit will be entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4 from the Exchange Agent a cash payment, without interest, equal to product of (x) the fractional interest in a Ruby Newco Class B Unit that such holder would be otherwise entitled to receive and (y) the amount of the Cash Consideration. Section 2.5 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.1 hereof, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Ruby A Common Stock or Diamond Common Stock, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Diamond Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Section 2.6 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Ruby or Ruby Newco, the posting by the Person of a bond in the reasonable amount as Ruby Newco may direct as indemnity against any claim 14
that may be made against Ruby, Ruby Newco or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Diamond Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Ruby Newco Class B Units deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Ruby, Ruby Newco or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement those amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of that payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by or on behalf of Ruby or Ruby Newco, as the case may be, those withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by or on behalf of Ruby or Ruby Newco, as the case may be. Section 2.8 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Ruby, Ruby Newco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Ruby, Ruby Newco or Diamond, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, Ruby, Ruby Newco or Diamond, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Ruby, Ruby Newco or the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by Ruby, Ruby Newco or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 15

Diamond is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Diamond has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease, operate its properties, and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the absence thereof, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. Diamond is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (to the extent that concept exists in such jurisdictions) in which the nature of the business it is conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties makes this qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. Diamond has previously made available to Ruby complete and correct copies of Diamond's certificate of incorporation (the "Diamond Certificate of Incorporation") and bylaws (the "Diamond Bylaws") in each case as currently in effect, and no dissolution, revocation or forfeiture proceedings regarding Diamond have been commenced and Diamond is not in violation of any provision of the Diamond Certificate of Incorporation or the Diamond Bylaws in any material respect. Section 3.2 Diamond Subsidiaries. (a) Each Diamond Subsidiary is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation (to 16
the extent that that concept exists in such jurisdiction) except where the failure thereof would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. Each Diamond Subsidiary has all requisite corporate, partnership, limited liability company or other organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties, and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the absence thereof would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. Each Diamond Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction (to the extent that such concept exists in such jurisdiction) in which the nature of the business it is now conducting or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of properties for others makes this qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. Diamond has previously made available to Ruby complete and correct copies of the charter and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of each Key Diamond Subsidiary and such certificates of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents are in full force and effect, no dissolution, revocation or forfeiture proceedings regarding any Key Diamond Subsidiary have been commenced and no Key Diamond Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents in any material respect. (b) All outstanding equity interests in each Diamond Subsidiary that is not a Key Diamond Subsidiary have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and (except for partnership interests) non-assessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights and are owned directly or indirectly by Diamond, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Diamond Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding equity interests in each Key Diamond Subsidiary have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and (except for partnership interests) non-assessable, and are not subject to any preemptive rights and are owned directly or indirectly by Diamond, free and clear of all pledges, liens, or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever or any material or, to the Knowledge of Diamond, any immaterial claim, charge or other encumbrance of any kind or nature. Except for the capital stock and equity interests of the Diamond Subsidiaries, Diamond does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity, other than an investment in publicly traded securities constituting three percent (3%) or less of a class of outstanding securities of any entity. Section 3.3 Capitalization. (a) The authorized shares of capital stock of Diamond consist of (i) 135,000,000 shares of Diamond Class A Stock and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of Diamond Class B Stock. As of the close of business on July 29, 2007 (the "Capitalization Date"), there are issued and outstanding: (a) 66,520,660 shares of Diamond Class A Stock (which amount includes 107,560 restricted shares of Diamond Class A Stock granted under any stock option or compensation plan, agreement or arrangement of Diamond) and (b) 19,470,932 shares of 17
Diamond Class B Stock. As of the Capitalization Date, there are outstanding Diamond Options to purchase an aggregate of 7,511,287 shares of Diamond Class A Stock.

(b) All outstanding shares of Diamond are, and all shares reserved for issuance will be, upon issuance in accordance with the terms specified in the instruments or agreements pursuant to which they are issuable, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of, any preemptive right, purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, subscription or any other similar right.

in accordance with Section 7.1(h), as the case may be), Diamond shall provide Ruby with Diamond's stockholder list and, following such Recommendation Withdrawal or recommendation of a Superior Acquisition Proposal until such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, Ruby may contact Diamond's stockholders and prospective investors without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 5.7. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, Ruby shall promptly return such stockholder list. Section 5.3 No Solicitation. (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), until the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, none of Diamond, the Diamond Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers shall, and each of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or providing access to the properties, books or records of Diamond or the Diamond Subsidiaries) the submission of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Diamond Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with a Person or Persons who have made, or, to the Knowledge of Diamond, may make, a Diamond Acquisition Proposal, or their respective Representatives with respect to any Diamond Acquisition Proposal or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or participate in, or knowingly encourage, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations; (ii) approve or recommend a Diamond Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement providing for a Diamond Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) submit to the stockholders of Diamond for their approval or adoption any Diamond Acquisition Proposal or, agree or publicly announce any intention to take any of the foregoing actions. Diamond shall, and shall cause each Diamond Subsidiary and its and their respective officers to, and each of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its other Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Diamond Acquisition Proposal and Diamond shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished by or on behalf of Diamond be returned. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a), if at any time prior to obtaining the Diamond Stockholder Approval, (i) Diamond has received a bona fide written Diamond Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a breach of Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement (and did not result from actions taken by any director of Diamond that would have constituted a breach of Section 5.3(a) if such actions had been taken by an officer of Diamond) and (ii) the Diamond Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that the Diamond Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Acquisition Proposal, then Diamond may (A) furnish information with 42
respect to Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons making such Diamond Acquisition Proposal and their respective Representatives and financing sources and potential purchasers of a portion of Diamond's assets or businesses and their respective Representatives and financing sources and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or Persons making such Diamond Acquisition Proposal and their respective Representatives and financing sources and potential purchasers of a portion of Diamond's assets or businesses and their respective Representatives and financing sources; provided that the aggregate number of potential purchasers of a portion of Diamond's assets or businesses to whom information may be furnished under clause (A) and/or who may be permitted to participate in discussions or negotiations under clause (B) shall not exceed six (6); provided further that (x) Diamond will not, and will not allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to any Person or Persons making such Diamond Acquisition Proposal, their respective Representatives or sources of financing unless the Person or Persons making the Diamond Acquisition Proposal enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and Diamond will not, and will not allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to any potential purchaser of a portion of Diamond's assets or businesses or their respective Representatives or financing sources unless the potential purchaser enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) Diamond will promptly provide to Ruby any non-public information concerning Diamond or the Diamond Subsidiaries provided to such Person or Persons making such Diamond Acquisition Proposal, any potential purchaser of a portion of Diamond's assets or businesses or their respective Representatives or financing sources that was not previously provided to Ruby. Diamond shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Ruby in the event it receives a Diamond Acquisition Proposal or any request or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Diamond Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons, including by notifying Ruby of the identity of the Person or Persons making such Diamond Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and the material terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Diamond shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify Ruby if it determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning a Diamond Acquisition Proposal. Diamond shall inform Ruby on a prompt and current basis of any material change in the material terms or conditions of a Diamond Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that any change in price shall be deemed to be a material change in a material term) and promptly provide Ruby with copies of any written Diamond Acquisition Proposals received by Diamond. Promptly upon determination by the Diamond Board of Directors that a Diamond Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 7.1(h), Diamond shall deliver to Ruby a written notice advising Ruby that the Diamond Board of Directors has so determined, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Acquisition Proposal (including the terms of the consideration that the holders of shares of Diamond Common Stock will receive per share of Diamond Common Stock and including any written agreement providing for a Superior Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Acquisition Proposal). (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and in addition to the rights of the Diamond Board of Directors under Section 5.2(b), if, at any time 43
prior to obtaining the Diamond Stockholder Approval, Diamond receives a Diamond Acquisition Proposal which the Diamond Board of Directors concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Acquisition Proposal, the Diamond Board of Directors may (x) recommend the Diamond Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Diamond and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Acquisition Proposal if the Diamond Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take this action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Diamond may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless Diamond is in compliance in all material respects with this Section 5.3 and prior to or concurrently with such termination Diamond pays the Break-Up Fee payable pursuant to Section 7.1(h); and the Diamond Board of Directors may not recommend a Superior Acquisition Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless Diamond shall have provided prior written notice ("Superior Proposal Notice") to Ruby, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of its intention to recommend, or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to, a Superior Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that delivering a Superior Proposal Notice, or disclosure thereof, shall not entitle Ruby to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i)-(iv)); provided, further, that in the event of any material change to the material terms of a Superior Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that a change in price shall be deemed to be a material change to a material term), the Diamond Board of Directors shall deliver to Ruby a written notice specifying the material terms and conditions of such modified Superior Acquisition Proposal (including the terms of the consideration that the holders of shares of Diamond Common Stock will receive and including any written agreement providing for a Superior Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Acquisition Proposal), and if the three (3) Business Day period referenced above would otherwise expire within forty-eight (48) hours after delivery of such notice, such period shall be extended until forty-eight (48) hours from delivery of the notice. To the extent that Ruby proposes changes to the terms of this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day period referred to above (as extended), Diamond shall negotiate in good faith with Ruby with respect to such changes during such period. (d) As used in this Agreement, the term: (i) "Diamond Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal for any of the following (other than any offer proposed by Ruby or any of its Affiliates effected pursuant to this Agreement): any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or similar transaction, whether effected in a single transaction or series of related transactions, which would result in the offeror or any of its Affiliates owning or controlling (A) 20% or more of the consolidated gross assets of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding equity securities of Diamond or if Diamond is not the surviving entity in such a transaction, the surviving entity of such transaction, or, if applicable, the ultimate parent of such surviving entity; 44
(ii) "Superior Acquisition Proposal" means a bona fide written Diamond Acquisition Proposal, which proposal was not the result of a breach of this Section 5.3 (or a result of actions taken by any director of Diamond that would have constituted a breach of Section 5.3(a) if such actions had been taken by an officer of Diamond), made by a Third Party on terms that a majority of the Diamond Board of Directors determines in their good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) (x) would, if consummated, be more favorable to the holders of Diamond Common Stock from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account any changes proposed by Ruby to the terms of this Agreement in response to a Diamond Acquisition Proposal) and (y) and is reasonably likely to be completed; provided that, for the purposes of this definition of "Superior Acquisition Proposal", the term Diamond Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.3(d)(i), except that the reference to "20% or more" in the definition of "Diamond Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "60% or more"; and (iii) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that contains provisions (including standstill provisions) that are no less favorable in all material respects to Diamond than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may include provisions (other than any standstill or similar provision) that are less favorable in all material respects to Diamond than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement so long as Diamond offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently with execution of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to include substantially similar provisions for the benefit of Ruby. (e) Nothing contained in Section 5.2, this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit Diamond from (1) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law, including Rule 10b-5, Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) taking any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders it to take; provided that Diamond shall not make any disclosure to stockholders or take any action that constitutes a Recommendation Withdrawal other than in compliance with Section 5.2(b). Section 5.4 Access to Information; Cooperation. (a) Upon reasonable advance notice, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Diamond shall, and shall cause each of the Diamond Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives to, (i) give Ruby, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice during the period prior to the Effective Time to the offices, properties, books and records (including all Tax Returns and other Tax-related information) of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries; (ii) furnish to Ruby, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives such financial and operating data and other information (including Tax Returns and other Tax-related information) relating to Diamond, the Diamond Subsidiaries and their respective operations as such Persons may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel and financial 45
advisors of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries to cooperate with Ruby, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives in their reasonable investigation of the business of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such access shall only be provided to the extent that such access would not subject any of the properties of Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries to invasive physical testing or violate applicable Laws or the terms of any Contract to which Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective assets are subject; provided further, however, that to the extent that Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries is restricted in or prohibited from providing any such access to any documents or data pursuant to any such Contract for the benefit of any Third Party, each of Diamond and any such Diamond Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts, at Ruby's expense, to obtain any approval, consent or waiver with respect to such Contract that is necessary to provide such access to Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing or Section 5.5, neither Ruby nor Diamond shall be required to provide to the other any information which Ruby or Diamond, as the case may be, reasonably believes is competitively sensitive information. In addition, either Ruby or Diamond may designate any competitively sensitive information provided to the other under this Agreement as "outside counsel only." Such information shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient. (b) Any information relating to Diamond or the Diamond Subsidiaries made available pursuant to this Section 5.4, shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Neither Ruby nor Merger Sub shall, and Ruby and Merger Sub shall cause each of their respective Representatives not to, use any information acquired pursuant to this Section 5.4 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify or limit any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. Section 5.5 Commitment to Closing. (a) Each of Ruby and Diamond shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly as practicable (subject to Sections 5.2, 5.3 and this Section 5.5) after the date of this Agreement (and, in this case, to proceed with the Merger as expeditiously as possible). Without limiting the foregoing, none of the parties shall, (i) directly or indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any business or collection of assets of any kind or nature if doing so would reasonably be expected to materially delay consummation of the Merger, (ii) directly or indirectly, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license) any other assets of any kind or nature if, to the Knowledge of that party, doing so would reasonably be expected to materially delay consummation of the Merger or (iii) take any action of any kind or nature if, to the Knowledge of that party, doing so would reasonably be expected to prevent consummation of the Merger. Each of Ruby and Diamond undertakes and agrees to prepare and file as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (i) a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United 46
States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and (ii) all other necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests and other documents with other Governmental Entities relating to the Merger required by any applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Ruby shall take, and Diamond shall use its best efforts to take, any and all actions necessary to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing from occurring on or before the Termination Date (for the avoidance of doubt, each reference to "Termination Date" in this Section 5.5 shall be interpreted so as to give effect to any extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 7.1(b)); (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory Law so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the Termination Date; and (iii) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable Law and the receipt of any other approvals from any Governmental Entity necessary for the consummation of the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur no later than the Termination Date; provided that (1) the foregoing shall not be interpreted to prevent Ruby from engaging in litigation, including to prevent the imposition by any Governmental Entity of any requirement (A) that a material business, product line or asset, including patents and other intellectual property, of Ruby, Diamond or their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries be sold, divested, disposed of, licensed or held separate or (B) that Ruby, Diamond or their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries materially limit their freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, any material business, product line or asset, including patents and other intellectual property, of Ruby, Diamond or their respective Subsidiaries, and (2) Ruby shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct and control any such litigation referred to in clause (1) of this proviso, with counsel of its own choosing, and Diamond shall reasonably cooperate with Ruby with respect thereto, in each case so long as Ruby complies with its obligations under this Section 5.5(a), including, for the avoidance of doubt, subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this sentence; provided, further that, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.5 shall not be construed to require Diamond to take or consent to any action if that action is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, Ruby shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for a waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, and (y) no other matter relating to any Regulatory Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Termination Date or result in any injunction or other Order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity preventing the consummation of the Merger becoming final and nonappealable. (b) Each of Ruby and Diamond shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection with Regulatory Law matters, and (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties. (c) In addition, each of Ruby and Diamond shall, subject to applicable Law and except as prohibited by any applicable representative of any applicable Governmental 47
Entity, (i) promptly notify and apprise the other party of (and, if in writing, supply the other party with) any communication (or other correspondence or other memoranda) to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity, and, permit the other party to review in advance, and accept all of the other party's reasonable comments in connection with, any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing, unless, in the case of a communication by Ruby, Ruby reasonably objects to any such comments from Diamond; and (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion or communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Section 5.6 Tax Matters. (a) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the Transaction, including the receipt of the Unit Consideration in exchange for each Unit Electing Diamond Share, to qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code, and shall not take (or cause to be taken), agree to take, or fail to take any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, if taking (or causing to be taken), agreeing to take or failing to take, as the case may be, such action would reasonably be expected to cause the Transaction not to so qualify; provided, however, that (i) no party shall be required to take (or cause its Subsidiaries to take), agree to take, or fail to take any action, if taking (or causing to be taken), agreeing to take or failing to take, as the case may be, such action in any way modifies this Agreement, the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date, without regard to any amendment thereto), the Editorial Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Murdoch Family Agreement and (ii) no party shall be treated as having violated this covenant as a result of taking (or causing any of its Subsidiaries to take) any specific action expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date, without regard to any amendment thereto), the Editorial Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Murdoch Family Agreement (it being understood that (A) effecting a merger of Ruby Newco, on the terms on which such merger is permitted under Section 5.1(g) of the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date, without regard to any amendment thereto), in compliance with and pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1(g) of the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement (as in effect on the Closing Date, without regard to any amendment thereto), shall not be considered to be a violation of this covenant and (B) an action shall not be treated as a specific action expressly provided for in the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement solely by reason of the general grants of power or authority set forth in Sections 2.3 and 2.6 of the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement, or other similar general grants of power or authority, if any, contained in the Ruby Newco Operating Agreement). (b) Ruby or Ruby Newco has made or will make a timely election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 to have Ruby Newco classified, effective as of the date on which Ruby Newco was formed, as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such election shall not be revoked for so long as there remain outstanding any Ruby Newco Class B Units. 48
(c) Each of Ruby, Merger Sub, Ruby Newco and Diamond shall use its reasonable best efforts to execute the letters of representation substantially in a form to be mutually agreed upon by Ruby and Diamond as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (the "Representation Letters"). (d) If counsel renders the tax opinion referred to in Section 6.3(d), then, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as that term is defined in section 1313(a) of the Code), (i) Ruby, Diamond and Ruby Newco shall report the Transaction, including the receipt of the Unit Consideration in exchange for each Unit Electing Diamond Share, for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and shall not treat the Ruby Newco Class B Units as "nonqualified preferred stock" within the meaning of Section 351(g) of the Code and (ii) none of Ruby, Diamond or Ruby Newco shall take a position on any Tax Return, or take any Tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the Transaction, including the receipt of the Unit Consideration in exchange for each Unit Electing Diamond Share, qualifying as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code or the Ruby Newco Class B Units not constituting "nonqualified preferred stock" within the meaning of Section 351(g) of the Code. (e) Ruby shall, with Diamond's good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than any such Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the holders of Diamond Common Stock under applicable Law (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer and Gains Taxes"). From and after the Effective Time, Ruby shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes (other than any such Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the holders of Diamond Common Stock under applicable Law or as set forth in Section 2.3(c)) without deductions withheld from the Merger Consideration. Section 5.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release approved in advance by Ruby and Diamond and thereafter Diamond and Ruby shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any press release or make any public statement or filing relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to any disclosure of any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (i) which Ruby or Diamond deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a publicly owned company, including without limitation to securities analysts and institutional investors and in press interviews; and (ii) in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 49
Section 5.8 Employee Arrangements. (a) Following the Effective Time, Ruby shall honor and perform, or cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform, all obligations of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries under the Diamond Employee Benefit Plans. Ruby shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and perform, without any modification that adversely affects the benefits of participants (other than as required by applicable Law), each severance, termination, separation or similar agreement, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Diamond Severance Plan") for no less than two (2) years immediately following the Closing Date or for such longer period as is provided in the Diamond Severance Plan. For no less than two (2) years immediately following the Closing Date or such later time as Ruby in its sole discretion shall determine in accordance with the terms of the applicable Diamond Employee Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement, obligations of the Surviving Corporation), Ruby shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and provide, without any modification that adversely affects the benefits of participants (other than as required by applicable Law), the post-retirement and post-termination benefits (including, but not limited to, eligibility requirements) under the health care plans of Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary. Thereafter, Ruby shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each former employee of Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary post-retirement and post-termination health care benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated former employees of the applicable business unit of Ruby and its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries). Following the Effective Time, Ruby shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain and perform, without any modification that adversely affects the benefits of participants (other than as required by applicable Law), the Diamond Executive Annual Incentive Plan, as amended, including, without limitation, with respect to the 2007 Annual Incentive Plan Highlights, until the date on which payments are made with respect to such plan for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8(a), until December 31, 2008 or such later time as Ruby in its sole discretion shall determine in accordance with the terms of the applicable Diamond Employee Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement, Ruby shall provide, or Ruby shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each individual employed by Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary immediately prior to Closing base salary and wages, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to such employees immediately before the Closing, and thereafter shall provide such employees with base salary and wages, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of the applicable business unit of Ruby and its Subsidiaries. The foregoing shall in no way limit Ruby's, Diamond's and the Surviving Corporation's obligation to honor all of their obligations to employees and former employees of Diamond, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries under collectively bargained and similar labor agreements and otherwise to comply with applicable labor Laws. (b) From and after the Effective Time, Ruby shall treat, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to treat, the service with Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries prior to Closing as service rendered to Ruby for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit 50
accrual under any health, welfare (including vacation and severance) or defined contribution benefit plan maintained by Ruby in which Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries' employees participate. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that any individual employed by Diamond or any Diamond Subsidiary immediately prior to Closing participates in any health or welfare benefit plan of Ruby or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, Ruby shall cause (x) any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations to be waived and (y) any deductibles or co-payments paid by such employee under any of Diamond's or the Diamond Subsidiaries' health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be credited towards deductibles or co-payments, as applicable, under the health or welfare benefit plans of Ruby and the Ruby Subsidiaries. Ruby will use reasonable efforts to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result. (c) On or before the earlier of the Closing Date or December 31, 2007, Diamond shall, in consultation with Ruby, use its reasonable best efforts to amend each Diamond Employee Benefit Plan to the extent necessary to cause the Diamond Employee Benefit Plans to comply with Section 409A of the Code in a manner that does not increase benefit levels or provide indemnification or gross-up payments for Taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code under the Diamond Employee Benefit Plans. (d) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Diamond and Ruby shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Diamond Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Diamond Common Stock) or acquisitions of Ruby A Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Ruby A Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the guidance provided by the SEC. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and except to the extent prohibited by Law or as set forth in Section 5.8(e) of the Diamond Disclosure Letter, on or prior to the Closing Date, Diamond shall, and shall require the Diamond Subsidiaries to: (i) consult with Ruby, the Ruby Subsidiaries and/or their counsel on a regular basis concerning collective bargaining negotiations with any labor organization; (ii) provide Ruby, the Ruby Subsidiaries and/or their counsel with access to all information relating to such negotiations; (iii) allow Ruby, the Ruby Subsidiaries and/or their counsel to be involved in developing and presenting contract proposals and counter-proposals in such negotiations; (iv) present any and all proposals or counterproposals as directed by Ruby, the Ruby Subsidiaries and/or their counsel in such negotiations (provided that Diamond or the Diamond Subsidiaries may condition any such proposal or counter-proposal on the Closing); (v) not present any proposals or counterproposals in such negotiations without the prior written consent of Ruby (which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld or delayed); and (vi) not accept any proposals or counterproposals in such negotiations without the prior written consent of Ruby (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that nothing in this 51
Section 5.8(e) shall be interpreted to interfere with Diamond's or the Diamond Subsidiaries' duty to bargain in good faith under the NLRA or other similar foreign, state or local Law. (f) Prior to the Closing Date, Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries, as applicable, will use reasonable best efforts to engage in any effects or the analogous type of bargaining, if any, required in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with any labor union, labor organization or works council as may be required by Law, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.9 Director and Officer Liability. (a) At all times after the consummation of the Merger until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Ruby shall cause, including by providing financial assistance if necessary, the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of Diamond and the Diamond Subsidiaries or any fiduciaries under any Diamond Employee Benefit Plan (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. (b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Ruby shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i) maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Diamond (the "Current Insurance") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (this 300%, the "Maximum Premium"), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current Insurance (a "Reporting Tail Endorsement") and maintain this endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If Diamond's existing insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during this six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Ruby shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of this period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons than Diamond's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Diamond may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that Diamond shall not pay more than six (6) times the Maximum Premium for this Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, provided that Ruby causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain this Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, Ruby shall be relieved from its obligations under the preceding two sentences of this Section 5.9(b). (c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and 52
exculpation of present and former directors and officers on the same basis as set forth in the Diamond Certificate of Incorporation and the Diamond Bylaws in effect on the date hereof. For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Ruby shall cause the Diamond Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Persons, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time under Delaware Law, which provisions shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Persons' indemnification rights thereunder. (d) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Ruby shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay on an as-incurred basis the fees and expenses of an Indemnified Person (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any Litigation or investigation that is the subject of the right to indemnification, upon ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation of a request therefor, provided that an Indemnified Person shall undertake in writing to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable order, that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. The Indemnified Person shall be entitled to control the defense of any Litigation or investigation with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and Ruby and the Diamond Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense thereof; provided, however, that Ruby and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries. (f) This Section 5.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Ruby and the Surviving Corporation. Each Indemnified Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.9, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.9. If any Indemnified Person makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.9 that is denied by Ruby and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification, then Ruby or the Surviving Corporation shall pay this Indemnified Person's costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Indemnitors. (g) If Ruby, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or 53
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Ruby or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. Section 5.10 Notices of Certain Events. Each of Diamond and Ruby shall promptly notify the other after receiving or becoming aware: (a) of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of that Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the review, clearance or approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c) of any Litigation or investigation commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise involving Diamond or any of the Diamond Subsidiaries or Ruby or any of the Ruby Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) of any matter (including a breach of covenant or a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement) that could reasonably lead to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions to Closing in Article VI. Failure to comply with this Section 5.10 shall not result in the failure of any condition under Article VII to be satisfied, unless such condition would have otherwise been satisfied but for such failure to comply with this Section 5.10. Section 5.11 Editorial Agreement; Special Committee. (a) Effective as of the Closing, Ruby and Diamond shall (i) adopt, execute and deliver the Editorial Agreement and (ii) Ruby shall establish the special committee contemplated by the Editorial Agreement (the "Special Committee") and appoint as the initial members of the Special Committee the persons set forth on Schedule A to the Editorial Agreement (or, if any of such persons is unable to serve as a member of the Special Committee as of the Closing, a replacement member appointed in accordance with the terms of the Editorial Agreement) (the "Initial Committee Members"). From and after the Effective Time, Ruby and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to at all times maintain the Special Committee in accordance with the Editorial Agreement and otherwise comply in all respects with the Editorial Agreement. (b) This Section 5.11 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Special Committee and the members from time to time of the Special Committee and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Ruby and the Surviving Corporation. The Special Committee and the members from time to time of the Special 54
Committee shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.11 and the Editorial Agreement, and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 5.11 and the Editorial Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Editorial Agreement, including by obtaining injunctive or equitable relief. Section 5.12 Stockholder Litigation.

Diamond shall give Ruby the opportunity to consult with Diamond regarding the defense or settlement of any such Litigation, shall give due consideration to Ruby's advice with respect to such Litigation and shall not settle any such Litigation without the prior written consent of Ruby (not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In addition, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, except as required by Law, Diamond shall not voluntarily cooperate with any Third Party that may hereafter seek to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall cooperate with Ruby to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

By either Ruby or Diamond, if any Order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement resulted in the application or imposition of such injunction or other Order; (f) No Stockholder Approval. By either Ruby or Diamond, if at the Diamond Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement) the stockholders of Diamond shall have voted with respect to the Merger and the Diamond Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained; (g) Recommendation Withdrawal.

(f) Diamond acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Ruby would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Diamond fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.2 and, in order to obtain such payment, Ruby commences a suit which results in a judgment against Diamond for the amount 62
set forth in this Section 7.2, Diamond shall pay to Ruby its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

(a)       The Company hereby establishes a stand-alone special committee (the "
Special Committee
") to oversee and enforce compliance by the Company and Dow Jones and their Affiliates with the terms of this Agreement and to perform the obligation and undertake its responsibilities and rights hereunder. The Special Committee shall have perpetual existence. For the avoidance of doubt, the Special Committee is a special committee of the Company and is not a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or Dow Jones.
 
(a)       The Special Committee shall consist of five (5) members ("
Members
") who are distinguished community or journalistic leaders and who are independent of the Company, Dow Jones, the Murdoch family, the Bancroft family and their respective Affiliates (as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As used in this Agreement, the term "independent" shall refer to persons who, in the sole judgment of the Special Committee, are able to consider and evaluate objectively any issue that comes before the Special Committee and whose judgment is not impaired by any interest in or relationship with the Company, Dow Jones, the Murdoch family, the Bancroft family or their respective Affiliates. Employees, directors and consultants of the Company, Dow Jones or their respective Affiliates shall be deemed not to be independent. Any Member shall promptly report to all of the other Members any change in his or her circumstances which may reasonably be expected to bear on the determination of his or her status as independent (as defined herein).
(b)       The Members of the Special Committee shall be divided into three classes. The first class shall consist of one Member and the second and third classes shall consist of two Members. The initial term of the first class shall expire on December 31, 2012; the initial term of the second class shall expire on December 31, 2013; the initial term of the third class shall expire on December 31, 2014. Upon the expiration of the term of any class, a new term of the class shall commence, and this term shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of this term.

(c)       Upon the expiration of the term of a class, a majority of the remaining Members of the Special Committee shall appoint or reappoint an individual or individuals, as applicable, selected by the Special Committee as a Member or Members, as applicable, of the class for the new term then commencing. Any appointment or reappointment shall be subject to the approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any proposed appointment or reappointment shall be deemed to be approved by the Company if no written objection to the appointment or reappointment is received from the Company by the Special Committee within ten (10) business days following the Company's receipt from the Special Committee of written notice of the proposed appointment or reappointment. Subject to the foregoing sentence, a Member may be reappointed to the Special Committee upon the expiration of the term of his or her class.

(d)       The Special Committee shall appoint an individual selected by a majority of the remaining Members of the Special Committee as a Member to fill any vacancy in any class of the Special Committee resulting from any resignation, death or removal of a Member.

Any proposed appointment shall be deemed to be approved by the Company if no written objection to the appointment is received from the Company by the Special Committee within ten (10) business days following the Company's receipt from the Special Committee of notice of the proposed appointment. Any Member appointed in accordance with the foregoing shall be a Member of the class of the Special Committee in which the vacancy existed.
(e)       A Member may resign from the Special Committee by submitting a letter to the Chairman of the Special Committee, who will confirm receipt in writing and notify the Special Committee of this resignation. In the event that the Chairman resigns, the Chairman shall submit a letter of resignation to each of the remaining Members, any one of who shall confirm receipt in writing. A resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein and, if no time is specified, at the time of its receipt by the Chairman or the remaining Members, as applicable. A Member shall resign forthwith if his or her circumstances change such that the Member ceases to be (or the other Members determine that the Member ceases to be) independent (as defined herein).
(f)        A Member may be removed from the Special Committee if determined by the unanimous vote of the other Special Committee Members that (x) he or she has materially failed to fulfill his or her responsibilities as a Member (it being acknowledged and agreed that any substantive dispute over decision-making under this Agreement shall not constitute such a failure), or (y) such Member has ceased to be independent (as defined herein);
provided
,
however

each of
the Member and the Company shall have been given the opportunity to address the Special Committee prior to the Special Committee taking this action. A Member may also be removed from the Special Committee by determination of a majority of the other Members for "Cause." For purposes of this paragraph 1.2(f), "Cause" shall mean a plea of guilty or
nolo contendere
to, or nonappealable conviction of, a felony on the part of a Member, which conviction or plea, of the action or failure to act giving rise to the conviction or plea a majority of the other Members determine causes or caused, or is reasonably like to cause, material damage to the reputation of the Company, Dow Jones or the Special Committee.

DOW JONES & COMPANY AND NEWS CORPORATION
ENTER INTO DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT
 
Bancroft Family Members Holding Approximately 37% of Dow Jones' Voting Power
Agree to Support the Transaction
 
NEW YORK (August 1, 2007)
( Dow Jones & Company (NYSE: DJ) and News Corporation (NYSE: NWS, NWS.A; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) announced today that they have signed a definitive merger agreement under which News Corporation will acquire Dow Jones in a transaction valued at approximately $5.6 billion.
Under the terms of the agreement, which was approved by both companies' boards of directors, Dow Jones stockholders will be entitled to receive $60 in cash for each share of common stock and Class B common stock that they own. Certain members of the Bancroft family and the trustees of trusts for their benefit who collectively own approximately 37% of Dow Jones' voting stock have agreed to vote to approve the transaction. In addition, the parties
 
1
 
 
have agreed on the terms of an editorial agreement that provides for the establishment of a five-member, special committee with the objective of assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity and independence of Dow Jones' publications and services. The initial members of the special committee will be Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jennifer Dunn, Jack Fuller and Nicholas Negroponte.
The merger agreement provides that up to 250 holders of record and not more than 10% of the shares of Dow Jones may elect to have their shares of Dow Jones equity converted into a number of Class B units of Newco LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of News Corporation (each unit of which will be exchangeable for one share of Class A common stock of News Corporation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Newco LLC operating agreement). The number of Class B units of Newco LLC issuable in exchange for each share of Dow Jones common stock will be based on the exchange ratio in the merger agreement, which is equal to the number of shares of News Corporation's Class A common stock with a value of $60 based on the volume weighted average trading price of a share of Class A common stock of News Corporation over the five trading days ending on the trading day prior to the closing of the merger. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to Dow Jones stockholders to the extent they receive Newco LLC Class B units for their Dow Jones shares.
The parties have also agreed that, upon closing of the merger, News Corporation will appoint a member of the Bancroft family or another mutually acceptable person to the News Corporation board of directors.
Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of News Corporation, said, "I am deeply gratified at the level of support we have received from the Bancroft family and its trustees. Given the Bancrofts' long and distinguished history as custodians of Dow Jones, we
 
2
 
 
appreciate how difficult this decision was for some family members. I want to offer the Bancrofts my thanks, and an assurance that our company and my family will be equally strong custodians."
Richard F. Zannino, Chief Executive Officer of Dow Jones, said, "News Corporation's proposal reflects the vitality and uniqueness of Dow Jones and its world-class journalism, brands, businesses and people. The transaction will deliver significant returns to our shareholders. It will also build on our recent, industry-leading earnings growth and make our company and journalism even stronger as our strengths are leveraged across News Corp.'s powerful global distribution and marketing platforms for the benefit of our readers and other customers. On behalf of all of my colleagues at Dow Jones, I would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Bancroft family for their years of steadfast support for the journalistic excellence of Dow Jones. We look forward to continuing their legacy."
M. Peter McPherson, Chairman of the Board of Dow Jones, said, "Having thoroughly reviewed News Corporation's proposal, the Dow Jones Board has overwhelmingly voted to approve the definitive merger agreement.  This decision has been difficult and emotional for a great many people because of the long history of this great institution. The board has concluded, with a great deal of family support, that the proposal provides outstanding financial value and
 
provides excellent opportunities to
the extraordinary Dow Jones franchise. Also, we wish to thank the Bancroft family for their years of faithful stewardship. The editorial independence agreement proposed by the Bancroft family is a strong agreement about which all can be pleased."  
Mr. Murdoch added, "Dow Jones is a vibrant company and one of the world's greatest media franchises, with a portfolio of brands that has no equal in financial information and
 
3
 
 
business journalism. In combination with News Corporation's assets,
The Wall Street Journal
and the other Dow Jones operations will be even more formidable competitors as we profitably extend their invaluable information across our print, broadcast and digital platforms around the world."
The merger, which is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter, is subject to approval by Dow Jones stockholders, execution and delivery by the parties of the editorial agreement, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as financial advisor to Dow Jones and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP provided legal counsel to Dow Jones. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP provided legal counsel to the non-family members of Dow Jones' board of directors. Merrill Lynch & Co. acted as financial advisor to certain trusts for the benefit of the Bancroft family. Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz provided legal counsel to the Bancroft family.
JPMorgan, Allen & Company and Centerview Partners served as financial advisors to News Corporation, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Hogan & Hartson LLP provided legal counsel to News Corporation.
This press release and the related Agreement and Plan of Merger will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the requirements of U.S. securities laws.
