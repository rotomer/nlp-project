ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT
On February 16, 2011, News America Incorporated ("News America"), a subsidiary of News Corporation, a Delaware corporation, (the "Company"), closed the private placement of $1 billion of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 at the issue price of 99.380% (the "4.50% Notes") and $1.5 billion of 6.15% Senior Notes due 2041 at the issue price of 99.485% (the "6.15% Notes," and together with the 4.50% Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were sold within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
On February 16, 2011, News America amended and restated the indenture dated as of August 25, 2009 among News America, the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (as amended and restated, the "Indenture"). The Notes were sold pursuant to the Indenture.
Repayment of the Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event specified in the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, News America will be required to make an offer to purchase each series of Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of repurchase. Under the Indenture, a change of control triggering event means a change of control and a rating decline. A "change of control" means the occurrence of the following: any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) other than the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of either the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or the Murdoch Family (as defined in the Indenture), becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally for the election of directors. A "rating decline" is defined as the occurrence of the following on, or within 90 days after, the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a change of control or (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the intention by the Company to effect a change of control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities (as defined in the Indenture) is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies), (a) in the event the Securities are rated by either rating agency on the rating date as investment grade, the rating of the Securities shall be reduced so that the Securities are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies, or (b) in the event the Securities are rated below investment grade by both rating agencies on the rating date, the rating of the Securities by both rating agencies shall be decreased by one or more gradations (including gradations within rating categories as well as between rating categories).
Repayment of the Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of events of default specified in the Indenture. The following events are defaults under the Indenture: (a) failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) the applicable series of Notes when due; (b) failure to pay any interest installment on the applicable series of Notes when due, if such failure continues for 30 days; (c) failure to pay the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of the applicable series of notes; (d) failure of News America, the Company or any guarantor to perform any other covenant under the Indenture (other than a covenant included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than the Notes), which continues for 90 days after written notice; and (e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of News America, the Company or any significant subsidiary of the Company.
Each series of the Notes is redeemable, as a whole or in part, at News America's option, at any time or from time to time, upon mailed notice to the registered address of each holder of such series of Notes at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the series of Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined in the Notes) on such series of Notes discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Notes) plus 15 basis points with respect to the 4.50% Notes and at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points with respect to the 6.15% Notes. Accrued interest will be paid to the date of the redemption.
The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's and News America's ability, and the ability of the Company's subsidiaries, to create liens and engage in a merger, sale or consolidation transaction. All of the covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions under the Indenture. The Indenture does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.
The foregoing summary of the terms of the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Indenture (including the form of global note thereunder). A copy of the Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1, and is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or applicable exemptions from these registration requirements.
In connection with the offering of the Notes, on February 16, 2011, News America, the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the initial purchasers, entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). The Registration Rights Agreement provides that unless the exchange offer would not be permitted by applicable law or the policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), News America will (i) file the exchange offer registration statement with the Commission on or prior to 90 days after the Notes were originally issued (the "Issue Date"), (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to have the exchange offer registration statement declared effective by the Commission on or prior to 180 days after the Issue Date, (iii) commence the exchange offer and use its reasonable best efforts to issue, on or prior to 225 days after the Issue Date, exchange notes, in exchange for all Notes tendered prior thereto in the exchange offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, News America may be required to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes.
If (i) News America fails to file any of the registration statements required by the Registration Rights Agreement on or before the date specified for such filing, (ii) any of such registration statements is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness (the "Effectiveness Target Date"), (iii) the exchange offer is required to be consummated under the Registration Rights Agreement and News America fails to issue exchange notes in exchange for all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn in the exchange offer within 45 days of the Effectiveness Target Date with respect to the exchange offer registration statement, or (iv) the shelf registration statement or the exchange offer registration statement is declared effective but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with the exchange offer or resales of registrable securities, as the case may be, during the periods specified in the Registration Rights Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a "Registration Default"), then News America shall pay as liquidated damages additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Notes as to which the Registration Default exists as set forth herein. If a Registration Default exists with respect to the notes of a series, the interest rate on such registrable securities of such series will increase, with respect to the first 90 day period (or portion thereof) while a Registration Default is continuing immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default, 0.25% per annum. The amount of liquidated damages will increase by an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90 day period (or portion thereof) while a Registration Default is continuing until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum rate of Additional Interest of 1.00% per annum. Following the cure of the Registration Default, Additional Interest as a result of the Registration Default shall cease to accrue (but any accrued amount shall be payable) and the interest rate on the applicable Notes will revert to the original rate if no other Registration Default has occurred and is continuing.

Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgements of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Bearer Securities held by any Person, and the date of his holding the same, may be proved by the production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary, wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory.

deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this clause.
(e) The ownership of Registered Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
(f) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company or the Guarantor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
(g) Whenever for purposes of any Act to be taken hereunder by the Holders of a series of Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency (or any currency unit), the principal amount of Securities is required to be determined, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities shall be deemed to be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such principal amount on the basis of the spot rate of exchange for such Foreign Currency or such currency unit as determined by the Company or by an authorized exchange rate agent and evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer's Certificate as of the date taking of such Act by the Holders of the requisite percentage in principal amount of the Securities is evidenced to the Trustee.

If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.

If it is impossible or, in the opinion of the Trustee, impracticable to give any notice by publication in the manner herein required, then such publication in lieu thereof as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient publication of such notice.

Section 3.03 .
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Officer of the Company. The Coupons, if any, shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Officer of the Company, attested by its Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or its Treasurer or one of its Assistant Treasurers. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities (and Coupons, if any) may be manual or facsimile.
 
The Guarantee(s) shall be executed on behalf of Guarantor by an Officer of the Guarantor. The signature of any such Officer on the Guarantee may be manual or facsimile.
Securities (and Coupons, if any) and Guarantees bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper Officers of NAI or News Corporation shall bind NAI and such Guarantor, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities (and Coupons, if any) or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities (and Coupons, if any).
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities (with or without Coupons) of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 2.01 and 3.01, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be provided with, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that,
(a) if established pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.01, the form of such Securities, Guarantees and Coupons, if any, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(b) if established pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.01, the terms of such Securities, Guarantees and Coupons, if any, have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
(c) such Securities, and the Guarantees endorsed thereon together with Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver such Securities if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders or would adversely affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate Securities denominated in a coin or currency (or unit including a coin or currency) other than that of the United States of America if the Trustee reasonably determines that such Securities impose duties or obligations on the Trustee which the Trustee is not able or reasonably willing to accept; provided that the Trustee, upon a Company Request, will resign as Trustee with respect to Securities of any series as to which such a determination is made, prior to the issuance of such Securities, and will comply
 
with the request of the Company to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture appointing a successor Trustee pursuant to Section 8.01.
If all of the Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at the same time, then the documents required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 3.03 must be delivered only once, prior to the authentication and delivery of the first Security of such series; provided, however, that any subsequent request by the Company to the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series upon original issuance shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that, as of the date of such request, the statements made in the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall be true and correct as if made on such date.
If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in global form, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 3.03 and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities in global form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by such global Security or Securities, (ii) shall be registered, if in registered form, in the name of the Depositary for such Book-Entry Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in certificated form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary" or to such other effect as the Depositary and the Trustee may agree.
Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01 for a Book-Entry Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if the Depositary is so registered. Each Depositary shall enter into an agreement with the Trustee governing their respective duties and rights with regard to Book-Entry Securities.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, except that each Bearer Security, including any Bearer Security in global form, shall be dated as of the date specified as contemplated by Section 3.01.
No Security or Coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Except as permitted by Section 3.06 or 3.07, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant Coupons for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled.
Section 3.04 .
Temporary Securities
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor and form, with or without Coupons of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities and Coupons, if any.
Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form, each of which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions thereof, if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company pursuant to Section 9.05 in a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided, further, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security unless the Trustee shall have received from the person entitled to receive the definitive Bearer Security a certificate substantially in the form approved in the Board Resolutions relating thereto and such delivery shall occur only outside the United States. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the payment of interest on Bearer Securities in temporary form.
Section 3.05 .
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 9.05 in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 9.05 in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series (except a Book-Entry Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of such series) may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
 
principal amount, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Registered Securities may not be exchanged for Bearer Securities.
At the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Securities of such series are issuable in registered form) or Bearer Securities (if Bearer Securities of such series are issuable in more than one denomination and such exchanges are permitted by such series) of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.05, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in certificated form, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 3.03, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 3.01(t) shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities of such series and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order
 
for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in certificated form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities in global form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more global Securities shall no longer be represented by such global Security or Securities. In such event the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Securities of such series of like tenor, shall authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in certificated form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Security or Securities in global form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form.
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a global Security of such series in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in certificated form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge:
(a) to each Person specified by such Depositary, a new certificated Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the global Security; and
(b) to such Depositary, a new global Security of like tenor in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered global Security and the aggregate principal amount of certificated Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities in certificated form in authorized denominations.
Upon the exchange of a global Security for Securities in certificated form, such global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Unless expressly provided with respect to the Securities of any series that such Security may be exchanged for Bearer Securities, Securities issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Book-Entry Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04 or 8.06 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series for a period of 15 days before the selection of any Securities of that series for redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption.
Section 3.06 .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If any mutilated Security or Security with a mutilated Coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or Security with a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and the Guarantor and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons, if any, appertaining to the destroyed, lost or stolen Security.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security or Coupon, pay such Security or Coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of and any premium or interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.05, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
 
in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series with its Guarantees and Coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and Guarantor with respect thereto, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its Coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon, shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their Guarantees and Coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or Coupons.
Section 3.07 .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01, Interest on any Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
(a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such Series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the
 
Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
(b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
At the option of the Company, interest on Registered Securities of any series that bear interest may be paid (i) by mailing a check to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer to an account maintained by the person entitled thereto as specified in the applicable Security Register.
Notwithstanding the above, except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, a Holder of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of the same series having the same Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to receive payments of interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received by the Trustee on or before the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security or Coupon, if any, delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security or Coupon, if any, shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security or Coupon.
Section 3.08 .
Persons Deemed Owners
Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or Coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bearer Security or Coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 3.09 .

Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities and Coupons so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities or Coupons shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities or Coupons cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and Coupons shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with the Trustee's policy of disposal of cancelled securities or shall be delivered to the Company upon the Company's written request.
Section 3.10 .

Section 3.11 .
CUSIP Numbers
The Company, in issuing the Securities, may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so used by the Company, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.
Section 4.01 .
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to Securities of any series (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of such series and replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated Securities of such series herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series, when
(a) either
(i) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered and all Coupons appertaining thereto (other than (A) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such series surrendered in exchange for Registered Securities and maturing after such exchange, surrender of which is not required or has been waived as provided in Section 3.05, (B) Securities of such series and Coupons which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06, (C) Coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities of such series called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date, surrender of which has been waived as provided in Section 10.06 and (D) Securities of such series and
 
Coupons for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(ii) all such Securities and Coupons of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation

Section 5.02 .
Acceleration
If any Event of Default under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vii) with respect to Outstanding Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all of the Securities of that series and accrued interest immediately due and payable. If any Event of Default under clauses (v) or (vi) occurs and is continuing, all principal and interest on the Securities will immediately become due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and to News Corporation and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration (except an acceleration due to a default in payment of the principal or interest on any Security) and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that Series,
 
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Outstanding Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.04.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.03 .
Other Remedies
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the Proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
Section 5.04 .
Waiver of Past Defaults
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of any series of Outstanding Securities, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Holder), may waive an existing Default and its consequences with respect to that series except (a) an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(i) and Section 5.01(ii), or (b) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 8.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured and shall cease to exist, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. This Section 5.04 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)1(B) of the TIA and said Section 316(a)1(8) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or
 
this Indenture or that the Trustee determines in good faith is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. This Section 5.05 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(A) of the TIA and said Section 316(a)(1)(A) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.
Section 5.06 .
Limitation on Suits
A Holder of Securities of any series may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

(b) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense satisfactory to the Trustee;

Section 5.07 .

Section 5.08 .
Collection Suit by Trustee
If an Event of Default described in Section 5.01 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against NAI and the Guarantor for the whole amount owing with respect to the Securities and the amounts provided for in Section 6.06.
Section 5.09 .
Delay or Omission Not Waiver
 
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to NAI, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of NAI, the Guarantor or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal amount, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 5.11 .
Priorities
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 5, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 6.06;
SECOND: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for the principal amount, Redemption Price or interest, if any, as the case may be, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and payable on the Securities; and
THIRD: the balance, if any, to NAI.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 5.11.
Section 5.12 .
Undertaking for Costs
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.

This Section 5.12 shall be in lieu of Section 315(e) of the TIA and said Section 315(e) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.
Section 5.13 .
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
NAI and the Guarantor covenant (to the extent that they may lawfully do so) that they will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that would prohibit or forgive NAI or the Guarantor from paying all or any portion of the principal or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein; and NAI and the Guarantor (to the extent that they may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waive all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenant that they will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 5.14 .
Judgment Currency
The following provisions of this Section 5.14 shall apply to the extent permissible under applicable law: Judgments in respect of any obligations of the Company under any Securities or Coupons, if any, of any series shall be rendered in the currency or currency unit in which such Securities or Coupons are payable. If for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Security or Coupon, it shall become necessary to convert into any other currency or currency unit any amount in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security or Coupon, then such conversion shall be made at the Conversion Rate (as defined below) as in effect on the date the Company shall make payment to any person in satisfaction of such judgment. If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date other than the date payment is made and there shall occur a change between such Conversion Rate and the Conversion Rate as in effect on the date of payment, the Company agrees to pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is the amount in such other currency or currency unit which, when converted at the Conversion Rate as in effect on the date of payment or distribution, is the amount then due hereunder or under such Security or Coupon. Any amount due from the Company under this Section 5.14 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or in respect of any Security or Coupon so that in any event the Company's obligations hereunder or under such Security or Coupon will be effectively maintained as obligations in such currency or currency unit. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security or Coupon at the Conversion Rate as in effect when payment is made than the amount of currency or currency unit stated to be due hereunder or under such Security or Coupon.
 
For purposes of this Section 5.14, "Conversion Rate" shall mean the spot rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the currency or currency unit into which an amount due hereunder or under any Security or Coupon is to be converted could be purchased with the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under any Security or Coupon, at the option of the Company from major banks located in New York, London or any other principal market for such purchased currency or currency unit.

(b) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
Maintenance of Office or Agency
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities (including any Coupons, if any) of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities (including any Coupons, if any) of any series for such purposes. The Company will
 
give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
Section 9.06 . Neither News Corporation nor any Subsidiary will create, assume, incur or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to any of its properties to secure Indebtedness unless contemporaneously therewith or prior thereto the Securities are equally and ratably secured for so long as such other Indebtedness shall be so secured, except this Section 9.06 will not apply to Permitted Encumbrances.
Limitation on Liens
Section 9.07 . To the extent that, after the date of this Indenture, any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor issues any Guarantee of any Public Debt in excess of $100,000,000 and such Subsidiary is not thereafter released from such Guarantee within ten (10) Business Days, such Subsidiary shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which it shall guarantee under this Indenture the Securities to the same extent and in the manner in which such other Public Debt is so guaranteed.
Guarantees by Subsidiaries
Section 9.08 .
Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities; and
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for three years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security and Coupon, if any, shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, or cause to be mailed to such Holder, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

Section 10.02 .
Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities (including Coupons, if any) shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of all or less than all of the Securities (including Coupons, if any) of any series, the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (including Coupons, if any) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities and Coupons, if any, or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
Section 10.03 .
Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed
If less than all the Securities (including Coupons, if any) of any series with the same terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities (including Coupons, if any) to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities (including Coupons, if any) of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities (including Coupons, if any) of that series or any integral multiple
 
thereof) of the principal amount of Securities (including Coupons, if any) of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities (including Coupons, if any) selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 10.04 .
Notice of Redemption
Notice of redemption shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, as provided in Section 1.07.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, the Place or Places of Payment, the CUSIP Number, if any, that the Securities of such series are being redeemed at the option of the Company pursuant to provisions contained in the terms of the Securities of such series or in a supplemental indenture establishing such series, if such be the case, together with a brief statement of the facts permitting such redemption, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the applicable Securities, that all Coupons, if any, maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption shall be void, that any interest accrued to the Redemption Date will be paid as specified in said notice, and that on and after said Redemption Date any interest thereon or, in case of partial redemptions, on the portions thereof to be redeemed, will cease to accrue. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed the notice of redemption shall specify the numbers of the Securities of such series to be redeemed, and, if only Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities, the last date on which exchanges of Bearer Securities for Registered Securities not subject to redemption may be made. In case any Security of any series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security and any Coupons appertaining thereto, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof and with appropriate Coupons will be issued, or, in the case of Registered Securities providing appropriate space for such notation, at the option of the Holders, the Trustee, in lieu of delivering a new Security or Securities as aforesaid, may make a notation on such Security of the payment of the redeemed portion thereof.
Notice of redemption of Securities and Coupons, if any, to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request delivered at least 10 days before the date such notice is to be given (unless a shorter period shall be acceptable to the Trustee), by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
Section 10.05 .
Deposit of Redemption Price
On or before (but in the case of payments to be made at a Place of Payment outside of the United States, its territories, possessions and areas subject to its jurisdiction, at least one New
 
York Business Day before) any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit in immediately available funds with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 9.08) an amount of money in the relevant currency (or a sufficient number of currency units, as the case may be) sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
Section 10.06 .
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph, upon surrender of any such Security (including Coupons, if any) for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07.
If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Bearer Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them, the Guarantor, and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside of the United States except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 9.05.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
Section 10.07 .
Securities Redeemed in Part
Any Security (including Coupons, if any) which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities (with appropriate Coupons, if any, attached) of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security (including Coupons, if any) so surrendered.
 
Section 11.01 .
Applicability of Article

Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 11.03 .
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 11.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 nor more than 60 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 10.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 10.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 10.06 and 10.07.
 
Section 12.01 .
Guarantees
Each of News Corporation and the other Guarantors, if any, for consideration received, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees on a senior basis to each holder of Securities of a series designated pursuant to Section 3.01 as being guaranteed by each Guarantor so specified and to the Trustee, as applicable, (1) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Security (including interest accruing on or after filing of any petition in bankruptcy or reorganization whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed in such proceeding), when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, as a result of redemption, upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, by acceleration or otherwise, (ii) the due and punctual payment of interest on overdue principal of, premium and interest, if any, on the Securities, to the extent lawful, (iii) the due and punctual performance of all other obligations under this Indenture to the Holders or the Trustee, including payment obligations under Section 6.06, all in accordance with the terms of such Security and of this Indenture, and (iv) in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, at redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, to be paid by such Guarantor or through the other Guarantors as provided below. In all respects, each relevant Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any such Security or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any such Security or this Indenture, any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to NAI with respect thereto, by the Holder of such Security or the Trustee, or any other circumstances which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of NAI, any right to require a proceeding first against NAI, the benefit of discussion, protest or notice with respect to any such Security or the Indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged as to any such Security or the Trustee except by payment in full of the principal thereof, premium, if any, and interest thereon and as provided in Section 4.01 and payment in full of the obligations set forth in Section 6.06. If the Trustee or any Holder is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or each Guarantor or any custodian, receiver, liquidator, trustee or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or each Guarantor, any amount paid to the Trustee or such Holder in respect of any Security, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged by the payment of such amount, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between each Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 5 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 5 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of this Guarantee. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be joint and several. For purposes of this Article 12, the liability of News Corporation shall be that amount
 
from time to time equal to the aggregate of its liability hereunder, which shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the obligation as stated in the first sentence of this Section 12.01 with respect to the Securities of any particular series guaranteed pursuant to Section 3.01 and this Article 12 issued pursuant to this Indenture. For purposes of this Article 12, the liability of each Guarantor, other than News Corporation, shall be that amount from time to time equal to the aggregate liability of such Guarantor hereunder, but shall be limited to the least of (A) the aggregate amount of the obligation as stated in the first sentence of this Section 12.01 with respect to the Securities of any particular series guaranteed pursuant to Section 3.01 and this Article 12 issued pursuant to this Indenture or (B) the amount, if any, which would not have (i) rendered such Guarantor "insolvent" (as such term is defined in Section 1.01 (29) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and in Section 271 of the Debtor and Creditor Law of the State of New York, as each is in effect at the date of this Indenture) or (ii) left it with unreasonably small capital at the time its Guarantee of the Securities was entered into, after giving effect to the incurrence of existing Indebtedness immediately prior to such time, provided, that it shall be a presumption in any lawsuit or other proceeding in which a Guarantor (other than News Corporation) is a party that the amount guaranteed is the amount set forth in (A) above unless a creditor, or representative of creditors, of such Guarantor or a trustee in bankruptcy of such Guarantor, as debtor in possession, otherwise proves in such a lawsuit that the aggregate liability of such Guarantor is limited to the amount set forth in (B). (The liability of News Corporation pursuant to the second preceding sentence and the liability of each Guarantor other than News Corporation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence are hereinafter referred to as the "Base Guaranty Liability".) In making any determination as to the solvency or sufficiency of capital of a Guarantor in accordance with the second preceding sentence, the right of such Guarantor to contribution from other Guarantors, to subrogation pursuant to the next paragraph of this Section 12.01 and any other rights such Guarantor may have, contractual or otherwise, shall be taken into account.
Each Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of, any Securities and the Trustee against NAI or any of the other Guarantors pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; provided, however, that until the payment in full of all obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guarantee, the Guarantors hereby irrevocably waive any claim or other rights which they each may now or hereafter acquire against the Company or any of the other Guarantors that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantors' obligations under this Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Holder and the Trustee on behalf of such Holder against the Company or any of the other Guarantors or any collateral which any such Holder or the Trustee on behalf of such Holder hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company or any of the other Guarantors, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantors in violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full of all obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guarantee, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to the Guarantors for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, any Holder and the Trustee on behalf of any such Holder, and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such Holder to be credited and applied upon such guaranteed obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this
 
Indenture. The Guarantors acknowledge that the waiver set forth in this Section 12.01 is knowingly made.
The Guarantee set forth in this Section 12.01 shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose with respect to a Security until the certificate of authentication on such Security shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee.
Section 12.02 . Nothing contained in this Article 12 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any Security is intended to or shall impair, as between the Guarantors, if any, and the Holders and the Trustee, the obligation of each Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders and the Trustee the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities designated pursuant to Section 3.01 as having such Guarantee apply (and to the Trustee amounts due under Section 6.06) as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this Guarantee, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon Default under this Indenture.
Obligations of the Guarantors Unconditional
Section 12.03 . To evidence their guarantee to the Holders of Securities of each relevant series specified in Section 3.01 and 12.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees to execute a notation relating to the Guarantee on each such Security authenticated and made available for delivery by the Trustee. Each Guarantor agrees that execution of this Indenture shall evidence its Guarantee of the expenses of the Trustee specified in Section 12.01 and Section 6.06 and its Guarantee to the Holders specified in Section 12.01. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 12.01 shall remain in full force and effect whether or not any endorsement of the Guarantee is contained on any Security. Each such Guarantee shall be signed on behalf of each Guarantor by its Chairman of the Board, President or a Vice President, or an Officer of News Corporation authorized by power of attorney to act on behalf of such Guarantor prior to the authentication of the Security on which it is endorsed, and being made available for delivery of such Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of such Guarantee on behalf of such Guarantor. Such signatures upon the Guarantee may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present, past or any future such officers and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Guarantee, and in case any such officer who shall have signed the Guarantee shall cease to be such officer before the Security on which such Guarantee is endorsed shall have been authenticated and made available for delivery by the Trustee or disposed of by NAI, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and made available for delivery or disposed of as though the person who signed the Guarantee had not ceased to be such officer of the Guarantor.
Execution of Guarantee
Section 12.04 . Upon (i) the sale or disposition (by merger or otherwise) of a Guarantor (other than News Corporation) to an entity which is not a Subsidiary of News Corporation; or (ii) if a Guarantor is a guarantor under any Public Debt (and has not been released from its obligations as guarantor of all such Public Debt), the payment in full of all Public Debt guaranteed by Guarantor; or (iii) the unconditional and full release of a Guarantor who is a guarantor of Public Debt, from all obligations under guarantees of the Public Debt, that Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under its Guarantee without any further action required on the part
Release of a Guarantor
 
of the Trustee or any Holder of Securities of the relevant series. News Corporation may be released from all obligations under its Guarantee without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of Securities of the relevant series at the option of NAI if (x) News Corporation is not a guarantor under any Public Debt and (y) following the date of the release of News Corporation NAI will comply with Section 314(a) of the TIA. Any Guarantor not so released remains liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Securities and the payment obligations to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.05 of the Indenture as provided in the Guarantee. The Trustee shall make available for delivery an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request of NAI accompanied by an Officer's Certificate certifying as to the compliance with this Indenture.
Section 13.01 .
Repurchase upon Change of Control
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
(a) If there shall have occurred a Change of Control Triggering Event, Securities shall be purchased by NAI, at the option of the Holder thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of $1,000, on a date that is not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days from the date the Change of Control Notice referred to below is given to Holders or such later date as may be necessary for NAI to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act (such date, or such later date, the "Change of Control Purchase Date"), at a purchase price in cash (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Securities, plus accrued interest (including any defaulted interest), if any, to the Change of Control Purchase Date, subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in Section 13.01(c).
(b) Within 60 days after the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, NAI shall give written notice of such Change of Control Triggering Event (a "Change of Control Notice") to the Trustee with respect to its obligation to offer to purchase Securities pursuant hereto (the "Change of Control Offer"), and the Trustee shall promptly upon its receipt of such notice forward a copy of such notice to Holders. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to ascertain the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event or to give notice with respect thereto other than as provided above upon receipt of a Change of Control Notice from NAI. The Change of Control Notice shall state:
(i) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to a covenant in the Indenture and that all Securities validly tendered will be accepted for payment;
(ii) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date;
(iii) that, unless NAI defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price, any Securities accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date and that any Security not purchased will continue to accrue interest;
 
(iv) that Holders electing to have Securities purchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Securities, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Securities completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the Change of Control Payment Date;
(v) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tender of Securities if the Paying Agent receives, not later that the close of business on the Change of Control Payment Date, a telex, telegram, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the certificate number of the Securities delivered for purchase, the principal amount of the Securities delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Securities purchased; and
(vi) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part will be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered.
(c) A Holder may exercise the rights specified in Section 13.01(a) upon (i) delivery to any Paying Agent of Securities with the "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse thereof properly completed at any time prior to the close of business on the Change of Control Purchase Date. If a Holder has elected to deliver to NAI for purchase a portion of a Security, and if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, NAI shall purchase such portion from the Holder thereof pursuant to this Section 13.01. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Security also apply to the purchase of a portion of such Security.
(d) On or prior to 12:00 noon New York City time on the Change of Control Purchase Date, NAI shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if NAI is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) an amount of money in same day funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price of, and (except if the Change of Control Purchase Date shall be an Interest Payment Date as set forth in the form of Security) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be purchased on that date.
(e) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of properly tendered Securities, the Holder of the Security in respect of which such proper tender was made shall (unless the tender of such Security is properly withdrawn) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Change of Control Purchase Price with respect to such Security. Upon surrender of any such Security for purchase in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such Security shall be paid by NAI at the Change of Control Purchase Price on the Change of Control Purchase Date; provided, however, that installments of interest which are due on or prior to the Change of Control Purchase Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more predecessor Securities, registered as such on the relevant regular Record Dates set forth in the form of Security. If any Security tendered for purchase shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof, the principal thereof (and premium, if any, thereon) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Change of Control Purchase Date at the rate borne by such Security.
