News Corporation Announces Stock Repurchase Program of $5 Billion
__________________________________________
- News Corporation today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program totaling $5 billion.
NEW YORK, NY, July 12, 2011
This program increases the approximately $1.8 billion remaining under the Company's current program to $5 billion. News Corporation is targeting to acquire the $5 billion of Class A common stock and Class B common stock from time to time over the next 12 months. Repurchases under the program will be made through open market transactions. The timing of such transactions and class of shares purchased depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and blackout periods. The Company is currently in a blackout period and does not intend to commence the repurchase program until that period expires on August 15, 2011. The share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of its common stock, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. (NASDAQ: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) had total assets as of March 31, 2011 of approximately US$60 billion and total annual revenues of approximately US$33 billion. News Corporation is a diversified global media company with operations in six industry segments: cable network programming; filmed entertainment; television; direct broadcast satellite television; publishing; and other. The activities of News Corporation are conducted principally in the United States, Continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Asia and Latin America.
