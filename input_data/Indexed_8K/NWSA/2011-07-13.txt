Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer, News Corporation, commented: "We believed that the proposed acquisition of BSkyB by News Corporation would benefit both companies but it has become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate. News Corporation remains a committed long-term shareholder in BSkyB. We are proud of the success it has achieved and our contribution to it."

(ii) BSkyB announces a whitewash proposal for Rule 9 purposes or a reverse takeover not involving News Corp or any subsidiary of News Corp.
In the event that News Corp is permitted pursuant to the City Code to announce an offer or possible offer for BSkyB, News Corp reserves the right to do so at any price and at a price less than 700 pence per BSkyB Share in the event that either: (i) it is recommended by the Board of BSkyB; or (ii) there is an announcement by a third party of an offer or a possible offer for BSkyB at a price lower than 700 pence per BSkyB Share; or (iii) BSkyB declares, makes or pays a dividend which is in excess of its stated dividend policy at the time of this announcement; or (iv) it is so permitted by the City Code.
Any such offer or possible offer by News Corp or any subsidiary of News Corp will be subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval.
