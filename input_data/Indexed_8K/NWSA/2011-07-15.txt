He has proven himself to be a very effective operator in his time at Sky Italia. Under his leadership, Sky has grown to become one of the world's most successful pay TV businesses, reaching close to 5 million homes and launching channels like TG24 which has set a new standard for independent journalism in Italy.

Les Hinton, Chief Executive Officer of Dow Jones & Company and Publisher of The Wall Street Journal Resigns from Company
__________________________________________
- News Corporation today announced the resignation of Les Hinton, Chief Executive Officer of Dow Jones & Company and Publisher of The Wall Street Journal, effective immediately. Mr. Hinton, a 52-year veteran of News Corporation, has led Dow Jones since December, 2007.
New York, NY, July 15, 2011
"Les and I have been on a remarkable journey together for more than 52 years. That this passage has come to an unexpected end, professionally, not personally, is a matter of much sadness to me," commented Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO of News Corporation. "On this difficult day we should appreciate that his extraordinary work has provided a platform for the future success of Dow Jones. And his great contribution to News Corporation over more than five decades has enhanced innumerable lives, whether those of employees hired by him or of readers better informed because of him. News Corporation is not Rupert Murdoch. It is the collective creativity and effort of many thousands of people around the world, and few individuals have given more to this Company than Les Hinton."
Mr. Hinton commented, "I have watched with sorrow from New York as the News of the World story has unfolded. I have seen hundreds of news reports of both actual and alleged misconduct during the time I was executive chairman of News International and responsible for the company. The pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable. That I was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances I feel it is proper for me to resign from News Corp. and apologize to those hurt by the actions of News of the World."
"When I left News International in December 2007, I believed that the rotten element at the News of the World had been eliminated; that important lessons had been learned; and that journalistic integrity was restored," he continued. "My testimonies before the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee were given honestly. When I appeared before the Committee in March 2007, I expressed the belief that Clive Goodman had acted alone, but made clear our investigation was continuing. In September 2009, I told the Committee there had never been any evidence delivered to me that suggested the conduct had spread beyond one journalist. If others had evidence that wrongdoing went further, I was not told about it."
"Finally, I want to express my gratitude to Rupert for a wonderful working life. My admiration and respect for him are unbounded. He has built a magnificent business since I first joined 52 years ago and it has been an honor making my contribution."
During Mr. Hinton's tenure at Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal has become the number one newspaper in the U.S. He has directed initiatives that have expanded the Journal's scope of coverage, including Greater New York and lifestyle offerings such as WSJ Weekend and WSJ. magazine. On the digital side, WSJ.com has 9.99 million unique visitors in December, 2007. Last month the site had 32.75 million, while the Journal's iPad app has become the standard for the industry. He also managed the extension of business-to-business products from Dow Jones Newswires and Factiva.
Previously, Mr. Hinton served for 12 years as Executive Chairman of News International, News Corporation's U.K. newspaper unit. Earlier, he spent 20 years working in the U.S., first as a correspondent for the Company's newspapers in the U.K. and Australia and later in a series of senior management positions at News Corp.'s publishing and television business units. He was also President and Chief Executive of News America Publishing, responsible for the Company's U.S. publishing operations, and Chairman and Chief Executive of Fox Televisions. Mr. Hinton became a U.S. citizen in 1985.
Following Mr. Hinton's departure, Dow Jones President Todd Larsen will report to News Corporation Deputy Chairman, President and COO Chase Carey.

Exhibit 99.3
I am writing to update you on the actions we have been taking as a Company to solve the problems at News International relating to the News of the World, in addition to continuing to cooperate fully and actively with the police and settling civil claims.
Earlier today, Rebekah Brooks resigned from her position as CEO. I understand her decision and I want to thank her for her 22 years of service to the Company. She has been one of the outstanding editors of her generation and she can be proud of many accomplishments as an executive. We support her as she takes this step to clear her name;
We have created an independent Management & Standards Committee and I want to emphasise its importance. The Committee has direct governance and oversight from News Corporation Board members and is codifying standards that will be clear and enforced;
We made the difficult and necessary decision to close the News of the World;
A number of other executives have now left the Company;
News Corporation also withdrew its proposal to acquire the shares in BSkyB it does not own. This is a strong signal that our top priority in the UK is to address the issues facing News International.
Looking to the future, I am also pleased to tell you that Tom Mockridge will become CEO of News International. Tom is in London today and will start right away. Tom is a highly respected and accomplished media executive who has served as CEO of Sky Italia since its launch in 2003. Tom, who has also been in charge of our European Television business, started his career as a newspaper journalist in New Zealand and he has held a range of top roles in the newspaper industry. The creation of TG-24, Italy's only truly independent 24 hours news channel, is a credit to Tom's leadership and integrity. This weekend, News International will run advertisements in all national newspapers. We will apologise to the nation for what has happened. We will follow this up in the future with communications about the actions we have taken to address the wrongdoing that occurred. We are also sending letters to our commercial partners with an update on the actions we are taking. Next week, my father and I will appear before the CMS Select Committee and will speak to them directly about our determination to put things right. The Company has made mistakes. It is not only receiving appropriate scrutiny, but is also responding to unfair attacks by setting the record straight. I would like to conclude by saying thank you. Throughout this time, you have gotten out great papers every day and have stayed focused. I am deeply grateful for that. James Murdoch.
