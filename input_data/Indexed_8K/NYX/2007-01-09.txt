If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied to the Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).
     
(c)     
Maintenance of Records by Lenders
. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
     
(d)     
Maintenance of Records by Administrative Agent

(e)     
Effect of Entries
. The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
     
(f)     
Promissory Notes
. Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). Any Lender that ceases to be a Lender hereunder shall a s promptly as practicable return its notes (if any) to the Borrower after termination of its Commitment and payment to it of all principal and interest owing to it hereunder.

(b)     
Mandatory Prepayments Due to Currency Fluctuations
. On the first Business Day of each calendar month (or at such other times as the Required Lenders may request (but not more frequently than once in any rolling three month period)), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of all of the Lenders (including the Euro Equivalent of any portion thereof that is denominated in Dollars). For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan that is denominated in Dollars shall be deemed to be the Euro Equivalent of the amount in Dollars of such Loan, as of the relevant determination date. Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Le nders and the Borrower thereof. If on the date of such determination the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures of all of the Lenders exceed the
aggregate Commitments as then in effect, then, if requested by the Required Lenders (through the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall prepay Loans in such amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of all of the Lenders do not exceed the aggregate Commitments.
     
(c)      
Notices, Etc.
The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder not later than 1:00 p.m., London time (or in the case of a prepayment of a prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing in Dollars, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York time), three Business Days before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided
that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitm ents as contemplated by Section 2.06, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.06. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.10 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.07(b) .

provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly Date and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;

Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of facility fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
     SECTION 2.10.
Interest
.
     
(a)      
Eurocurrency Loans

(b)     
Default Interest
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal on any Loan, 2%
plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus
the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of nonpayment, constituted a Loan in the Currency of the overdue amount with an Interest Period reasonably selected by the Administrative Agent.
     
(c)      
Payment of Interest
. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments;
provided

The applicable EURIBO Rate, LIBO Rate or the Euro Reference Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
     
SECTION 2.11.
Alternate Rate of Interest
. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing (the Currency of such Borrowing herein called the "
Affected Currency
"):
   
(a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the EURIBO Rate or LIBO Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period; or 
   
(b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the EURIBO Rate or LIBO Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or
maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, the rate of interest on each Lender's share of the affected Loan for the Interest Period applicable thereto shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of the rate notified to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of such Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to such Lender of funding its participation in such Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select,
plus
the Applicable Margin and, if any (and without duplication), the MCR Cost applicable to such Lender's participation in such Loan. So long as such circumstances shall exist and if the Administrative Agent or the Borrower so requires, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than thirty days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest (which shall be subject to the prior consent of all the Lenders).
     SECTION 2.12.
Increased Costs
.
     (a)     
Increased Costs Generally
. If any Change in Law shall:
   
(i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or 
   
(ii)      impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, in Euros, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. This Section shall not apply with respect to Taxes.
     
(b)     
Capital Requirements
. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
     
(c)     
Certificates from Lenders
. A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive,
provided
that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount due within 10 days after receipt thereof.
     
(d)     
Delay in Requests
. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;
provided

provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 45-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
     
SECTION 2.13.
Break Funding Payments
. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the failure to borrow, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.08(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith or (c) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16(b) of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eu rocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan denominated in the Currency of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the applicable EURIBO Rate or LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or continue for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan),
over
(ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits of a comparable amount and period denominated in such Currency from ot her banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive,
provided
that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount due within 10 days after receipt thereof.

provided
that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all such required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
     
(b)     
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower

provided
,
however
, that the Administrative Agent or the relevant Lender shall not be required to participate in any contest that would, in its reasonable judgment, expose it to a material commercial disadvantage or require it to disclose any information it considers confidential or proprietary. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender (together with any supporting detail reasonably requested by the Borrower), shall be conclusive,
provided
that such amounts are determined on a reasonable basis.
     
(d)     
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as reasonably practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     
(e)     
Non-U.S. Lenders
. Any Non-U.S. Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, or as reasonably requested by the Borrower such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (or, in the case of a participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased), on or before the date that such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, two properly completed and duly executed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, as applicable, (or successor forms thereto), claiming a complete exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly provide such forms upon becoming aware of the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender (unless it is legally unable to do so as a result of a Change in Law) and shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that any previously delivered forms are no longer valid.
     
(f)     
Refunds
. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes from the Governmental Authority to which such Taxes or Other Taxes were paid as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governme ntal Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any interest to the extent accrued from the date such refund is paid over to the Borrower) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
     SECTION 2.15.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set offs
.
     
(a)     
Payments by Borrower
. The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, except payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. Th e Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement (including facility fees, payments required under Section 2.12, and payments required under Section 2.13 relating to any Loan denominated in Euros, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in Dollars or payments relating to
any such Loan required under Section 2.13, which are payable in Dollars) are payable in Euros. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if such Loan is not denominated in Euros, automatically be redenominated in Euros on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Euro Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Euros, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Euros on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period theref or, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Euro Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.
     
(b)     
Application of Insufficient Payments
. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
     
(c)     
Pro Rata Treatment
. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of facility fee under Section 2.09 shall be made for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.06 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by t he Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders.
     
(d)      
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to
apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
     
(e)     
Presumptions of Payment
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is di stributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, calculated at a rate of interest by the Administrative Agent to reflect its cost of funds.
     
(f)     
Certain Deductions by Administrative Agent
. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.15(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
     
(a)

. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 or incurs any MCR Cost pursuant to Exhibit A, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, or such MCR Costs in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
     
(b)     
Replacement of Lenders
. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 or incurs any MCR Cost pursuant to Exhibit A, or if the Borrower is required to pay
any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), which shall upon such assumption be a "Lender" for all purposes hereof;
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent to such assignee (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12, payments of any MCR Cost pursuant to Exhibit A or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
     
The Borrower and NYSE Group (in each case as to itself and, to the extent expressly set forth below, its Subsidiaries or Significant Subsidiaries, as applicable) represents and warrants to the Lenders that as of the Effective Date:
