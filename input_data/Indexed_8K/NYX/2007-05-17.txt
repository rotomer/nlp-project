Record quarter for Euronext' revenues: 310.1m, up 15.6% YOY
Amsterdam, 15 May 2007.
The first quarter of 2007 has been the best one ever with strong level of activity both on cash and on derivatives markets. These positive market conditions have allowed all business lines to register an increase in their revenues. As a result, revenues for the first quarter of 2007 reached a record level of 310.1m, a progress of 15.6% compared to the 268.1m achieved in Q1, 2006.
Listing fees:
Primary activity has been strong over the first quarter, with 25 new listings compared to 20 during the same quarter in 2006. The success of Alternext is confirmed with 86 companies listed including 11 new listings over the quarter. As a result, quarterly revenues amounted to 12.2m, representing an increase of 37.9% compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Cash trading:
The first quarter of 2007 has been the best one ever on Euronext cash markets, with nearly 74 million cash transactions completed. Compared with the 57.7 million transactions recorded during the same quarter in 2006, this represents an increase of 28.1%.
Thanks to this high level of activity, revenues from cash trading amounted to 89.9m in Q1, 2007 (+23.1% compared to the 73.1m booked in the same quarter last year).
Derivatives trading:
Euronext.liffe traded a record quarter across all the product lines of derivatives products: equity products including B-Clear products (+18% YOY), interest rates products (+23% YOY) and commodity products (+17% YOY).
B-Clear, the Exchange's wholesale administration and clearing service, confirms its strong success: more than 21 million contracts have been dealt over the first 3 months of the year.
Revenues from derivatives trading stood at 115.3m, +17.9% compared to the level of Q1, 2006 (97.8m).
MTS fixed-income
: Revenues realised in Q1, 2007 were 6.1m, an increase of 2.5% compared to Q1, 2006, benefiting from record volumes for the Repo and BondVision markets.
Settlement and custody:
This activity has been healthy this quarter, registering a progress in its revenues of 11.4%, to 3.9m, thanks to the rise of share market prices and combined with an increase in volumes.
Information services:
This activity benefited from the growth in the number of terminals, and from the contribution of Hugin from the 1
st
of January 2007 (2.9m) and CompanyNews from March 2006 (1m in Q1, 2007).
As a result, quarterly revenues progressed by more than 25%, passing from 26.2m in Q1, 2006 to 32.8m this quarter.
Sales of software:
GL Trade realised stable revenues compared to last year, amounting to 44.7m as a combination of the sale of Fermat on 1 January 2007 and the integration of OBMS (acquired in September 2006) and Emos (acquired in July 2006).
Other Revenues:
These revenues amounted to 5.0m this quarter. The decrease of 3.1m compared to Q1, 2006 was due to termination of the service agreement on space rental with AEMS in London.

NYSE Euronext, which brings together six cash equities exchanges in five countries and six derivatives exchanges in six countries, is a world leader for listings, trading in cash equities, equity and interest rate derivatives, bonds and the distribution of market data.

About Euronext N.V.
Euronext N.V., a subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, has successfully integrated local markets across Europe to provide users with a unified market that is broad, liquid and cost effective. Euronext is the largest central order book cash market in Europe and the second largest derivatives exchange in the world, by value of business traded.
Following the initial three-way merger of the local exchanges of Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, Euronext acquired the London-based derivatives market LIFFE and merged with the Portuguese exchange in 2002. Euronext's unique business model incorporates the individual strengths and assets of each local market and has been implemented on all of Euronext's markets, covers technological integration, the harmonisation of market rules and the regulatory framework. The implementation of Euronext's horizontal model designed to generate synergies has proved that the most successful way to merge European exchanges is to apply global vision at a local level. Euronext's IT integration was completed in 2004, when a four-year migration plan resulted in harmonised IT platforms for cash trading (NSC) and derivatives (LIFFE CONNECT). As a result, every market participant now has a single point of access to trading. Euronext's IT structure was rationalized in 2005 with the creation of Atos Euronext Market Solutions (AEMS), an IT services-related vehicle between Euronext and Atos Origin which is now a leading global provider of technology services to Euronext and other global capital markets.
