Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On June 7, 2007, NYSE Euronext amended the terms of the awards granted in 2005 under the Euronext N.V. Executive Incentive Plan, as permitted by that plan, to take into account the April 4, 2007 combination of NYSE Group, Inc. and Euronext N.V. As a result of these changes, which were approved by Euronext N.V.'s shareholders on May 22, 2007, each participant will be entitled to elect either to (1) receive the participant's share award on an accelerated basis, at 100 percent of the target level, such shares to be restricted until December 31, 2007 or (2) retain the target share award through the end of the original 2005 to 2007 performance period, subject to achievement of an amended 2007 performance goal based on Euronext 2007 budgeted revenues, thus allowing the participant the opportunity to achieve an actual award of up to 120 percent of the target level as contemplated by the plan.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
