On April 19, 2007, NYSE Euronext and SG Securities (Paris) SAS ("SG") entered into a liquidity agreement (the "Agreement"), the terms of which have been more fully described in NYSE Euronext's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2007.
The Agreement authorizes SG to carry out market purchases and sales of NYSE Euronext common stock on Euronext Paris (the "Market") in France for the account of NYSE Euronext in order to promote the liquidity and the orderly listing of such securities on the Market. All transactions under the Agreement will be executed offshore (outside the United States) and, except for block transactions, only through the Market's electronic trading system. SG may also undertake block transactions under the Agreement, provided such transactions are made in accordance with the rules governing the Market.
In performing its obligations under the Agreement, SG has agreed to comply with the guidelines and regulations of the AMF, the anti-manipulation and related provisions applicable in France, and the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sales under the Agreement have been made in offshore transactions exempt from registration.
Sales and purchases of NYSE Euronext common stock may be suspended if NYSE Euronext becomes subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions that would prevent SG from making purchases and sales under the Agreement.
The following sales were carried out by SG on the market under the Agreement during the period from April 4 through August 8, 2007:
