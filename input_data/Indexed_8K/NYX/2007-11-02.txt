NYSE Euronext does not intend for this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 to be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or to be incorporated by reference into filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK  Nov. 2, 2007  NYSE Euronext (NYSE Euronext: NYX) today reported net income of $258 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2007, a 279% increase as compared to net income of $68 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2006. These results are presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Third quarter 2007 GAAP results include the operations of NYSE Group and Euronext N.V. for the full quarter. The comparative results for 2006 reflect the operations of NYSE Group only.
"During the third quarter, we delivered record financial results through strong growth across our business lines, driven largely by record trading volumes in the U.S. and Europe and ongoing expense control," said Nelson Chai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "These results reflect the tremendous benefits we derive from operating a globally diversified company, with a business model that will continue to serve us well as we make further progress towards realizing the synergies related to the NYSE Euronext merger."
Included in the results for the three months ended September 30, 2007 are (i) $22 million in merger expenses incurred in connection with both the acquisition of Archipelago Holdings on March 7, 2006 and the combination with Euronext N.V. on April 4, 2007, and exit costs, (ii) a $32 million gain on the sale of the member firm regulatory functions of NYSE Regulation to FINRA, and (iii) a $55 million deferred tax benefit related to an enacted reduction of the UK corporate tax rate from 30% to 28%.
Giving effect to the Archipelago and Euronext transactions as if they had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, but excluding merger expenses, exit costs and other non-recurring items, NYSE Euronext's net income on a non-GAAP basis for the three months ended September 30, 2007 would have been $202 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, a $85 million or 73% increase as compared to net income of $117 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2006. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew 68% to $320 million for the third quarter of 2007 from $190 million in the year-ago period. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP results is included in the attached tables.
At constant USD/Euro exchange rates, neutralizing the impact of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and equity investments for the period, and on a non-GAAP basis, NYSE Euronext's revenues, net of activity assessment fees, for the three months ended September 30, 2007 increased 34%, while fixed operating expenses (defined as operating expenses, net of Section 31 fees, merger expenses, exit costs, liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees) decreased 8% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2006.

The results of operations of Euronext N.V. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 are reported under U.S. GAAP under the caption "European Operations" in the accompanying tables. Questions regarding Euronext N.V.'s third quarter results should be directed to Investor Relations (contact details provided above).
To supplement NYSE Euronext's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and to better reflect period-over-period comparisons, NYSE Euronext uses non-GAAP financial measures of performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not replace and are not superior to the presentation of GAAP financial results, but are provided to (i) present the effects of certain merger expenses and exit costs, and other non-recurring items, and (ii) to improve overall understanding of NYSE Euronext's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, NYSE Euronext believes the non-GAAP financial results provide useful information to both management and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to financial condition and operating results. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing financial results and evaluating financial performance. The non-GAAP adjustments for all periods presented are based upon information and assumptions available as of the date of this release.
