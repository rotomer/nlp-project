Exhibit 99.1
 
NEW YORK  May 6, 2008  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $230 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2008, a $162 million or 238% increase as compared to net income of $68 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2007. These results are presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The comparative results for 2007 reflect the operations of NYSE Group only.
"Our strong performance in the first quarter of 2008 highlights the growing demand for our broad array of products and services across all of our business units and the inherent operating leverage in NYSE Euronext's diverse business model," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We are very pleased with the growth in our transaction-related revenues, which underscores our leadership position in an increasingly competitive environment. We remain focused on executing our global growth strategy, operating with the utmost efficiency, strengthening our competitive position, and providing exceptional customer and shareholder value."
Joost van der Does de Willebois, Acting CFO, NYSE Euronext, added, "In addition to producing strong revenue growth, we are well on target to achieve our annual $250 million in technology-run rate savings. In the first quarter, we achieved $70 million in annual IT run-rate savings, which exceeds our previously announced $50 million goal."
On a non-GAAP basis, giving effect to the Euronext transaction as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and excluding merger expenses and exit costs, the net income of NYSE Euronext for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2008 would have been $241 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, an $83 million or 53% increase versus non-GAAP net income of $158 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2007. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP results is included in the attached tables.
At constant US$/ and US$/ exchange rates, neutralizing the impact of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and equity investments for the period, and on a non-GAAP basis, NYSE Euronext's revenues, net of activity assessment fees, for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2008 increased $236 million, or 25%, while operating income increased $99 million, or 38%, compared to the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2007. In addition, on a normalized basis, revenues increased $129 million, or 12%, while operating income increased $93 million, or 34%, compared to the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2007. Please refer to the table entitled "Normalized operating income including non-GAAP financial measures."
During the first quarter of 2008, NYSE Euronext announced plans to acquire the American Stock Exchange, introduced NYSE Euronext Advanced Trading Solutions in connection with our acquisition of Wombat Financial Software, agreed to purchase a 5% stake in India's Multi Commodity Exchange, and entered the U.S. futures market through our acquisition of the CME Group precious metals complex.

To supplement NYSE Euronext's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and to better reflect period-over-period comparisons, NYSE Euronext uses non-GAAP financial measures of performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not replace and are not superior to the presentation of GAAP financial results, but are provided to (i) present the effects of certain merger expenses and exit costs, and other non-recurring items, and (ii) to improve overall understanding of NYSE Euronext's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, NYSE Euronext believes the non-GAAP financial results provide useful information to both management and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to financial condition and operating results. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing financial results and evaluating financial performance. The non-GAAP adjustments for all periods presented are based upon information and assumptions available as of the date of this release.
