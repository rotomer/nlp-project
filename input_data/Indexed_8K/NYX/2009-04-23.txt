The Agency Agreement provides for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant. Under the negative pledge covenant, the Company has agreed that its present or future indebtedness shall not be secured by any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge or other security interests unless the equivalent is provided with respect to the New Notes, or otherwise approved by the holders. The Agency Agreement does not contain any financial covenants.
The New Notes will mature on June 30, 2015. Interest on the New Notes will be payable annually on June 30 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2009.
The New Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank with all other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.

In consideration of the agreement by the Joint Lead Managers to act as the managers in relation to the issue of the Notes and to subscribe and pay for or procure subscriptions and payment for the Notes as provided above, the Issuer shall pay to the Joint Lead Managers a combined selling concession and management and underwriting commission of 0.30 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes. The Joint Lead Managers shall be entitled to deduct such commission from the Subscription Price as provided in clauses 1 and 2. Arrangements for the apportionment of such commission have been separately agreed between the Joint Lead Managers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Issuer shall pay to that Joint Lead Manager on demand an amount equal to such Loss. No Joint Lead Manager shall have any duty or obligation, whether as fiduciary or trustee for any Relevant Party or otherwise, to recover any such payment or to account to any other person for any amounts paid to it under this subclause 6.2.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a Joint Lead Manager (or persons acting on its behalf), in connection with the distribution of the Notes, offers Notes in excess of the aggregate principal amount to be issued or effects transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at levels other than those which might otherwise prevail in the open market, such person(s) shall not in doing so be deemed to act as an agent of the Issuer.

The Fiscal Agent may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to any modification of any of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Agency Agreement either (i) for the purpose of curing any ambiguity or of curing, correcting or supplementing any manifest or proven error or any other defective provision contained herein or therein or (ii) in any other manner which is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders. Any modification shall be binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, unless the Fiscal Agent agrees otherwise, any modification shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 11.
 
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders create and issue further notes, having terms and conditions the same as those of the Notes, or the same except for the amount of the first payment of interest, which may be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding Notes.
 
 
The Agency Agreement, the Notes and the Coupons are governed by, and will be construed in accordance with English law.
 
The Issuer has irrevocably agreed for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Couponholders that the courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Notes or the Coupons and accordingly has submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. The Issuer waives any objection to the courts of England on the grounds that they are an inconvenient or inappropriate forum.
The Noteholders and the Couponholders may take any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the Notes or the Coupons respectively (together referred to as ) against the Issuer in any other court of competent jurisdiction and concurrent Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.
Proceedings
 
The Issuer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally appoints Clifford Chance Secretaries Limited at its registered office for the time being as its agent for service of process in England in respect of any Proceedings and undertakes that in the event of such agent ceasing so to act it will appoint another person as its agent for that purpose.
 
The Issuer has in the Agency Agreement submitted to the jurisdiction of the English courts and appointed an agent in England for service of process, in terms substantially similar to those set out above.

"With our 250 million note maturing in June 2009 and the credit markets relatively stable, we felt it was a good time to tap the markets and term-out a portion of our commercial paper outstanding at a fixed rate, by increasing our EUR750 million notes due in June of 2015," said Michael S.
