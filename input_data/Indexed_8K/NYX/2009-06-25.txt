On June 19, 2009, NYSE Euronext, a Delaware corporation ("NYX"), entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Shareholders' Agreement dated June 24, 2008 (the "Shareholders' Agreement") with Qatar Holding ("QH"), the strategic and direct investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority, a Qatar governmental entity ("QIA"). The amended Shareholders' Agreement represents a strategic partnership between NYX and the State of Qatar to establish the Qatar Exchange (the successor to the Doha Securities Market ("DSM")).
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholders Agreement and the Amendment, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1. The Shareholders' Agreement was attached as exhibit 10.5 to NYX's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2008 which was filed on August 13, 2008.
 
The Qatar Exchange, as the successor to the DSM, will continue to provide a market for cash equities, and the aim of management is also to create a new derivatives market. NYX has agreed to contribute US$200 million in cash to acquire a 20% ownership interest in the Qatar Exchange. As previously announced by NYX, US$40 million of the US$200 million investment was paid upon closing on June 19, 2009 and generally, the remaining US$160 million is to be paid in four equal installments on each of the next four anniversaries of the closing date. QIA will retain the remaining 80% ownership of the Qatar Exchange through QH, and the current DSM, including approximately US$200 million in cash, will be transferred to the new Qatar Exchange.
In addition, the Qatar Exchange will adopt the latest NYX trading and network technologies and NYX will provide certain management services to the Qatar Exchange at negotiated rates.
Further, on June 19, 2009, NYX and QH issued a joint press release announcing the signing of formal terms of the strategic partnership and jointly participated in a press briefing. A copy of the press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Doha / New York / Paris, 19 June 2009  Qatar Holding ("QH"), the strategic and direct investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority ("QIA"), and NYSE Euronext (NYX) today announced the signing of binding agreements to form a major strategic partnership which will establish Qatar Exchange (successor to the current Doha Securities Market ("DSM")) as a world-class international exchange, and provide NYSE Euronext with a valuable presence in the Middle East. The successful closing of negotiations follows a preliminary announcement on 24 June 2008 that Qatar had selected NYSE Euronext as a partner.
Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
Under the terms of today's agreements:
 
 
 
 
 
Commenting on today's announcement, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, said:
"Today's announcement paves the way for Qatar to take a prominent role in the world's capital markets for the benefit of both the people of Qatar and the Middle East more generally. Our vision is to create a world class financial center around a global exchange that is on par with the deepest pools of capital across Europe, the U.S. and Asia.
"These international markets may be facing uncertain times today, but our focus remains on what the opportunities may be tomorrow for our people and indeed the generations to come. I am delighted, therefore, that we have entered this partnership with NYSE Euronext to help drive forward this ambitious project. This agreement will play an important role in securing the future of the State of Qatar."
Ahmad Al-Sayed, Managing Director and CEO of Qatar Holding, said:
"QH is continuously growing its portfolio of strategic and direct investments for the benefit of the State of Qatar. This latest strategic venture will allow Qatar's financial markets to run on state-of-the-art technology systems. Technology and market know-how transfer opportunities will greatly enhance our knowledge and help generate more high value employment opportunities for our people. When our stock exchange starts trading on Sunday as the Qatar Exchange, it will truly be the start of a new era."
Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer of NYSE Euronext, said:
"Our strategic partnership with the State of Qatar will benefit the Gulf region and customers on a global scale. Our world-class technology, leadership and expertise in the marketplace will complement the strong foundation and vision of our partners. On behalf of my colleagues, I extend special thanks to His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al-Thani, and the Government of Qatar, Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar Holding, Qatar Financial Markets Authority and the entire leadership team of the Doha Securities Market for moving forward on this exciting initiative."
The Strategic Partnership
Today's announcement confirms the strategy behind the partnership between the State of Qatar and NYSE Euronext as set out in the preliminary announcement issued by both parties on 24 June 2008.
The intention of the strategic partnership is to transform the QE into an internationally recognized exchange. It will provide Qatar with total market infrastructure capability and the opportunity to reinforce the country's position as a regional capital market with the introduction to Doha of new trading products, technology and international investors and issuers.
The benefits of the partnership will extend beyond the international development of the QE, as NYSE Euronext has committed to use Doha as its Middle East operational and support hub. Furthermore, both the State of Qatar and NYSE Euronext have committed to work together in partnership to develop other opportunities in the Middle East region.
The terms of the agreements are intended to align closely the interests of both partners to the success of the project. It provides the State of Qatar with a means of developing a sophisticated global market to provide issuers and investors an exposure to the success of its economy which continues to grow despite the global downturn. By 2015, Qatar is expected to be the second-largest economy in the GCC region which underlines the rationale behind the country's role as a major regional capital market. It offers NYSE Euronext the exposure to one of the world's fastest growing regions.
Management
Having now successfully closed the negotiations between both parties with the signing of the agreements, the partners are in a position to take forward the objective of developing Qatar's financial markets to best practice international standards.
The Board of QE will be chaired by His Excellency Dr Khalid Al-Attiyah, State Minister for International Cooperation and the Acting Minister for Business and Trade. Mr. Ahmad Al-Sayed, Managing Director and CEO of Qatar Holding, will be Vice Chairman.
QE's Chief Executive Officer will be Andre Went, who previously served as a Managing Director based at NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam. Other roles in which he served during more than 20 years in the Euronext group include Director Strategy and Market Development Director Group Policy, Euronext Paris, and head of Secondary Markets in Amsterdam.
"I am honored by the confidence the State of Qatar has shown by giving me the opportunity to lead its national stock exchange with the goal of becoming an even more successful, international marketplace," Mr. Went said. "I very much look forward to working with the Board and the QE management and staff and to begin making these great ambitions a reality."
The new market will begin trading as QE under the new management structure on 21 June, 2009. All staff employed by the DSM will be transferred to QE and will continue to enjoy the same employment rights and status.
The aim of the management is to build on the achievements of the DSM, creating a world class exchange trading cash equities and derivatives. Trading will continue to be in Qatari Riyals with longer term plans for multi-currency functions.
Technology
The objective of the management is to run the market using NYSE Euronext technology and transform the market structure within two years.
This will involve QE utilizing NYSE Euronext's SFTI network. SFTI provides a fast and secure communication network infrastructure.
Within the next 12 to 18 months, QE will transition to NYSE Euronext's Universal Trading Platform. The QE platform will connect with SFTI.
Regulation
QE will liaise closely with the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and all other relevant authorities over plans to move towards world class disclosure, transparency and investor protection standards in the Qatari markets.

About Qatar:
The State of Qatar is an emirate occupying the Qatar Peninsula, located on the west coast of the Arabian Gulf.
Qatar is a constitutional monarchy, ruled by the Al-Thani family and a member of both the United Nations and the League of Arab States. The country's government uses the money it obtains from selling this resource to develop Qatar's infrastructure, including education and health facilities.
However, the government is keen to diversify away from depending on natural resources, and has established a number of organisations to ensure the security of future generations by diversifying income streams, as well as seeking to stimulate the private sector. Economic growth has been further strengthened by the benign economic conditions, including respect for the rule of law, stability, and the encouragement of private enterprise. The State now has 1.5 million inhabitants (2008 population census estimate), with 83% of inhabitants residing in the capital city, Doha, and its main suburb, Al-Rayyan.
