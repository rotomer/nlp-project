Financial and Operating Highlights (Non-GAAP)
NEW YORK  February 9, 2010  NYSE Euronext (NYX) a leading global operator of financial markets and provider of innovative trading technologies, today reported net income of $172 million, or $0.66 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss of ($1,338) million, or ($5.06) per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 GAAP results include the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and the requisite reversal of discrete tax reserves. Fourth quarter 2008 results include the impact of merger expenses and exit costs and a non-cash charge for the impairment of certain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding these items was $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $0.52 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
"Our fourth quarter and full-year results were solid, reflecting growing revenue and earnings power driven by our new businesses and our continuing efforts to harmonize our technology infrastructure and trading platforms," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "With the addition of NYFIX Marketplace, we expanded our customer base and points of connectivity with our trading communities. We moved forward with the semi-mutualization of our U.S. futures platform, and we plan to do the same with the NYSE Amex options business. We continue to make progress with the migration to the Universal Trading Platform that will provide global scale and will be a competitive differentiator and with our data center build-out nearly complete, we will expand the suite of technology services we offer our clients today, while enhancing our ability to develop the cutting-edge products of the future."
 
The table below summarizes our non-GAAP results:
 
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, NYSE Euronext, commented, "Our fourth quarter results represented the third consecutive quarterly increase in net revenue and earnings per share, reflecting increasing momentum in our business model and the continuing benefit of our various cost reduction programs. For the full-year 2009, we recorded fixed operating expenses of $1,683 million, well below the $1,742 million for full-year 2008, despite the addition of several new businesses including the former Amex businesses, NYSE Liffe Clearing and NYFIX. On a constant portfolio and constant currency basis, our underlying expense base was down $195 million, or 11% when compared to full-year 2008. As we move into 2010, our new initiatives are gaining traction, we are aggressively moving forward with the NYFIX integration and we expect to realize the full-year benefit from cost reduction programs launched in 2009."
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $151 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $137 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2009 exclude $44 million in merger expenses and exit costs and the favorable impact of the requisite reversal of discrete tax reserves. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2008 exclude $94 million in pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs and a pre-tax $1,590 million non-cash charge, primarily for the impairment of certain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Non-GAAP net income for the full-year 2009 was $533 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $763 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, for the full-year 2008. In addition to the items excluded above, non-GAAP results also exclude activity assessment and Section 31 fees. A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables.

To supplement NYSE Euronext's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and to better reflect period-over-period comparisons, NYSE Euronext uses non-GAAP financial measures of performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not replace and are not superior to the presentation of GAAP financial results, but are provided to (i) present the effects of certain merger expenses, exit costs and other special items, and (ii) improve overall understanding of NYSE Euronext's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, NYSE Euronext believes the non-GAAP financial results provide useful information to both management and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to financial condition and operating results. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing financial results and evaluating financial performance. The non-GAAP adjustments for all periods presented are based upon information and assumptions available as of the date of this release.
