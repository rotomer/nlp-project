Financial and Operating Highlights

NEW YORK  May 4, 2010  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $130 million, or $0.50 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $104 million, or $0.40 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009. Results for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 include $13 million and $23 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. Excluding the impact of these items, net income in the first quarter of 2010 was $140 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $112 million, or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.
"Our solid first quarter results were driven by strong growth from our derivatives businesses and the first full-quarter's impact of the NYFIX acquisition," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We will look to build on this growth with the anticipated regulatory approval and planned third quarter 2010 launch of New York Portfolio Clearing, coinciding with the launch of interest rate futures contracts on NYSE Liffe U.S. and with the go-live of our new data centers in the second-half of the year, which will drive new revenue for our NYSE Technologies business."
The table below summarizes our results:

Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext, commented, "In the first quarter, we continued to execute on those areas of our business we can control and are seeing tangible results. Our new businesses are driving increased revenue, we reduced costs by 10% on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis and we continued to de-lever with debt to EBITDA levels declining to 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2009. Lastly, the additional transparency of our new segment reporting has served to highlight the strength and diversification of NYSE Euronext for the investment community."
FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenue less transaction-based expenses (Net Revenue), which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees, were $645 million in the first quarter of 2010, up 7% compared to $605 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2009 was primarily driven by a 11% increase in net transaction and clearing revenue and a 58% increase in technology services revenue, partially offset by declines in market data and revenue from BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. First quarter 2010 net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2009 include a $21 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Fixed operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $427 million, compared to $422 million in the first quarter of 2009.
