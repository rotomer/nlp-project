Second quarter of 2010 results also include a net $54 million pre-tax gain from disposal activities. Excluding the impact of these items, net income in the second quarter of 2010 was $167 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $132 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
NEW YORK  August 3, 2010 
"Our strong second quarter results were driven by robust trading volumes, strong revenue generation from new initiatives across our segments and continued cost discipline," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "And building upon the initial steps taken with the creation of NYSE Liffe Clearing in 2009, we announced our new clearing strategy to develop clearinghouses in London and Paris by the end of 2012. As we move through the remainder of the year, we are focused on further strengthening our competitive position and seamlessly migrating markets and clients to our new data centers, which will serve as the liquidity hubs of the future and create unparalleled low-latency trading communities for market participants. The launch of our new data centers is integral to the implementation of our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, connecting members of the capital markets community to our networks and delivering innovative products to our ever expanding client base."

"During the quarter, we continued to invest in new business initiatives that will drive our future growth and further reduced our fixed operating expenses," commented Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext. "On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, our fixed operating expenses declined $29 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2009. Due to the strengthening of the dollar, we are revising downward our cost guidance and now expect full-year 2010 fixed operating expenses to be between $1,685 million and $1,729 million. And lastly, we made significant progress in de-levering, reducing our total debt outstanding by $538 million since the beginning of the year. Reduced debt levels combined with stronger EBITDA generation resulted in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2009."
SECOND QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses (net revenue), which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees, was $654 million in the second quarter of 2010, up $42 million, or 7% compared to $612 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter of 2010 net revenue compared to the second quarter of 2009 included a $19 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. On a currency neutral basis, net revenue would have increased 10%. The increase in net revenue compared to the second quarter of 2009 was primarily driven by a $31 million, or 10% increase in net transaction and clearing revenue, principally related to derivatives trading, and a $26 million, or 53% increase in technology services revenue. These increases were partially offset by declines in revenue from BlueNext (other revenue), our environmental trading exchange, and market data.
Fixed operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $407 million, compared to $397 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter of 2009 fixed operating expenses included a discrete $10 million curtailment benefit for changes implemented to certain U.S. retiree medical
 
plans. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, a $9 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations and investment in new businesses, fixed operating expenses were down $29 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of 2009.
Full-year 2010 fixed operating expenses are now expected to be between $1,685 million and $1,729 million, adjusted for currency fluctuations. The new full-year 2010 fixed operating expense range is based on estimated full-year 2010 average currency rates of EUR/USD $1.30 and GBP/USD $1.50. The previous full-year 2010 fixed operating expense range of $1,723 million and $1,768 million was based on 2009 average foreign currency rates of EUR/USD $1.39 and GBP/USD $1.57.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2010 operating income compared to the second quarter of 2009 includes a $10 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Operating margin was 38%, up from 35% in the second quarter of 2009 and well above the 32% recorded for full-year 2009.
Adjusted EBITDA which excludes merger expenses and exit costs, was $313 million, compared to $281 million in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 46% in the second quarter of 2009.
Non-operating income for the second quarter of 2010 includes the impact of the investment in New York Portfolio Clearing (income from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net income attributable to non-controlling interest) initiatives. Both New York Portfolio Clearing and NYSE Liffe U.S. are currently in a loss position. Non-operating income in the second quarter of 2010 also includes a net pre-tax gain of $54 million related to disposal activities, primarily in connection with the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India (other income).
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 27.5%.
At June 30, 2010, total debt declined $538 million from December 31, 2009 to $2.2 billion and consists of $1.9 billion in long-term debt and $0.3 billion in short-term debt. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and other securities (including $155 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) was $0.4 billion and net debt was $1.8 billion.
Headcount as of June 30, 2010 was 2,993, down 11% from December 31, 2009 and down 15% from June 30, 2009. June 30, 2010 headcount reflects 165 staff transitioned to FINRA as part of their agreement to assume market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter 2010 dividend is payable September 30, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2010. The anticipated ex-date will be September 13, 2010.
