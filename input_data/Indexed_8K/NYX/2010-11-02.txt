Financial and Operating Highlights

NEW YORK  November 2, 2010  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $128 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $125 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009. Results for the third quarter of 2010 include $25 million of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs and a $21 million deferred tax benefit related to the reduction of the UK corporate tax rate. Third quarter 2009 results include $8 million of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs and a $4 million net gain from disposal activities. Excluding the impact of these items, net income in the third quarter of 2010 was $121 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $138 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
"In the third quarter, we continued to execute against our multi-year strategy despite challenging market conditions," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We launched new data centers in the U.S. and Europe which will serve as the liquidity hubs of the future, we are establishing innovative clearing platforms across our markets and providing listed clients with new value-add services through the acquisition of Corporate Board Member. We are creating an unparalleled community, by operating the most important capital markets in the world, connecting customers across our broad distribution network, delivering innovative products and services and enabling customers to leverage our technology and scale to operate their businesses more effectively."

"Our results in the third quarter reflect the impact of dampened transaction revenue due to slow overall industry volumes," commented Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext. "Despite lackluster near-term volume trends, we are focusing on those areas of our business model that are within our control. We are maintaining market share across our primary venues, we continue to develop additional cylinders of growth with new initiatives and our technology services business, we are continuing to reduce our fixed-cost base and are focused on better managing our capital for the benefit of our shareholders. On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, our fixed expenses were down $26 million, or 6% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and we expect to be below the low-end of our full-year fixed cost range."
THIRD QUARTER 2010 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues less transaction-based expenses (net revenue), which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees, was $599 million in the third quarter of 2010, down $22 million, or 4% compared to $621 million in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2009 included a $25 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. On a currency neutral basis, net revenue in the third quarter of 2010 would have been slightly above third quarter of 2009 levels. The decrease in net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2009 was primarily driven by a $35 million, or 11% decrease in net transaction and clearing revenue, related to European cash and derivatives trading, partially offset by a $23 million, or 39% increase in technology services revenue.
Fixed operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $419 million, compared to $426 million in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, a $13 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations and investment in new businesses, fixed operating expenses were down $26 million, or 6%, compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Full-year 2010 fixed operating expenses are now expected to be below the low-end of the currency adjusted full-year range of $1,707 million and $1,749 million. The currency adjusted full-year 2010 fixed operating expense range is based on current EUR/USD and GBP/USD currency rates, which derive full-year 2010 average currency rates of EUR/USD $1.34 and GBP/USD $1.55. The original full-year 2010 fixed operating expense range was $1,723 million and $1,768 million and was based on 2009 average foreign currency rates of EUR/USD $1.39 and GBP/USD $1.57.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $180 million, down $15 million, or 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and included a $12 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. On a
 
currency neutral basis, operating income in the third quarter of 2010 would have decreased 2% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
Adjusted EBITDA which excludes merger expenses and exit costs, was $249 million, compared to $261 million in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% in the third quarter of 2010, in-line with the third quarter of 2009.
Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2010 includes the impact of the investment in New York Portfolio Clearing (income from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss/income attributable to non-controlling interest) initiatives. Both New York Portfolio Clearing and NYSE Liffe U.S. are currently in a loss position.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2010 was 24.2% compared to 21.7% in the third quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 includes the impact of advance tax rulings following the adoption of favorable tax laws in the Netherlands, lowering the estimated full-year effective tax rate from 27.5% to 26.5% which added $0.02 to third quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2009 included the favorable impact of an effective tax rate true-up, which added $0.03 to third quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the Company is projected to be 26.5% for the remainder of 2010.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2010 was 262 million shares, up from 260 million shares in the third quarter of 2009 and 261 million shares in the second quarter of 2010. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be 262 million shares for the remainder of 2010.
At September 30, 2010, total debt declined $0.2 billion from December 31, 2009 to $2.5 billion and consists of $2.1 billion in long-term debt and $0.4 billion in short-term debt. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and other securities (including $23 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) was $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion.
Headcount as of September 30, 2010 was 3,030 (including 34 staff from Corporate Board Member) down 10% from December 31, 2009 and down 11% from September 30, 2009.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter 2010 dividend is payable December 31, 2010 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2010. The anticipated ex-date will be December 13, 2010.
