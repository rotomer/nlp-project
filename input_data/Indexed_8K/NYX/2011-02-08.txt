NEW YORK  Feb. 8, 2011  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $135 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $172 million, or $0.66 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Results for the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter of 2009 include $18 million and $43 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs as well as the impact of the requisite reversal of discrete tax reserves. Excluding the impact of these items, net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $120 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $151 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
"2010 was a year of significant progress for NYSE Euronext in executing on our key strategic priorities and accelerating the transformation of our business," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We made significant investments in key business areas such as our new data centers, New York Portfolio Clearing and our Universal Trading Platform, and in 2011 our focus will be on leveraging these investments to continue to drive success for our customers and shareholders."

Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext commented, "Despite a challenging trading volume environment in the second half of 2010, we recorded record volumes in our derivatives business for full-year 2010, we stabilized our core cash markets, our listings business showed renewed strength, our technology business is primed for growth in 2011 and we continued to focus on reducing our fixed expense base. For the full-year 2010, fixed
 
expenses were below the low-end of our full-year guidance range and included significant investments in new business initiatives which generated incremental revenue of approximately $150 million. On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, our fixed expenses were down $113 million, or 7% compared to full-year 2009."
FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2010 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), was $613 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down $27 million, or 4% compared to $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The $27 million decrease in net revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily driven by declines in European Derivatives and U.S. cash average daily trading volumes (ADV) and a $19 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher technology services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full-year 2010, net revenues were $2,511 million, an increase of $33 million, or 1% compared to $2,478 million for full-year 2009. The $33 million increase was driven primarily by the full-year effect of NYSE Liffe Clearing, the acquisition of NYFIX and increased market share on NYSE Amex options, partially offset by reductions in European cash pricing, a $42 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations and declines in trading volumes over BlueNext, NYSE Euronext's environmental trading platform in Europe.
Fixed operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $425 million, compared to $431 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, an $8 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations and investment in new businesses, fixed operating expenses were down $25 million, or 6%, compared to fourth quarter 2009. For the full-year 2010, fixed operating expenses were $1,678 million compared to $1,676 million in 2009. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, a $19 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations and investment in new businesses, fixed operating expenses were down $113 million, or 7%, compared to full-year 2009.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $188 million, down $21 million, or 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and included an $11 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. For the full-year 2010, operating income was $833 million, compared to $802 million for full-year 2009 and included a $25 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger expenses and exit costs, was $268 million, compared to $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full-year 2010, adjusted EBITDA was $1,114 million, compared to $1,068 million for full-year 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44% in the fourth quarter and full-year 2010, slightly above the 43% recorded in the fourth quarter and full-year 2009.
Non-operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 includes the impact of the investment in New York Portfolio Clearing (income from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss/income attributable to non-controlling interest) initiatives. Both New York Portfolio Clearing and NYSE Liffe U.S. are currently in a loss position. Non-operating income in the fourth quarter of 2009 included a $0.06 per diluted share positive impact from an LCH.Clearnet special dividend (other income) as well as the impact of the sale of stakes in NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss/income attributable to non-controlling interest) which resulted in the retroactive sharing of losses with our partners.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 was approximately 26.5%.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 were 262 million shares, up from 261 million shares in the fourth quarter and full-year 2009.
At December 31, 2010, total debt declined $0.3 billion from December 31, 2009 to $2.4 billion and consists of $2.1 billion in long-term debt and $0.3 billion in short-term debt. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and other securities (including $98 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) was $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.0 billion.
Headcount as of December 31, 2010 was 2,968, down 2% from September 30, 2010 and down 12% from December 31, 2009.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2011. The first quarter 2011 dividend is payable March 31, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2011. The anticipated ex-date will be March 14, 2011.
 
FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2010 SEGMENT RESULTS
Below is a summary of business segment results:
 
 
DERIVATIVES
Derivatives net revenue of $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 decreased $12 million, or 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a $7 million negative impact from currency fluctuations and an 8% decline in European derivatives ADV, partially offset by a $4 million, or 10% increase in U.S. options net transaction revenue driven by a 20% increase in U.S. equity options ADV. For the full-year 2010, Derivatives net revenue of $826 million increased $103 million, or 14%, and represented 33% of NYSE Euronext's total net revenue, up from 29% in 2009. The strong annual performance was driven by record European derivatives ADV, which increased 15%, the full-year effect of NYSE Liffe Clearing and strong U.S. options ADV which increased 39% compared to full-year 2009, partially offset by a $13 million negative impact from currency fluctuations.
 
 
 
 
CASH TRADING AND LISTINGS
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $24 million, or 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a 13% decline in U.S. cash ADV, year-over-year pricing changes in European cash and a $9 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. For the full-year 2010, net revenue of $1,241 million decreased $145 million, or 10%, and represented 49% of NYSE Euronext's full-year 2010 net revenue, down from 56% in 2009. The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by pricing reductions in European cash in 2009, declines in trading volumes over BlueNext, NYSE Euronext's environmental trading platform in Europe, declines in U.S. cash ADV and a $21 million negative impact from currency fluctuations.
 
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $11 million, or 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue resulting from the launch of the Mahwah and Basildon data-centers, strong enterprise software sales and the impact of the NYFIX acquisition and was partially offset by a $3 million negative impact from currency fluctuations. For the full-year 2010, revenue of $444 million increased $81 million, or 22%, and represented 18% of NYSE Euronext's total net revenue, up from 15% in 2009. The increase in revenue was driven by the impact of the NYFIX acquisition and increased Exchange Solutions, SFTI and software sales, partially offset by a $7 negative impact from currency fluctuations.
