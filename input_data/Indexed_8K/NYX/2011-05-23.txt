ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
 
On May 17, 2011, Alpha Beta Netherlands Holding N.V. ("Holdco") filed a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the U.S. Exchange Offer Prospectus, originally filed on May 4, 2011, for the exchange offer in which U.S. shareholders of Deutsche Brse AG ("Deutsche Brse") have been offered one share of Holdco in exchange for each Deutsche Brse share as part of the business combination between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Brse.  The Prospectus Supplement contains details of updated revenue synergies first announced at the Deutsche Brse annual general meeting.
 
The Prospectus Supplement details 50 million of additional revenue synergies, for a total of 150 million aggregate revenue synergies, that are expected to be achieved annually following completion of the combination, with the full run-rate expected to be achieved at end of the third year following completion. It is expected that approximately one-third of the total revenue synergies would be from clearing alone, and that the remaining 100 million would be realized in the other business areas indicated below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safe Harbour Statement
 
In connection with the proposed business combination transaction between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG, Alpha Beta Netherlands Holding N.V. ("Holding"), a newly formed holding company, has filed, and the SEC has declared effective on May 3, 2011, a Registration Statement on Form F-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that includes (1) a proxy statement of NYSE Euronext that will also constitute a prospectus for Holding and (2) an offering prospectus of Holding to be used in connection with Holding's offer to acquire Deutsche Boerse AG shares held by U.S. holders. Holding has also filed an offer document with the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt fuer Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) ("BaFin"), which was approved by the BaFin for publication pursuant to the German Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs-und bernahmegesetz), and was published on May 4, 2011.
 
Investors and security holders are urged to read the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, the offering prospectus and the offer document regarding the proposed business combination transaction because they contain important information. You may obtain a free copy of the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, the offering prospectus and other related documents filed by NYSE Euronext and Holding with the SEC on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus and other documents relating thereto may also be obtained for free by accessing NYSE Euronext's Web site at www.nyse.com. The offer document is available at Holding's Web site at www.global-exchange-operator.com.
 
This document is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of Holding, Deutsche Boerse AG or NYSE Euronext. The final terms and further provisions regarding the public offer are disclosed in the offer document that has been approved by the BaFin and in documents that have been filed with the SEC.
 
No offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable European regulations. Subject to certain exceptions to be approved by the relevant regulators or certain facts to be ascertained, the public offer is not being made directly or indirectly in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, or by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality (including without limitation, facsimile transmission, telephone and the internet) of interstate or foreign commerce, or any facility of a national securities exchange, of any such jurisdiction.
 
This announcement and related materials do not constitute in France an offer for ordinary shares in Holding. The relevant final terms of the proposed business combination transaction will be disclosed in the information documents reviewed by the competent European market authorities.

NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Boerse AG, Holding and their respective directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in
