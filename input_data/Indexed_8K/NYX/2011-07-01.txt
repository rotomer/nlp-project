ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
 
            BlueNext S.A. (BlueNext), a joint venture that NYSE Euronext (the Company) indirectly holds with Caisse des Dpts, has informed the Company that BlueNext has received notice from the French Tax Authorities of a tax reassessment arising from a tax audit for the period January 2006 through May 2009.  The asserted liability, including penalties, is 355 million.
 
            This reassessment concerns claimed negligence of BlueNext relating to value-added tax frauds allegedly committed prior to May 2009 by certain third-party participants in the CO2 market operated by BlueNext.
 
            BlueNext originally discovered these alleged frauds (in which BlueNext has not been implicated) and reported them to the French Authorities in 2008. BlueNext has since then been cooperating with these Authorities. 
 
               BlueNext has informed the Company that the discussion with French Tax Authorities are ongoing and that it intends to vigorously defend itself against this reassessment.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
