NYSE Euronext (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8K/A to the Company's Current Report on Form 8K dated April 28, 2011, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 2, 2011, to disclose the decision of the Board of Directors of the Company regarding how frequently to hold a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation.
ITEM 5.07 SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
As previously disclosed, at the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 28, 2011, a majority of the Company's stockholders voted, on an advisory non-binding basis, to hold an advisory non-binding vote to approve executive compensation every year. Consistent with this recommendation by the Company's stockholders, the Board of Directors has decided that it will include an advisory non-binding shareholder vote on executive compensation in its proxy materials every year until the next required vote on the frequency of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
