Financial and Operating Highlights
1, 2
 
NEW YORK  August 2, 2011  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $154 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011, compared to net income of $184 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2010. Results for the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 include $18 million and $32 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. The $18 million in merger expenses and exit costs in the second quarter of 2011 included $12 million related to the proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse. Second quarter of 2010 results also included a net $54 million pre-tax gain from disposal activities. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items, net income in the second quarter of 2011 was $160 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $167 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010.
"Our solid results in the second quarter reflect our focus on revenue diversification, disciplined cost management and balance sheet strength as we continue to execute against our long-term strategy in an extremely challenging environment," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "NYSE Liffe U.S. continues to gain traction with the launch of Eurodollar and U.S. treasury futures, we closed the sale of stakes in NYSE Amex Options and we were the global leader in IPOs for the second consecutive quarter, with a growing share of technology IPOs selecting NYSE. Lastly, our technology services business, which grew revenue 14% year-over-year, launched the first cloud computing platform in financial services.
"I would like to thank the shareholders of both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse for their overwhelming support of our pending combination. Integration planning is on schedule and we continue to cooperate with all our regulators as we prepare for a closing by end of 2011."
The table below summarizes the financial results
1
for the second quarter of 2011:
 
 
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext commented, "In the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our commitments to shareholders. Revenues year-to-date are running 3% above prior year levels and fixed operating expenses on a constant dollar/portfolio basis are running 4% below prior year, despite increased costs accompanying higher technology revenues. As a result of our strong free cash flow generation and lower capital expenditures, we retired our outstanding commercial paper which lowered our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 1.7 times in the second quarter. Our financial position continues to strengthen as we move forward with the final phase of our combination with Deutsche Boerse."
SECOND QUARTER 2011 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), was $661 million in the second quarter of 2011, up $7 million, or 1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and included a $33 million positive impact from currency fluctuations. The $7 million increase in net revenue compared to the second quarter of 2010 was driven by a $30 million increase in non-trading revenue which more than offset a $23 million decrease in net trading revenues, driven primarily by declines in European derivatives and U.S. cash equity average daily trading volume ("ADV"). Second quarter of 2010 ADV across all venues was marked by unseasonally strong trading volumes due to heightened market volatility driven by the advent of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the flash crash in the United States.
Other operating expenses, which exclude merger expenses and exit costs, were $419 million in the second quarter of 2011, up $12 million, or 3% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, new initiatives and a $17 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, fixed operating expenses were down $14 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $242 million, down $5 million, or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and included a $16 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger expenses and exit costs, was $312 million, in-line with the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47% in the second quarter of 2011, compared to 48% in the second quarter of 2010.
Non-operating income for the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 includes the impact of the New York Portfolio Clearing (loss/income from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss/income attributable to non-controlling interest) initiatives which are currently in a loss position, but are moving toward profitability as trading volumes and open interest continue to grow. Non-operating income in the second quarter of 2010 includes a net pre-tax gain of $54 million related to disposal activities, primarily in connection with the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India (other income). With the closing of the sale of stakes in the NYSE Amex Options business, beginning with the third quarter of 2011, profits generated by NYSE Amex Options will be shared with our partners (net loss/income attributable to non-controlling
 
interest). Had the sale closed on April 1, 2011, diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $0.02 in the second quarter of 2011.
For the second quarter of 2011, the effective tax rate, excluding merger expenses, exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items, was approximately 26% compared to 27% in the second quarter of 2010.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2011 was 263 million, up from 261 million shares in the second quarter of 2010. Approximately 0.3 million shares were issued in the second quarter of 2011 to former Amex members in connection with the sale of the former American Stock Exchange headquarters.
At June 30, 2011, total debt of $2.2 billion was $0.2 million below December 31, 2010 levels driven by the elimination of $0.2 billion in commercial paper during the second quarter of 2011. Cash, cash equivalents, investments and other securities (including $172 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) was $0.4 billion and net debt was $1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter 2011.
The ratio of debt-to-EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011 declined to 1.7 times, the lowest level since the establishment of NYSE Euronext in April 2007.
Total capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2011 were $31 million, compared to $70 million in the second quarter of 2010. Through the first-half of 2011, capital expenditures were $67 million consistent with full-year 2011 guidance of capital expenditures of less than $200 million.
Headcount as of June 30, 2011 was 2,988, down 1% from March 31, 2011 and down slightly from June 30, 2010 levels despite several acquisitions.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2011. The third quarter 2011 dividend is payable September 30, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 15, 2011. The anticipated ex-date will be September 13, 2011.
SECOND QUARTER 2011 SEGMENT RESULTS
Below is a summary of business segment results:
 
 
DERIVATIVES
Derivatives net revenue of $213 million in the second quarter of 2011 decreased $13 million, or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and included a $15 million positive impact from currency fluctuations. The $13 million decrease in Derivatives net revenue compared to the second quarter of 2010, was driven by a $13 million, or 8% decrease in European derivatives net trading revenue on a 20% decline in ADV.
 
 
 
 
 
CASH TRADING AND LISTINGS
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue of $327 million in the second quarter of 2011 increased $6 million, or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and included a $13 million positive impact from currency fluctuations. The $6 million increase in net revenue compared to the second quarter of 2010, was primarily driven by a $14 million increase in non-trading related revenue, principally listings and other revenue which more than offset a decline in net trading revenue. The decline in net trading revenue was primarily driven by a 36% decrease in U.S. cash equities ADV, partially offset by a 32% increase in average net revenue per 100 shares handled due to higher fees and favorable business mix.
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $122 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $15 million, or 14% compared to the second quarter of 2010 and included a $5 million positive impact from currency fluctuations. The $15 million increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2010, was primarily driven by an increase in infrastructure revenue, principally SFTI and data center fees.
