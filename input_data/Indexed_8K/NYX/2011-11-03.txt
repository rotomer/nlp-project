NEW YORK  November 3, 2011  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $200 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011, compared to net income of $128 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2010. Results for the third quarter of 2011 and 2010 include $29 million and $25 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. The $29 million in merger expenses and exit costs in the third quarter of 2011 included $19 million related to the proposed merger with Deutsche Boerse AG. In the third quarter of 2011, our GAAP effective tax rate included a discrete deferred tax benefit of approximately $40 million related to the enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate from 27% to 25% in the United Kingdom. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items, net income in the third quarter of 2011 was $186 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $121 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010.
"Our strong third quarter results benefited from unseasonably strong trading volumes, as well as our continuing business diversification efforts," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "Non-trading related net revenue was up $30 million year-over-year, driven by growth in our technology services businesses and the increasing momentum we are experiencing in our global listings franchise.
"We are moving forward with our merger with Deutsche Boerse and have just recently conducted a hearing before the Directorate General for Competition of the European Commission. At the hearing, both companies were able to crystallize the compelling nature of our merger, which will bring significant benefits to customers, regulators and intermediaries. Furthermore, given the strong prospects for growth for investors as a result of our proposed merger and the company's current valuation, we recently announced a plan to acquire up to $100 million in stock in the fourth quarter, as part of our Board authorized stock buy-back program."
The table below summarizes the financial results

for the third quarter of 2011:
 
 
"Continued cost discipline during the quarter well-positioned the company to capture the full benefit of higher trading volumes across all venues, with our operating margin increasing to 41% and our incremental margin exceeding 100%, reflecting the strong operating leverage in our model," Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext, commented. "On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, our expenses year-to-date are running $53 million, or 4% below the prior year period and we are confident that we will achieve our previously announced full-year 2011 expense guidance of less than $1.650 billion on the same basis.
"Additionally, with over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA generated in the first 9 months of the year and debt-to-EBITDA level of 1.6 times, our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we prepare for our merger with Deutsche Boerse. As a result of our strong performance and our continuing focus on creating value for our shareholders, we are buying back up to $100 million in stock, on top of the attractive stream of dividends that we expect to pay out to investors in conjunction with our merger."
THIRD QUARTER 2011 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), was $704 million in the third quarter of 2011, up $105 million, or 18% compared to the third quarter of 2010 and included a $23 million positive impact from currency fluctuations. The $105 million increase in net revenue compared to the third quarter of 2010 was driven by a $75 million, or 27% increase in trading revenue on strong average daily trading volumes ("ADV") across all trading venues and a $30 million, or 9% increase in non-trading related revenue.
Other operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $416 million in the third quarter of 2011, down $3 million, or 1% compared to the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, new initiatives and a $10 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, fixed operating expenses were down $21 million, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2010.
Based on results through the third quarter of 2011, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, the Company expects to achieve its guidance for full-year 2011 operating expenses of less than $1,650 million on a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis. For the full-year 2011, we anticipate incremental costs from portfolio changes of approximately $28 million (Corporate Board Member, NYSE Blue and Metabit), as well as incremental costs from currency fluctuations of approximately $30 million assuming currency rates remain at year-to-date 2011 averages. Factoring in these portfolio changes and the impact of currency fluctuations, full-year 2011 expenses are expected to be approximately $1,680 million.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $288 million, up $108 million, or 60% compared to the third quarter of 2010 and included a $13 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $360 million, up $111 million, or 45% compared to the third quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51% in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 42% in the third quarter of 2010. Year-to-date, the Company has generated over $1.0 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $159 million, or 19% more than the prior year period.
 
Non-operating income for the third quarter of 2011 and 2010 includes the impact of New York Portfolio Clearing (loss from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss attributable to non-controlling interest). Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, profits generated by NYSE Amex Options are now being shared with our partners (net income attributable to non-controlling interest). The profit attributable to the non-controlling interest related to NYSE Amex Options was $11 million in the third quarter of 2011, based on the sale of a 52.8% stake in the business. During the third quarter of 2011, approximately 10% of the ownership stake held by NYSE Amex Options partners was put-back to NYSE Euronext, reducing the equity stake held by partners to 47.5%.
The effective tax rate for the full-year 2011 was lowered in the third quarter of 2011 from 26.0% to 25.75%, partially as a result of the NYSE Amex Options semi-mutualization, resulting in an effective tax rate (excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items) of 25.0% for the third quarter of 2011. The 24.2% effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 included the impact of advance tax rulings following the adoption of favorable tax laws in the Netherlands, which lowered the estimated full-year effective tax rate in 2010 from 27.5% to 26.5%.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2011 was 263 million shares, up from 262 million shares in the third quarter of 2010.
At September 30, 2011, total debt of $2.1 billion was $0.3 billion below December 31, 2010 levels driven primarily by lower commercial paper outstanding. Cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments (including $37 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) were $0.4 billion and net debt was $1.7 billion at the end of the third quarter 2011.
The ratio of debt-to-EBITDA in the third quarter of 2011 declined to 1.6 times, the lowest level since the establishment of NYSE Euronext in April 2007.
Total capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2011 were $49 million, compared to $82 million in the third quarter of 2010. Through the first three quarters of 2011, capital expenditures were $116 million compared to $244 million in 2010 and are now expected to be well below the full-year 2011 guidance of less than $200 million.
Headcount as of September 30, 2011, which includes incremental hires for our growing technology services business and 36 new employees from the Metabit acquisition, was 3,074 up 3% from June 30, 2011 and up 2% from September 30, 2010 levels.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2011. The third quarter 2011 dividend is payable on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2011. The anticipated ex-date will be December 13, 2011.
