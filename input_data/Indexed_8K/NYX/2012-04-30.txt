NEW YORK  April 30, 2012  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $87 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $155 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2011. Results for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 include $31 million and $21 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. The $31 million in merger expenses and exit costs in the first quarter of 2012 included $16 million related to the terminated merger with Deutsche Boerse AG. In the first quarter of 2012, the GAAP effective tax rate included the release of a non-cash reserve related to a favorable settlement with the UK tax authorities, which was more than offset by a discrete, non-cash tax expense. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items, net income in the first quarter of 2012 was $121 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $177 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011.
"Our first quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment which carried over into 2012 and will continue to result in near-term headwinds," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "Looking ahead into 2013 and 2014, we are focused on creating value by enhancing the underlying earnings power of the Company and solidly executing on the three core pillars of our earnings growth strategy outlined at our investor day: capturing growth opportunities in new markets and leveraging inter-asset class opportunities; delivering efficiencies through disciplined cost management and optimizing our shared services infrastructure; and strategically deploying our capital."
 
The table below summarizes the financial results1 for the first quarter of 2012:
 
 
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext, commented, "Despite the tough quarter, we are executing our earnings growth strategy. This quarter we made progress with the build-out of clearing, reduced our shares outstanding, unwound NYSE Blue and reported lower costs. These efforts will provide greater operating leverage when macro trends return to more historical norms."
FIRST QUARTER 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), were $601 million in the first quarter of 2012, down $78 million, or 11% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and included a $9 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $78 million decrease in net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower average daily volumes ("ADV") across all trading venues.
Other operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $405 million in the first quarter of 2012, down $10 million, or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of new business initiatives ("NBIs") and a $5 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, other operating expenses were down $12 million, or 3%, compared to the first quarter of 2011.
For the full-year 2012 core expenses, excluding NBIs, are targeted to be between $1,580 million and $1,600 million compared to $1,666 million for full-year 2011. Incremental expenses from NBIs in 2012, including the build-out of clearing for European derivatives ($15 million) and the investment in a new contract-for-differences business in Europe ($12 million) as well as variable costs related to increases in NYSE Technologies revenue ($20-$25 million) are expected to result in a full-year 2012 expense guidance range of $1,627 million to $1,652 million assuming constant foreign currency rates of EURO / USD $1.35 and GBP / USD $1.60.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $196 million, down $68 million, or 26% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and included a $4 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding merger expenses and exit costs was $262 million, down $72 million, or 21% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to 49% in the first quarter of 2011.
Non-operating income for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 includes the impact of New York Portfolio Clearing (loss from associates) and NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss attributable to non-controlling interest). NYSE Liffe U.S. is expected to achieve profitability in 2013. The profit attributable to the non-controlling interest related to NYSE Amex Options was $8 million in the first quarter of 2012, based on our partners' 47.5% stake in the business. The semi-mutualization of the NYSE Amex Options business was closed late in the second quarter of 2011.
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2012, excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items, was approximately 25% compared to approximately 26% for the first quarter of 2011. The lower effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was principally driven by the reduction of the UK corporate tax rate from 26% to 25%, a settlement with the UK tax authorities resulting in a more favorable tax position in the UK and lower taxes related to the reorganization of certain U.S. businesses.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2012 was 259 million shares, down from 262 million shares in first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, a total of 4.3 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.73 per share. The current $552 million stock repurchase authorization has $425 million remaining as of March 31, 2012.
At March 31, 2012, total debt of $2.1 billion was slightly above December 31, 2011 levels. Cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments (including $67 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) were $0.4 billion and net debt was $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2012. The ratio of debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was 2.0.
Total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2012 were $43 million, compared to $35 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the full-year 2012, capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $200 million which is expected to include approximately $30 million for the build-out of derivatives clearing in Europe.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the second quarter of 2012. The second quarter 2012 dividend is payable on June 29, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2012. The anticipated ex-date will be June 13, 2012.
FIRST QUARTER 2012 SEGMENT RESULTS
Below is a summary of business segment results:
 
 
DERIVATIVES
Derivatives net revenue of $176 million in the first quarter of 2012 decreased $60 million, or 25% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and included a $3 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $60 million decrease in derivatives net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2011, was driven by lower trading volumes as well as reduced pricing for individual equity options and index futures and options on NYSE Liffe in Amsterdam and Belgium.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CASH TRADING AND LISTINGS
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue of $304 million in the first quarter of 2012 decreased $24 million, or 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and included a $4 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $24 million decrease in net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower trading volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $121 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $5 million, or 4% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and included a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $5 million increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2011, was driven by higher connectivity revenue related to our Mahwah data center and incremental revenue from the Metabit acquisition. The overall market for technology services is experiencing some weakness, as the challenging environment for financial services has delayed client decisions on purchases of software and connectivity services. Furthermore, the first quarter of the year is traditionally a slower quarter for technology services sales.
