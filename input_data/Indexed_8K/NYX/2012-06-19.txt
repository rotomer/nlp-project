ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

The Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes. On the effective date, no borrowings were funded or letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.
The commitments under the Credit Agreement terminate, and all amounts thereunder become due, on the three-year anniversary of the effective date (subject to certain extension options described in the Credit Agreement). NYSE Euronext may elect to have revolving loans under the Credit Agreement borrowed or standby letters of credit issued in various currencies, including U.S. dollars, English pounds sterling, or Euros, with various interest rate options. In addition, NYSE Euronext will pay a facility fee ranging from 0.065% to 0.15% per annum of the committed amount under the Credit Agreement, based on the credit ratings of NYSE Euronext's senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness having no credit support.
The Credit Agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations and warranties (including, but not limited to, those relating to organization and authorization and compliance with laws), customary affirmative covenants (including, but not limited to, delivery of financial statements), negative covenants relating to liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries and fundamental changes, and customary events of default (including, but not limited to, payment defaults, covenant defaults, and bankruptcy events). The Credit Agreement requires that NYSE Euronext maintain a minimum Total Stockholders' Equity (as adjusted for accumulated other comprehensive income and as defined in the Credit Agreement) of at least $5.507 billion.
In addition, on June 15, 2012, NYSE Euronext terminated its existing five year Credit Agreement, dated as of April 4, 2007, by and among NYSE Euronext, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, and the other financial institutions party thereto as agents.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the relevant Administrative Agent's Account, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
Payments by Borrowers
(ii) Prior to any prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the relevant Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of a Borrowing in any Agreed Foreign Currency or any Borrowing by any Non-U.S. Subsidiary Borrower, not later than 1:00 p.m., London time), three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment. If the relevant Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied, first, to pay (in the case of Borrowings of any U.S. Borrower) any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first).
(iii) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on any Loan or any Letter of Credit in any Agreed Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15, all amounts owing under this Agreement (including facility fees, payments required under Section 2.14 and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan or any Letter of Credit in Dollars) are payable in Dollars. All amounts with respect to principal of and interest on any Loan or any Letter of Credit in any Agreed Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15 are payable in such Agreed Foreign Currency.
(b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
Application of Insufficient Payments
 
applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Revolving Borrowing under any Tranche shall be made from the Lenders under such Tranche and shall be allocated pro rata among such Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Tranche (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Revolving Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions or continuations of Revolving Loans); (ii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans under any Tranche by the relevant Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders under such Tranche pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving Loans under such Tranche held by them; and (iii) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans, and each payment of facility fees and Letter of Credit fees, under any Tranche by the relevant Borrower shall be made for account of the Lenders under such Tranche pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Revolving Loans or such fees, as the case may be, then due and payable under such Tranche to the respective Lenders.
Pro Rata Treatment
(d) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the relevant Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
(e) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due by such
Presumptions of Payment
 
Borrower to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or any Issuing Lender hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, calculated at a rate of interest determined by the Administrative Agent to reflect its cost of funds.
(f) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or participations in Letters of Credit (as applicable) or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(v) in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

If the designation of such Subsidiary Borrower obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or other similar checks and identification requirements and procedures under any applicable laws, rules and regulations with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall (or shall cause such Subsidiary Borrower to), promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender (through the Administrative Agent), supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to comply therewith.

organization (an ""), or whose internal policies preclude any such lending, establishing credit and/or doing business with respect to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary, may object to the designation of such Non-U.S. Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder by notifying the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof in writing (a ""); that (i) any Lender which is relying solely on such internal policies as the basis for providing such an objection may provide a Lender Objection Notice only if such policies are being applied by such Lender to all similarly situated borrowers seeking loans or other extensions of credit from or with respect to doing business in such jurisdiction; (ii) prior to the delivery of a Lender Objection Notice, each Lender that may be an Objecting Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate (or identify) a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary hereunder or to assign (or identify for purposes of assignment of) its rights and obligations hereunder to make its Loans to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate the need for a Lender Objection Notice and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender (and the Company and the relevant Non-U.S. Subsidiary Borrower hereby agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment); and (iii) if, pursuant to clause (ii) above, such Lender shall assign its rights and obligations hereunder to make its Loans to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary hereunder to an Affiliate, such Lender shall, to the extent of Loans made to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary Borrower, be deemed for all purposes hereof to have assigned such Loans to such Affiliate in compliance with the provisions of Section 9.04 ( that, at the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender and such Affiliate shall deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such deemed assignment). In the event that the Company and the Administrative Agent receive a Lender Objection Notice with respect to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary that has not been withdrawn by the applicable Objecting Lender, the Company may not deliver a Subsidiary Borrower Designation with respect to such Non-U.S. Subsidiary Borrower under paragraph (b) of this Section.

(B) If a Defaulting Lender is a Multicurrency Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit fees pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.11(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.21.
(C) With respect to any facility fee or any such Letter of Credit fees not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Company (or relevant Borrower, as applicable) shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender which is a Multicurrency Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender's participation in LC Exposure that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Lender the amount of any such Letter of Credit fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lender's Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv) . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender's participation in LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders which are Multicurrency Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Company shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Company shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the total Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation.
Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure

If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders' Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.21.

New Letters of Credit
SECTION 2.23. . (a) . At any time prior to the Tranche Consolidation Date, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, the Lenders shall automatically and without further action be deemed to have exchanged interests in the outstanding Revolving Loans and outstanding Letters of Credit made or issued under their respective Commitments such that, in lieu of the interests of each Lender in each such Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit, such Lender shall hold an interest in all of the Revolving Loans made to the Borrowers and all outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrowers under both Tranches of Commitments at such time, whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender's Exchange Percentage thereof. The foregoing exchanges shall be accomplished automatically pursuant to this Section through purchases and sales of participations in the Revolving Loans and outstanding Letters of Credit as required hereby, which shall be effected solely among or between the Lenders (and without the participation of the Company or any other Borrower), that, at the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender hereby agrees to enter into customary participation agreements approved by the Administrative Agent to evidence the same. All purchases and sales of participating interests pursuant to this Section shall be made in the respective Currency in which such Revolving Loans and/or Letters of Credit are denominated. At the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender which has sold participations in any of its Revolving Loans and outstanding Letters of Credit as provided above (through the Administrative Agent) will deliver to each Lender (through the Administrative Agent) which has so purchased a participating interest therein a participation certificate in the appropriate amount as determined in conjunction with the Administrative Agent. It is understood that the amount of funds delivered in connection therewith by each Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various Lenders as required above.

Participations
provided
 
(b) . All determinations by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall be made by it in accordance with the provisions herein and with the intent being that the Lender shall equitably share the credit risk for all Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit under the Commitments in accordance with the provisions hereof. Absent manifest error, all determinations by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding on the Borrowers, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Borrower, any Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder for any determinations made by it hereunder except to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment).
Determination by Administrative Agent
(c) . Upon, and after, the occurrence of a Sharing Event (a) no further Revolving Loan or issuance, amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit shall be made, (b) all amounts from time to time accruing with respect to, and all amounts from time to time payable on account of, Revolving Loans (including, without limitation, any interest and other amounts which were accrued but unpaid on the date of such Sharing Event) shall be payable in the respective Currency in which such Revolving Loans and/or Letters of Credit are denominated and shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders which made such Revolving Loans or are participating therein and (c) all Commitments shall be automatically terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any Lender to purchase its participating interests as required above in any Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other Lender on any date.
Participation Payments
(d) . If any amount required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to this Section is not paid to the Administrative Agent on the date upon which the Sharing Event occurred, such Lender shall, in addition to such aforementioned amount, also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such Lender for the purchase of its participations, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts payable under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Amounts payable by any Lender pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders; that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such other Lender the amounts owing to such other Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.
Delinquent Participation Payments
provided
(e) . Whenever, at any time after the relevant Lenders have received from any other Lenders purchases of participations pursuant to this Section and the various Lenders receive any payment on account thereof, such Lenders will
Settlement of Participation Payments
 
distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the other Lenders participating therein, such Lenders' participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding) in like funds as received; that in the event that such payment received by any Lenders is required to be returned, the Lenders who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective Lenders any portion thereof previously so distributed to them in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by the respective Lenders.
provided
(f) . Each Lender's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any Borrower, any other Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower, any other Lender, any Issuing Lender or any other Person or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
Participation Obligations Absolute

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and no Borrower shall have any rights as a third-party beneficiary of or obligations pursuant to any such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
 
take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02); that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action at the direction of the requisite Lenders hereunder that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any of the Group Members that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
provided
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition, if any, hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent (and which may include any of its Affiliates). The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Section shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent (it being understood that each such sub-agent, by agreeing to act as a sub-agent hereunder, shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in such capacity in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment)), and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any such bank. If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Company, appoint a successor; that if no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective on such 30

th
day (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. Upon the retirement or removal of the Administrative Agent hereunder, except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. The
 
fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender and Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agents and the Documentation Agents named on the cover page of this Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this Agreement, except in their capacity, if any, as Lenders.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding relating to a Borrower under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or Letter of Credit shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the relevant Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, obligations under Letters of Credit and all other obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 9.03.
