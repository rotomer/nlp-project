Financial and Operating Highlights
1, 2
NEW YORK  August 3, 2012  NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $125 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $154 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011. Results for the second quarter of 2012 and 2011 include $12 million and $18 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. Second quarter 2012 results also include a net $2 million loss from disposal activities related to the previously announced wind down of NYSE Blue. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs, disposal activities and discrete tax items, net income in the second quarter of 2012 was $128 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $160 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011.
"We made good progress in executing against our strategy to unlock the inherent value of our community," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We have realigned our client facing and product teams to create a generalist sales force that brings to bear our full-suite of solutions for our clients. We have given notice that we will fully insource clearing and launch NYSE Clearing in June 2013, which will provide us with cost savings and ultimately provide new revenue and better position the Company for the OTC opportunity. Lastly, we made significant headway with our NYSE Liffe U.S. platform with the launch of our GCF repo futures product which fills the increasing market need for a reliable and transparent benchmark for bank funding costs."

for the second quarter of 2012:
 
"We are making excellent progress on the efficiency and capital deployment streams of Project 14," commented Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext. "Year-to-date, excluding investments and foreign exchange fluctuations, we have reduced operating costs by $35 million, or 4% which puts us on track to exceed our year-one cost savings commitments. On the capital front, we spent $304 million of the $552 million share repurchase authorization, purchasing 11 million shares year-to-date. Ongoing strategic initiatives, combined with our cost reduction plan and lower share count from stock repurchases, should position the Company for a return to earnings growth in 2013 and beyond."
SECOND QUARTER 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), were $602 million in the second quarter of 2012, down $59 million, or 9% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and included a $22 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $37 million decrease in net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower average daily volumes ("ADV"), mostly attributable to the derivatives business.
Other operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $396 million in the second quarter of 2012, down $23 million, or 5% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of new business initiatives and an $11 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, other operating expenses were also down $23 million, or 5%, compared to the second quarter of 2011.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $206 million, down $36 million, or 15% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and included an $11 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding merger expenses and exit costs was $272 million, down $40 million, or 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45% in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 47% in the second quarter of 2011.
Non-operating results for the second quarter of 2012 and 2011 includes the impact of New York Portfolio Clearing (loss from associates), NYSE Liffe U.S. (net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) and NYSE Amex Options (net profit attributable to non-controlling interest). The loss attributable to the non-controlling interest related to NYSE Liffe U.S. was $2 million in the second quarter of 2012, based on the partners' 42% stake in the business. At the end of the second quarter of 2012, NYSE Liffe U.S. sold a 7% equity stake in the business to the existing partner group, raising the partner groups' collective stake in the business to 49%. The profit attributable to the non-controlling interest related to NYSE Amex Options was $8 million in the second quarter of 2012, based on the partners' 47.8% stake in the business.
 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2012, excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items, was approximately 25% compared to approximately 26% for the second quarter of 2011.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 2012 was 253 million, down from 263 million in second quarter of 2011. During the second quarter of 2012, a total of 6.9 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $25.60 per share. The current $552 million stock repurchase authorization has $248 million remaining as of June 30, 2012.
At June 30, 2012, total debt was $2.3 billion. Cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments (including $153 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) were $0.4 billion and net debt was $1.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2012. The ratio of debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the second quarter of 2012 was 2.1X.
NYSE Euronext entered into a $1 billion senior unsecured credit facility agreement with a three-year maturity. The financing replaces NYSE Euronext's existing $1.2 billion credit facility, which was entered into in 2007 and was scheduled to mature on July 31, 2012. The new revolving bank facility is available for general corporate purposes and will mature on June 15, 2015.
Total capital expenditures were $41 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $84 million year-to-date. This is in-line with our full-year 2012 capital expenditures guidance.
Headcount as of June 30, 2012 of 3,062 was 17 below first quarter 2012 levels despite the addition of 99 employees from the acquisition of Corpedia in June of 2012. The reduction was due to the wind down of NYSE Blue (66 headcount) and the ongoing staff rationalization program.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2012. The third quarter 2012 dividend is payable on September 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 14, 2012. The anticipated ex-date will be September 12, 2012.
SECOND QUARTER 2012 SEGMENT RESULTS
Below is a summary of business segment results:
 
DERIVATIVES
Derivatives net revenue of $182 million in the second quarter of 2012 decreased $31 million, or 15% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and included a $6 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $25 million decrease in derivatives net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2011, was driven by lower trading volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
CASH TRADING AND LISTINGS
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue of $300 million in the second quarter of 2012 decreased $27 million, or 8% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and included an $11 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $16 million decrease in net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower average net revenue capture for European cash trading.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $119 million in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $3 million, or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2011 and included a $5 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $2 million increase in revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2011, was driven by higher connectivity revenue. The slower growth in revenue year-over-year is the result of the challenging environment for financial services technology sales which has delayed client decisions on purchases of software and connectivity services.
