In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

however
 
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the
 
 
20
 
 
cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Underwriters Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (A) any the Company, the officers or employees of the Company, or any person controlling the Company, , and (B) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Termination of Agreement
 
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement, any Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement, or (iv) a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General
 
(b) . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 16 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel for NYSE Euronext, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated October 1, 2012 (the Underwriting Agreement) with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule A thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% Notes due 2017 (the Securities).  The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a base indenture, dated as of May 29, 2008 (the Base Indenture), between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended and supplemented by Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 5, 2012 (Supplemental Indenture No. 2), among the Company, the Trustee and Citibank, N.A., as authenticating agent, calculation agent, paying agent, security registrar and transfer agent (the Base Indenture and Supplemental Indenture No. 2 are together referred to herein as the Indenture).
 
We have examined originals or copies of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
We have also participated in the preparation of the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174274) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Incorporated Documents)) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), relating to the registration of securities (the Shelf Securities) to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement), the pricing term sheet dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Pricing Term Sheet) and the prospectus supplement dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Prospectus Supplement), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents.  The registration statement became effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust Indenture Act), upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on May 17, 2011 pursuant to Rule 462(e).  The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the Registration Statement, and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated May 17, 2011 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the Basic Prospectus.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the Pricing Term Sheet are hereinafter referred to as the Disclosure
 
 
Exh A-1
 
 
Package.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the Prospectus.
 
In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have, without independent inquiry or investigation, assumed that (i) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, (ii) all documents submitted to us as copies conform to authentic, complete originals, (iii) all documents filed with or submitted to the Commission through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system (except for required EDGAR formatting changes) conform to the versions of such documents reviewed by us prior to such formatting, (iv) all signatures on all documents that we reviewed are genuine, (v) all natural persons executing documents had and have the legal capacity to do so, (vi) all statements in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company that we reviewed were and are accurate and (vii) all representations made by the Company as to matters of fact in the documents that we reviewed were and are accurate.
 
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
Exh A-2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have considered the statements included in the Disclosure Package under the captions Description of Debt Securities and Description of the Notes, as supplemented by the information set forth in the Pricing Term Sheet, and in the Prospectus under the captions Description of Debt Securities and Description of the Notes insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Securities.  In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.  The statements included in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement under the caption U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences, insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or
 
 
Exh A-3
 
 
legal conclusions with respect thereto and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, in our opinion fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
 
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (2) through (4) above, we have assumed that each party to the Documents has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company). In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, provided that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, except that we express no opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.  For purposes of any Material Agreement stated to be governed by any law other than the law of the State of New York, we have assumed without independent investigation that any such law is the same as the law of the State of New York for all purposes relevant to the opinion in paragraph (6) above.
 
This opinion is rendered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement.  This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel for NYSE Euronext, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated October 1, 2012 (the Underwriting Agreement) with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule A thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% Notes due 2017 (the Securities).  The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of a base indenture, dated as of May 29, 2008, between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended and supplemented by Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of
 
 
Exh A-4
 
 
October 5, 2012, among the Company, the Trustee  and Citibank, N.A., as authenticating agent, calculation agent, paying agent, security registrar and transfer agent.
 
We have also participated in the preparation of the Companys registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-174274) (other than the documents incorporated by reference therein (the Incorporated Documents)) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), relating to the registration of securities (the Shelf Securities) to be issued from time to time by the Company, the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement), the pricing term sheet dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Pricing Term Sheet) and the prospectus supplement dated October 1, 2012 relating to the Securities (the Prospectus Supplement), and have reviewed the Incorporated Documents.  The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the Registration Statement, and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated May 17, 2011 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the Basic Prospectus.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the Pricing Term Sheet are hereinafter referred to as the Disclosure Package.  The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the Prospectus.
 
We have, without independent inquiry or investigation, assumed that all documents filed with or submitted to the Commission through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system (except for required EDGAR formatting changes) conform to the versions of such documents reviewed by us prior to such formatting.
 
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information.  Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States of America and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions Description of Debt Securities, Description of the Notes and U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences).  However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the review of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification.  
 
 
Exh A-5
 
 
We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
 
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1.  In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
 
This letter is delivered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement.  This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the General Counsel of NYSE Euronext (the Company) and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of $850,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2.000% Notes due 2017 (the Notes).  Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the meanings specified in the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below).  This opinion is rendered to you at the request of the Company.  I am providing this opinion in my capacity as General Counsel to the Company, and not in my individual capacity.
 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined:
 
(1)           the Underwriting Agreement, dated October 1, 2012 (the Underwriting Agreement), between the Company and the Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the Underwriters);
 
(2)           the Indenture, dated as of May 29, 2008, and the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 5, 2012 (together, the Indenture), between the Company and Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee (the Trustee);
 
(3)           the form of the Notes;
 
(4)           the General Disclosure Package, Prospectus and Registration Statement;
 
(5)           such records of the Company and such other documents and records, and such matters of law, as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
 
The documents referred to in Items 1 and 2 are collectively referred to as the Subject Documents. I have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Subject Documents and certificates, instruments and other documents delivered in connection therewith or in connection with this opinion for certain factual matters (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, matters of law).  With your consent, I have not independently verified the factual matters contained in such representations or searched any computer or electronic databases or the dockets of any court, administrative body or regulatory or government agency or any other filing office in any jurisdiction in connection with the preparation of this letter.
 
With your approval, I have assumed:
