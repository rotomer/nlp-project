Financial and Operating Highlights

NYSE Euronext (NYX) today reported net income of $108 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to net income of $200 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 include $18 million and $29 million, respectively, of pre-tax merger expenses and exit costs. In the third quarter of 2012, our GAAP effective tax rate included a discrete net deferred tax benefit of approximately $12 million, principally related to the enacted reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25% to 23% in the United Kingdom. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs and discrete tax items, net income in the third quarter of 2012 was $108 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $186 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011.
NEW YORK  November 6, 2012 
"In the third quarter, we continued to execute against our strategy and deliver on our multi-year growth commitments, known as Project 14, which we believe will drive a step-up in the underlying earnings power of the company in the coming years, even if trading volumes remain lackluster," said Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "We are investing in future growth drivers like NYSE Clearing and this quarter we launched new futures contracts based on MSCI global indices and the Russell Europe SMID 300 Index. Additionally, we are moving into adjacencies in the governance and compliance segment with our acquisition of Corpedia. Turning to the efficiency stream of Project 14, we are diligently pulling costs out of the platform with expenses running solidly below prior year levels. Lastly, we are continuing to return capital to our investors through dividends and share repurchases."

for the third quarter of 2012:
 
 
"Our results for the quarter reflect the traction that we are gaining with our efficiency efforts. Against our Project 14 goals, we have taken $82 million out of our expense base year-to-date, which exceeds our 2012 objective of saving 25% of the total $250 million cost reduction plan. This puts us ahead of our full-year 2012 cost guidance," commented Michael S. Geltzeiler, Group Executive Vice President and CFO, NYSE Euronext. "Turning to the capital front, we restructured our investment in Qatar, avoiding $80 million in future payments, we repurchased 16 million shares year-to-date and we refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt at very attractive levels. The latter will result in annual run-rate interest expense savings of approximately $15 million and $24 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively. All of these actions are repositioning the company for an anticipated return to growth."
THIRD QUARTER 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, which include Section 31 fees, liquidity payments and routing and clearing fees (net revenue), were $559 million in the third quarter of 2012, down $145 million, or 21% compared to the third quarter of 2011 and included a $20 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $125 million decrease in net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the third quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower average daily volumes ("ADV"), mostly attributable to the derivatives business. Third quarter of 2011 financial results benefited from extreme market volatility in Europe and the U.S. driven by the European sovereign debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling issue. Market volatility since the third quarter of 2011 has significantly declined, reaching multi-year lows in August of 2012.
Other operating expenses, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, were $388 million in the third quarter of 2012, down $28 million, or 7% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of new business initiatives and a $10 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations, other operating expenses were down $29 million, or 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date on the same basis, other expenses are running $65 million, or 5% below prior year levels.
Year-to-date, Project 14 savings are $82 million, which represents 33% of the total $250 million expected to be saved by the end of 2014, running well above the 25%, or $63 million, expected for the full-year 2012.
Operating income, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $171 million, down $117 million, or 41% compared to the third quarter of 2011 and included a $10 million negative impact attributable to foreign currency fluctuations.
 
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding merger expenses and exit costs, was $235 million, down $125 million, or 35% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42% in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 51% in the third quarter of 2011.
Loss from associates is primarily related to New York Portfolio Clearing. Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest consists primarily of net income attributable to NYSE Amex Options which was partially offset by the net loss attributable to NYSE Liffe U.S.
Based on current projections for profits and changes to UK tax rates, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 24% for the full-year 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, the 21% effective tax rate reflects a tax rate true-up to adjust the year-to-date tax rate to 24% from 25%, which added $0.02 to third quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of 2012 was 247 million, down from 263 million in third quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, a total of 4.7 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $25.46 per share and year-to-date a total of 15.9 million shares have been repurchased at an average price of $26.66. The current repurchase authorization had $128 million remaining as of September 30, 2012.
At September 30, 2012, total debt was $2.5 billion. Cash, cash equivalents and short term financial investments (including $24 million related to Section 31 fees collected from market participants and due to the SEC) were $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2012. The ratio of debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the third quarter of 2012 was 2.4.
On October 5, 2012 NYSE Euronext closed on the public offering of $850 million 2.00% notes due in October 2017. The proceeds from this offering were used to fund the purchase of $336 million of our outstanding $750 million 4.80% notes due in June 2013 and 80 million of our 1 billion 5.375% notes due in June 2015 and for other general corporate purposes, including the reduction in outstanding commercial paper. The refinancing is expected to save an annualized $15 million and $24 million in interest expense in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Total capital expenditures were $41 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $125 million year-to-date.
Headcount as of September 30, 2012 of 3,061 was 16 below year-end 2011 levels despite the addition of 99 employees from the acquisition of Corpedia in June of 2012.
The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. The fourth quarter 2012 dividend is payable on December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 14, 2012. The anticipated ex-date will be December 12, 2012.
THIRD QUARTER 2012 SEGMENT RESULTS
Below is a summary of business segment results:
 
 
 
DERIVATIVES
Derivatives net revenue of $164 million in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $62 million, or 27% compared to the third quarter of 2011 and included a $4 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $58 million decrease in derivatives net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the third quarter of 2011, was driven by lower average daily trading volumes. While market conditions continue to be challenging for derivatives trading, the third quarter of 2012 was a strong quarter for new product development and growth initiatives which will benefit the company in the future:
 
 
 
 
 
 
CASH TRADING AND LISTINGS
Cash Trading and Listings net revenue of $282 million in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $71 million, or 20% compared to the third quarter of 2011 and included an $11 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The $60 million decrease in net revenue, on a constant currency basis, compared to the third quarter of 2011 was primarily driven by lower average daily trading volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
INFORMATION SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Information Services and Technology Solutions revenue was $113 million in the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of $12 million, or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2011 and included a $5 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Net revenue in the third quarter of 2011 included $5 million in onetime sales to the Tokyo and Warsaw Stock Exchanges. The $2 million decrease in revenue, on a constant currency basis, excluding the onetime sales, compared to the third quarter of 2011, was driven by declines in enterprise software and market solutions revenue. The decline in revenue year-over-year is the result of the challenging environment for financial services technology sales which has delayed client decisions on purchases of software and connectivity services. To drive the business forward, NYSE Technologies appointed Jon Robson as its new Chief Executive Officer. Based in New York, he reports to Dominique Cerutti, President & Deputy CEO, NYSE Euronext. Highlights for the third quarter of 2012 included:
