Owens-Illinois Comments on Lower 2003 Outlook Toledo, Ohio, March 28, 2003 -- Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE: OI) today announced that various factors and conditions, principally higher natural gas costs and lower North American glass shipments are having a greater than expected negative impact on the Company's 2003 performance. The Company now believes that earnings for the full year 2003, exclusive of any refinancing charges or other unusual items, will be approximately $1.60 per share, compared to the First Call consensus estimate of $1.78 per share. For the full year 2002, the Company reported a net loss of $3.29 per share which included charges of $3.14 per share for the goodwill accounting change, $2.09 per share (net of dilution) for asbestos-related costs, and $0.07 per share for early extinguishments of debt. Excluding these unusual items, the Company reported net earnings of $2.01 per share (diluted) for the full year 2002. In the event natural gas costs remain above 2002 levels throughout 2003, the Company expects to recover the major portion of such increased natural gas costs through the price adjustment formulas contained in many of its supply agreements with customers, although these adjustments generally will not take effect until the beginning of 2004. Severe winter weather in North America has resulted in lower demand for glass containers, primarily from reduced retail sales and slower inventory restocking by certain of the Company's major customers, thereby making the first quarter of 2003 particularly adversely affected. However, glass shipments are forecast to be stronger in the next several months. Company Profile Owens-Illinois is the largest manufacturer of glass containers in North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand, and one of the largest in Europe. O-I also is a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I include consumer products (blow molded containers, injection molded closures and dispensing systems) and prescription containers.
