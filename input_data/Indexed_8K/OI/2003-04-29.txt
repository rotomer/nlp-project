Exhibit 99.1
        On April 23, 2003, the Company held a conference call with investors and analysts during which its results of operations for the first quarter of 2003 were discussed, including comparisons to results of operations for the first quarter of 2002. The Company presented the following information during that conference call:
Earnings Per Share Comparison
        The factors which account for the net $0.24 reduction in earnings per share from $0.44 per share in the first quarter of 2002 (excluding the unusual items discussed above) to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2003 were as follows:
Consolidated EBIT Comparison
        The factors which account for the net EBIT reduction of $47.1 million from Adjusted EBIT of $204.8 million in the first quarter of 2002 (excluding the asbestos-related charge mentioned above) to EBIT of $157.7 million in the first quarter of 2003 were as follows (millions of dollars):
Plastics Packaging Segment EBIT Comparison
        The factors which account for the EBIT reduction of $23.9 million from EBIT of $74.8 million in the first quarter of 2002 to EBIT of $50.9 million in the first quarter of 2003 were as follows (millions of dollars):
Factors Affecting EBIT of the Glass Containers Segment
        The Company also highlighted several factors which affected EBIT of the Glass Containers Segment. North American glass container operations were unfavorably affected by higher energy costs of $11.2 million and lower unit shipments, led by a decline in beer sales, resulting primarily from severe winter weather conditions. Partially offsetting these effects was an overall improvement in unit pricing of approximately 3% compared to the first quarter of 2002. European glass container operations benefited from an approximate 11% increase in unit shipments, higher prices and improved productivity. Glass container sales improved 25% over the first quarter of 2002 in the Asia Pacific region and EBIT increased approximately 11%, as a result of an increase in unit shipments of over 9% and favorable currency translation rates.
