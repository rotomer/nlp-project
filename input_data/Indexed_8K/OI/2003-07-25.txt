Factors Affecting Glass Containers Segment EBIT
 
The Company also highlighted several factors which affected EBIT of the Glass Containers Segment in the second quarter of 2003 compared to the second quarter of 2002.  North American glass container operations were unfavorably affected by higher energy costs of $12.7 million and lower unit shipments in the U.S. (3.5%) and Canada (5.9%), led by a 4% decline in containers for beer, resulting primarily from cool, wet spring weather conditions.  EBIT from North
American glass container operations was 16% lower than the prior year second quarter.  European glass container operations benefited from an approximate 7% increase in unit shipments, higher prices and improved productivity.  EBIT from European glass container operations was 31.1% higher than the prior year second quarter.  Unit shipments of the Company's South American glass container operations were 6.7% below the second quarter of 2002.  Glass container unit shipments declined 9% from the second quarter of 2002 in the Asia Pacific region.
