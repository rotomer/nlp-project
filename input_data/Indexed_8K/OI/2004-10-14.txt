In the case of Revolving Loans made by Lenders other than Administrative Agent under the immediately preceding sentence, each such Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to Administrative Agent, in Same Day Funds, at the Domestic Funding and Payment Office not later than 1:00 P.M.

On the day such Revolving Loans are made, Administrative Agent's Pro Rata Share of the Domestic Overdraft Amount being refunded shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Administrative Agent and such portion of the Domestic Overdraft Amount deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding.

Revolving Lender to purchase a participation in amounts due with respect to the relevant Offshore Overdraft Account in an amount equal to that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the relevant Offshore Overdraft Amount (calculated in Dollars by reference to the applicable Spot Rate on the date such participation is to be purchased); , , that the obligation of each Revolving Lender to make each such Offshore Revolving Loan or of each Revolving Lender to purchase each such participation in any such Offshore Overdraft Amount is subject to the condition that at the time such extension of credit under the applicable Offshore Overdraft Agreement was made the duly authorized officer of such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider responsible for the administration of such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider's credit relationship with the relevant Offshore Borrower believed in good faith that (a) no Event of Default had occurred and was continuing or (b) any Event of Default that had occurred and was continuing had been waived by Requisite Lenders (or, if applicable under subsection 10.7, all Lenders) at the time such extension of credit under such Offshore Overdraft Agreement was made.  In the case of Offshore Revolving Loans or participation purchases made by Lenders other than Administrative Agent under the immediately preceding sentence, each such Lender shall make the amount of its Offshore Revolving Loan or the amount of its participation, as applicable, available to Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds in Dollars, at the Domestic Funding and Payment Office not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the Business Day next succeeding the date such notice is given and upon such transfer such Offshore Revolving Loans shall be deemed made or such participations purchased, as the case may be.  The proceeds of such Offshore Revolving Loans or participation purchases shall be delivered by Administrative Agent to such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider (and not to the relevant Offshore Borrower) as soon as practicable and applied to repay the relevant Offshore Overdraft Amount.  On the day such Offshore Revolving Loans are made or such participations are purchased, such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider's Pro Rata Share of the Offshore Overdraft Amount being refunded shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of an Offshore Revolving Loan made by such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider and such portion of the Offshore Overdraft Amount deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding.  Each Offshore Borrower authorizes the Offshore Overdraft Account Provider to charge such Offshore Borrower's accounts with such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider the amount of the Offshore Overdraft Amount to be refunded to the extent amounts received from Lenders, including amounts deemed to be received from such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider, are not sufficient to repay in full the Offshore Overdraft Amount to be refunded; that such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider shall give such Offshore Borrower notice of such charges prior thereto or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.  Each Offshore Revolving Loan made in accordance with the foregoing shall be made as a Base Rate Loan.  If any portion of any such amount paid to any Offshore Overdraft Account Provider should be recovered by or on behalf of such Offshore Borrower from such Offshore Overdraft Account Provider in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner contemplated by subsection 10.6.

(ii)           Upon written notice to Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrower may terminate the obligations of Lenders to make or maintain Loans as, and to convert Loans into, Eurodollar Rate Loans and, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall, prior to the time any payment pursuant to subsection 2.6C is required to be made or, if the provisions of subsection 2.6B are applicable, at the end of the then current Interest Period, convert all of the Eurodollar Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans in the manner contemplated by subsection 2.2D but without satisfying the advance notice requirements therein;
 
(iii)          The applicable Borrower may give notice (by telephone and confirmed in writing) to the Affected Lender and Administrative Agent and require the Affected Lender to make the Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested as a Base Rate Loan or to continue to maintain its outstanding Base Rate Loan then the subject of a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation as a Base Rate Loan or to convert its Eurodollar Rate Loans then outstanding that are so affected into Base Rate Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period (or at such earlier time as prepayment is otherwise required to be made pursuant to subsection 2.6C) in the manner contemplated by subsection 2.2D but without satisfying the advance notice requirements therein, that notice to pertain only to the Loans of the Affected Lender and to have no effect on the obligations of the other Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans; or

G.   
Booking of Loans

In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, each holder of Other Lender Guarantied Obligations, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall have no right individually to enforce this Section 9, it being understood and agreed by such holder that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Guarantied Parties in accordance with the terms of this paragraph and that all decisions of the Requisite Lenders shall be binding on such holders.
