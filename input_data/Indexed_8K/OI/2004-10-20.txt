Toledo, Ohio, October 19, 2004 Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE:OI) today reported its third quarter 2004 financial results.
 
Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2004 were $0.42 (diluted) compared with $0.16 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2003.
 
Earnings in the third quarter of 2004 included a reduction in gross profit related to the step-up of BSN finished goods inventory as required by SFAS No. 141, which negatively impacted earnings by $0.12 per share.

Reconciliation of Third Quarter 2003 Earnings to Third Quarter 2004
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $0.52 per share for the third quarter of 2004 compared with $0.43 per share for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $0.09 per share.  Improved pricing in Glass Containers and Plastics Packaging, productivity improvements, and overhead cost reductions, along with BSN operations, accounted for an increase of $0.20 per share over the prior year third quarter.  Increased interest
expense, including the additional interest on borrowing for the BSN acquisition, accounted for a decrease of $0.05 per share.  Items that had an unfavorable effect on the quarterly comparisons were decreased pension income ($0.04 per share) and the write-off of finance fees from voluntary debt prepayments ($0.02 per share).
 
Also, in the third quarter of 2004, the Company reported that cash flows from operating activities rose to $256.8 million compared with $170.6 million in the year ago quarter - an increase of 51%.  Improved operations and significantly improved working capital management were the principal drivers behind this cash flow improvement.  Free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital spending) for the quarter was $147.1 million vs. $75.3 million in the third quarter of 2003.  Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2004 was $183.9 million compared with a negative $173.7 million for the same period a year ago.
 
The strong free cash flow during the first three quarters of 2004 allowed the Company to voluntarily prepay $150 million of term loan debt. Additionally, with the receipt of proceeds following the closing of the blow-molded plastic container divestiture on October 7, the Company paid down an additional $1.2 billion of term loan debt. On October 12, the Company received $82 million cash proceeds from the sale of its 20% equity interest in Consol Limited of South Africa, which were used to further reduce outstanding term loan debt.
 
"We are gratified by our execution against our cash flow priorities, while continuing to demonstrate positive momentum in underlying earnings," said Steve McCracken, Owens-Illinois Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
Business Review
 
Glass Containers Segment
 
Despite market reports of softness in some beer and beverage markets around the world, Segment EBIT in the third quarter of 2004 for the Glass Containers segment grew by $4.1 million or 2.0% from the third quarter a year ago.  Exclusive of the BSN inventory step-up, EBIT grew by $30.8 million, or approximately 15% from a year ago.  Unit shipment declines, increasing energy, raw material and transportation costs, as well as lower pension income were more than offset by improved pricing, currency translation, and operating efficiencies.
 
Plastics Packaging Segment
 
The Plastics Packaging Segment now consists of health care packaging such as prescription containers and medical devices, and closures including tamper-evident caps and dispensing systems. Segment EBIT results for the third quarter of 2004 grew by $5.2 million or 21.4% from the third quarter of 2003.  The improved EBIT results reflect higher unit shipments of both prescription products and closures, and a more favorable price and product sales mix.
 
Cash Flows
 
Higher EBIT, working capital reductions and lower asbestos spending were partially offset by higher cash interest expense and higher capital spending.
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense for continuing operations in the third quarter of 2004 was $120.8 million compared with $105.1 million in the third quarter of 2003.  The higher interest in the 2004 quarter reflects $28.4 million as a result of higher debt related to the BSN acquisition, and $4.6 million for the write-off of finance fees related to a $150 million voluntary prepayment of term loan debt. Partially offsetting this was $17.3 million due to lower interest rates resulting from the December 2003 repricing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, along with interest savings resulting from the Company's fixed-to-floating interest rate swap program on a portion of its fixed-rate debt.
 
Capital Spending
 
Capital spending for continuing operations for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $99.2 million, an increase of $23.7 million from the year ago quarter. The higher capital spending in the quarter was the result of BSN and the new Windsor, Colo., glass container plant. Combined, these two items totaled approximately $44 million, or approximately 44% of the capital spending in the quarter.  Reduction of base capital spending through enhanced capital efficiency was identified as one of the Company's key liquidity improvement initiatives in 2003 and will remain so going forward.
 
Nine-Month Results  
 
Segment EBIT from Continuing Operations for the nine months ending September 2004 increased by $62.6 million or 11.9%. Exclusive of the BSN inventory step-up, Segment EBIT grew by $93.0 million or approximately 18% from the year ago period.  Higher unit shipments for both the Company's glass and plastics businesses, coupled with better prices and operating efficiencies, were only partially offset by higher energy and transportation costs and lower pension income.
 
Consolidated Debt
 
Consolidated debt at September 30, 2004, was $6.587 billion, compared with $5.502 billion at September 30, 2003.  The acquisition of BSN Glasspack on June 21, 2004, increased debt by $1.360 billion.  The Company's cash balance at September 30, 2004, was $262.1 million compared with $148.3 million at September 30, 2003.
 
The Company's free cash flow generation for the first three quarters of 2004 was $183.9 million compared with a negative $173.7 million for the same period a year ago.
 
With the receipt of proceeds following the closing of the blow-molded plastic container divestiture on October 7, the Company paid down an additional $1.2 billion of term loan debt. On October 12, the Company received $82 million cash proceeds from the sale of its 20% equity interest in Consol Limited of South Africa, which were used to further reduce outstanding term loan debt.
 
Asbestos
 
 
Asbestos-related cash payments in the third quarter of 2004 were $54.4 million, compared with $57.3 million for the third quarter of 2003.  For the nine months ended September 2004, asbestos-related payments of $150.3 million compare with payments of $157.2 million for the nine months ended September 2003.  New claim filings in the third quarter of 2004 were down approximately 37% from the same period a year ago, continuing their downward trend. For the nine-month period ended September 2004, new filings have declined approximately 50% from the nine-month period ending September 2003. As of September 30, 2004, the number of asbestos-related lawsuits and claims pending against the Company was approximately 35,000, up from approximately 29,000 pending claims at December 31, 2003, due to a lower rate of claim disposition than in the comparable earlier period.  Additionally, the Company believes that a significant number of those pending cases have exposure dates after the Company's 1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums.  The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligation on a short-term and long-term basis.  The Company expects to conduct its annual comprehensive review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for the full year 2004.
 
Outlook
 
The Company expects continued positive cash flows and growing underlying EBIT.  EBIT pressures related to increasing costs for transportation, raw materials, energy and product substitutions versus plastic should be more than offset by European acquisition synergies, global initiatives in procurement, improved capital efficiency, product substitutions versus alternatives and industry consolidation.
 
McCracken further commented that "With the execution of the blow-molded plastic container sale and our voluntary prepayment of bank debt, our turnaround and transformation agenda passed some important milestones.  However, we know that we must continue to execute against our primary priorities and core strategies to ensure positive cash flows and continuous earnings improvements moving forward."

(a)
          
 
EBIT consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority share owners' interests in earnings of subsidiaries.  Segment EBIT excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
(b)
          
 
The Company presents EBIT because management believes that it provides investors with a measure of operating performance without regard to level of indebtedness or other related costs of capital.  The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBIT is net earnings.  The Company presents Segment EBIT because management uses the measure, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.
 
A reconciliation of segment and consolidated EBIT to earnings from continuing operations is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
 
 
Amount for 2003 excludes a charge of $28.5 million for the permanent closure of the Hayward, California glass container factory.
