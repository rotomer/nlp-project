Agreements
 
(a)  The Company agrees with the Underwriter that:
 
(i)   The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof, to become effective.  Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus) to the Base Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object.  Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to
Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto, to be filed in a form you reasonably approve with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed.  The Company will promptly advise the Underwriter (A) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, shall have become effective, (B) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (C) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (D) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (E) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (F) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
 
(ii)   If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company will (A) promptly notify the Underwriter of any such event, (B) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (C) thereafter promptly supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
(iii)   As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriter an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
 
(iv)   The Company will furnish to the Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriter, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of the Final
Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Underwriter may reasonably request.  The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
 
(v) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
(vi) The Company will comply with all applicable securities and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and use its best efforts to cause the Company's directors and officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
 
(vii)   The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
 
(b)  The Selling Stockholder agrees with the Underwriter that such Selling Stockholder will advise you promptly, and if requested by you, will confirm such advice in writing from the Execution Time until delivery of a prospectus relating to the Securities by an underwriter or dealer is no longer required under the Act, of any change in information in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus relating to such Selling Stockholder that was furnished by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus.
 
6.    The obligations of the Underwriter to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Selling Stockholder contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company and the Selling Stockholder made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company and the Selling Stockholder of their respective obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriter.
 
(a)  If the Registration Statement has not become effective prior to the Execution Time, unless the Underwriter agrees in writing to a later time, the Registration Statement will become effective not later than (i) 6:00 PM New York City time on the date of determination of the public offering price, if such determination occurred at or prior to 3:00 PM New York City time on such date or (ii) 9:30 AM on the Business Day

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

Indemnification and Contribution.
provided
however
 
(b)  The Selling Stockholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, the Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriter and each person who controls the Company or the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with respect to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  The Company and the Underwriter acknowledge that the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity is the following:  (i) the first sentence in the second paragraph under the caption "Selling Stockholder" in the Final Prospectus concerning the address of the selling stockholder entity, and (ii) the tabular and footnote information under the caption "Selling Stockholder" in the Base Prospectus and in the Final Prospectus concerning the name of selling stockholder entity, the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such entity, the number of shares of Common Stock such entity is offering, and the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such entity after the sale.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have.
(c)  The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and the Selling Stockholder and each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to the Underwriter, but only with respect to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have.  The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting" (A) the sentence related to concessions and (B) the paragraphs related to stabilization, short sales and covering transactions in the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriter for inclusion in the Final Prospectus.
 
(d)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (W) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (X) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (W) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (X) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (Y) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (Z) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
provided
however
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent.
 
(e)  In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, by the Selling Stockholder and by the Underwriter from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by the Underwriter hereunder.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, of the Selling Stockholder and of the Underwriter in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company and by the Selling Stockholder shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by each of them, and benefits received by the Underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, the Selling Stockholder on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, (i) each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, (ii) each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and (iii) each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Selling Stockholder, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
provided
however
(f)  The liability of the Selling Stockholder under such Selling Stockholder's representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Securities to the Underwriter.  The Company and the Selling Stockholder may agree, as among themselves and without limiting the rights of the Underwriter under this Agreement, as to the respective amounts of such liability for which they each shall be responsible.
 
9.  [Intentionally Omitted.]
 
10.    This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriter, by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authoritiesor (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is material and adverse and is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriter impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination.
 
11.    The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers, of the Selling Stockholder or its authorized persons, and of the Underwriter, set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company, or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancelation of this Agreement.
