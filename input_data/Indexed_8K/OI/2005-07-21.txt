"We are pleased with our continued earnings progress, despite some difficult conditions during the quarter.  European synergies, unit volume growth, improved pricing and productivity overcame inflationary pressures and several localized operational issues to provide positive earnings growth.  While second quarter cash flow was impacted by quarter-specific expenditures, cash generation for debt reduction remains our primary focus and we expect positive progress during the remainder of the year," said Steve McCracken, O-I Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
Reconciliation of Second Quarter 2004 earnings to Second Quarter 2005
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2005 compared with $0.43 per share for the second quarter of 2004.  Included in the 2005 results were favorable adjustments of depreciation and
 
amortization in connection with finalizing the fair values of the BSN Glasspack assets acquired in June 2004.  The difference between the estimated amounts recorded in 2004 and the final amounts related to 2004 accounted for a benefit of $0.04 per share in the second quarter.  Second quarter earnings also include an additional tax charge of $0.05 to reduce net operating loss benefits in Ohio, where the corporate income tax is being phased out and replaced with a gross receipts tax. Exclusive of these items, the Company earned $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2005 compared with $0.43 per share in the 2004 quarter, excluding unusual items in both periods.
 
During the second quarter of 2005, the principal earnings drivers were the positive impact of the BSN acquisition, higher unit shipments, productivity improvements and cost reductions, improved pricing, and a more favorable product sales mix.  These factors accounted for an increase of $0.26 per share.  Additionally, currency translation rates resulted in an increase of $0.02 per share.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher energy costs, which reduced earnings per share by $0.06.  All other cost inflation items, excluding energy, decreased earnings by another $0.06 per share.  Earnings in the second quarter of 2005 were also lower by $0.01 per share as a result of divestitures of the Company's 20% interest in Consol Limited in October 2004 and a glass plant in Corsico, Italy, in January 2005.  The combination of all other items accounted for a decrease of $0.01 per share.
 
Business Review
 
Glass Containers Segment
Segment Operating Profit in the second quarter of 2005 for the Glass Containers segment grew by $56.7 million, or 30.0%, from the second quarter of 2004.  Contributing to this quarter-over-quarter increase was the incremental benefit of the BSN acquisition coupled with higher unit shipments, improved pricing, product sales mix and productivity, and favorable currency translation.  Shipments of champagne and wine containers were particularly strong across all regions.  Partially offsetting these positive factors were weaker beer container shipments, as well as increasing energy, raw material, and transportation costs.
 
Plastics Packaging Segment
Following the October 2004 divestiture of the blow-molded plastic container business, the Plastics Packaging Segment now consists of healthcare packaging, including prescription containers and medical devices, and closures, which includes tamper-evident caps and dispensing systems.  Segment Operating Profit for the second quarter of 2005 was $33.8 million, level with $33.8 million in the second quarter of 2004.  Stronger results for the healthcare and closures businesses were offset by the absence of $4.1 million in operating profits from the Australian plastics business which was partially divested in June 2004.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $116.6 million versus $102.7 million for the second quarter of 2004.  The interest expense for the second quarter of 2004 represents continuing operations only, as the interest expense related to the debt for the divested
 
blow-molded plastic container business has been reclassified to discontinued operations.
 
The higher interest expense in the second quarter of 2005 includes approximately $10.3 million for higher debt primarily related to the BSN acquisition, partially offset by voluntary prepayments of debt in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.  In addition, higher interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt increased interest expense by approximately $4.5 million during the quarter versus the prior year quarter.  Partially offsetting these increases was $0.9 million lower amortization of deferred finance fees.
 
Capital Spending
Capital spending for continuing operations for the second quarter of 2005 totaled $109.2 million, compared with $93.4 million for the year ago quarter.  For the six months ended June 2005, capital spending of $185.5 million compared with $169.3 million for the six months ended June 2004.
 
The combination of the new glass plant in Windsor, Colo., and spending related to the acquired BSN operations for the second quarter and first half 2005 amounted to approximately $37 million and $65 million, respectively.
 
Consolidated Debt and Cash Flows
 
Consolidated debt at June 30, 2005, was $5.381 billion, compared with $5.255 billion at March 31, 2005.  Cash and short-term investments ended the second quarter at $211.8 million compared with $228.3 million at the end of the first quarter.  The combination of the change in debt and the change in cash represents an approximate $143 million increase in net debt.  More than accounting for this net debt increase in the second quarter was $293.5 million of cash outflows related to the following items: 1) $65 million for the settlement of two foreign cross currency swaps; 2) $39 million to Graham Packaging as a post-closing purchase price adjustment based largely on changes in certain working capital components of the divested plastic business; 3) $28 million related to European integration and restructuring; and 4) higher cash interest in the second quarter of $161.5 million, $94 million higher than the first quarter 2005, principally due to semi-annual interest payments on the Company's fixed rate public debt.  These second quarter payments approximate slightly more than one-third of the Company's annual cash interest payments.
 
Asbestos
 
Asbestos-related cash payments in the second quarter of 2005 were $40.8 million compared with $45.5 million for the second quarter of 2004, a reduction of $4.7 million, or 10.4%.  New claim filings in the first half of 2005 were approximately 5,300, down approximately 29% from the first half of 2004.  As of June 30, 2005, the number of asbestos-related lawsuits and claims pending against the Company was approximately 33,000, compared with 35,000 at December 31, 2004.  The Company believes that a significant number of these pending cases have exposure dates after the Company's 1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums.  The
 
Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligations on a short-term and long-term basis.
 
Six-Month Results
 
For the first six months of 2005, the Company reported earnings from continuing operations of $203.7 million, or $1.26 per share (diluted) compared with $137.4 million, or $0.81 per share, for the first six months of 2004.  Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $1.00 per share for the first half of 2005, compared with $0.67 per share for the 2004 period.  Results for the first half of 2005 include the favorable second quarter depreciation and amortization adjustments of $0.04 per share and the additional tax charge of $0.05 per share discussed above.  Also included are favorable adjustments of $0.04 per share from a reduction of the Company's accruals for self-insured risks and $0.03 per share from a reduction of the tax provision primarily to recognize changes in deferred taxes at several international subsidiaries, both recognized in the first quarter of 2005.  Exclusive of these items, the Company earned $0.94 per share in the first half of 2005, compared with $0.71 per share in the first half of 2004.
 
Effective Tax Rate
 
Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both years presented in Note (1), the Company's effective tax rate for the first six months of 2005 was 29.2% compared with 27.4% in the first six months of 2004, and 26.9% for the full year 2004.  The higher 2005 effective tax rate is principally due to a change in the mix of earnings toward higher tax international jurisdictions, the recent tax legislation in Ohio and recognition of other discrete changes in deferred taxes during the first half of 2005.  The Company expects its full year 2005 effective tax rate, exclusive of separately taxed items and discrete adjustments, to be approximately 29%.
 
Outlook
 
Although we hit a few bumps in the road during the second quarter, our financial turnaround and business transformation remain on track as we continue to focus on our core priorities and primary strategiesWe remain confident in our ability to deliver solid earnings and cash flows from operations for the remainder of the year, despite inflationary pressures and the negative cash impacts of financing and European integration.  Our European leadership team is now firmly in place and our global supply chain and procurement initiatives are underway with positive momentum," said McCracken.

Note (1)
 
 
 
* During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed the documentation and re-designation of its natural gas hedge contracts and began to apply special hedge accounting as of April 1, 2005.  Fluctuations in the unrealized value of natural gas hedge contracts during 2004 and during the first quarter of 2005 were reported in results of operations as non-cash gains.  After April 1, 2005, fluctuations in unrealized value will be reported as changes in the Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners' equity.
 
Therefore, the $33.3 million aggregate mark to market value of the contracts recorded as gains during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 will result in reported energy costs that are in excess of net cash costs during the remaining terms of contracts that existed at April 1, 2005.  The amount of such excess during the second quarter of 2005 was $7.0 million.  The excess will be $17.5 million in the second half of 2005 and $8.8 million during 2006. Both the gains and the excess costs are excluded from Segment Operating Profit.
