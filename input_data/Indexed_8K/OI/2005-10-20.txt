Exhibit 99.1
 
O-I Reports Third Quarter Results: Strong cash flow enabled continued debt reduction.
 
Toledo, Ohio, October 19, 2005  Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE:OI) today reported its third quarter 2005 financial results.
 
 
 
Debt was reduced $178.9 million during the quarter
 -           
 
Free cash flow from continuing operations (cash provided by continuing operating activities minus additions to PP&E) increased to $190.8 million in the quarter, up $57.3 million from the year ago quarter
 -           
 
Working capital provided $166.7 million in cash during the quarter, compared with $121.1 million in the year ago quarter
 -           
 
Unit shipments during the quarter were higher than the prior year: Glass Containers up 3%; Plastics Packaging up 20%
 -           
 
Asbestos cash payments this quarter declined by 10% versus the prior year; new filings in the quarter were 48% below the prior year
 -           
 
"Cash generation for debt reduction, our top priority, was excellent this quarter.  Operational earnings declines due to cost impacts of energy, raw materials, transportation and transformation initiatives are significant and will likely cause full year 2005 EPS to fall below the 2004 level of $1.43; however, we understand these impacts and believe they are actionable.  We remain on track in our turnaround and transformation, and believe our third quarter results are a symbol of our focus on deleveraging as our core priority," said Steve McCracken, O-I Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Reconciliation of Third Quarter 2004 earnings to Third Quarter 2005
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2005 compared with $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2004.
 
Earnings during the third quarter of 2005 were positively impacted by higher unit shipments, improved selling prices, productivity and cost reduction initiatives, and European operational synergies. However, these positive factors were more than offset by unprecedented inflationary cost pressures, principally energy and transportation, as well as operational inefficiencies, European integration and the new European headquarters, as discussed in the Company's September 15 press release.
th
 
The higher unit shipments in the quarter reflected stronger demand for beer and beverage containers in the Company's glass business, and significant growth in health care containers and tamper evident closures in the plastics business.
 
The major factors contributing to the net $0.06 EPS decline in the third quarter of 2005 compared with the third quarter of 2004 were as follows:
 
 
Consolidated Debt and Cash Flows
 
Consolidated debt at September 30, 2005 was $5.202 billion, $178.9 million lower than the $5.381 billion at June 30, 2005.  Cash and short-term investments ended the third quarter at $222.0 million compared with $211.8 million at the end of the second quarter, an increase of $10.2 million.  The combination of the change in debt and the change in cash represents a $189.1 million decrease in net debt during the quarter.
The principal drivers behind this reduction in net debt were as follows:
 
 
Additionally, consolidated debt at September 30, 2005, was approximately $1.4 billion lower compared with September 30, 2004.  This debt reduction is principally due to the application of proceeds from the divestiture of the Company's blow-molded plastic containers business in October 2004 and other cash generation that was used for debt reduction.
 
Business Review
 
- Volume Growth Offset by Cost Pressures
Glass Containers Segment
 
Segment Operating Profit in the third quarter of 2005 for the Glass Containers segment declined by $12.5 million, or 6.0%, from the third quarter of 2004. The principal factors contributing to that $12.5 million decline were as follows:
 
 
- Significant Volume and Earnings Growth
Plastics Packaging Segment
 
Segment Operating Profit for the third quarter of 2005 was $33.1 million, compared with $29.5 million in the third quarter of 2004.
Higher unit sales volumes, improved manufacturing performance, and good cost control were the principal drivers to the higher operating profit results.
The principal factors contributing to the $3.6 million increase in third quarter Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging Segment compared to the year ago quarter were as follows:
 
 
Following the October 2004 divestiture of the blow-molded plastic container business, the Plastics Packaging Segment now consists of healthcare packaging, including prescription containers and medical devices, and closures, which includes tamper-evident caps and dispensing systems.
 
Capital Spending
Capital spending for continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $111.1 million, compared with $99.2 million for the year ago quarter.
 
In the third quarter of 2005 capital spending for the new glass plant in Windsor, Colo., was approximately $12 million higher than the prior year quarter.  For the first nine months of 2005, spending related to Windsor and the acquired BSN operations was approximately $81 million higher than the first nine months of 2004.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the third quarter of 2005 was $113.3 million versus $120.8 million for the third quarter of 2004. The interest expense for the third quarter of 2004 represents continuing operations only, as the interest expense related to the debt for the divested blow-molded plastic container business has been reclassified to discontinued operations.
 
The $7.5 million of lower interest expense in the third quarter of 2005 versus the third quarter of 2004 can be summarized as follows:
 
Effective Tax Rate
Excluding the effects of separately taxed items in both years presented in Note (1), the Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2005 was 30.0% compared with 27.9% in the first nine months of 2004, and 26.9% for the full year 2004.  The higher 2005 effective tax rate is principally due to a change in the mix of earnings toward higher tax international jurisdictions, the recent tax legislation in Ohio and recognition of other discrete changes in deferred taxes during the first nine months of 2005. The Company expects its full year 2005 effective tax rate, exclusive of separately taxed items, to be approximately 30%.
 
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2005 consists principally of a third quarter benefit from the reversal of an accrual for potential tax liabilities related to a previous divestiture.  The accrual is no longer required based on the Company's reassessment of the potential liabilities.
 
Asbestos
 
Asbestos-related cash payments in the third quarter of 2005 were $48.9 million compared with $54.4 million for the third quarter of 2004, a reduction of $5.5 million, or 10.1%.  As of September 30, 2005, the number of asbestos-related lawsuits and claims was approximately 33,000, compared with approximately 35,000 at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that a significant number of these pending cases have exposure dates after the Company's 1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligations on a short-term and long-term basis.
 
Outlook
 
"The significant cost impacts to our business are understood and actionable.  Impacts to cash flow from inflationary cost pressures must be offset via pricing and major initiatives in procurement, productivity, capital deployment and supply chain.  We remain on course and expect a challenging but positive 2006," said McCracken.
 
Note (1)
 
 
* During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed the documentation and re-designation of its natural gas hedge contracts and began to apply special hedge accounting as of April 1, 2005.  Fluctuations in the unrealized value of natural gas hedge contracts during 2004 and during the first quarter of 2005 were reported in results of operations as non-cash gains.  After April 1, 2005, fluctuations in unrealized value will be reported as changes in the Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners' equity.  Therefore, the $33.3 million aggregate mark to market value of the contracts recorded as gains during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 will result in reported energy costs that are in excess of net cash costs during the remaining terms of contracts that existed at April 1, 2005.  The amount of such excess during the third quarter of 2005 was $8.2 million.  The excess will be $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $8.8 million during 2006. Both the gains and the excess costs are excluded from Segment Operating Profit.
