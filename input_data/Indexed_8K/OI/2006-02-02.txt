Exhibit 99.1
 
O-I Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results: Strong Fourth Quarter and Full Year Cash Flow Enable Continued Debt Reduction.
 
Toledo, Ohio, February 1, 2006
 Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE:OI) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2005 financial results.
 
"We are delighted with our ability to generate significant cash flow and reduce debt in the fourth quarter and full year.  However, continued inflationary pressures have negatively impacted our underlying earnings.  In addition, earnings were impacted by our decision to temporarily idle production in certain areas to balance fourth quarter supply with demand, consistent with the Company's plan to operate with lower inventories going forward.  Furthermore, we recorded three large non-cash charges during the quarter related to our Critical Accounting Estimates.  That said, the excellent cash result is testimony that we are making strides in our culture shift to focus on cash performance," said Steve McCracken, O-I Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
   Fourth quarter results included:
 
   Net loss of $5.86 per share vs. $0.11 net income per share (diluted)in 2004
  Net loss from continuing operations of $5.86 per share vs. a net loss of $0.25 per share in 2004
   Earnings from continuing operations, exclusive of the unusual items listed in Note (1), were $0.03 per share vs. $0.24 per share in 2004
 
 
   
Non-cash charges totaling $935.6 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 to reflect: 1) a $135.0 million ($86.0 million after tax) increase to the asbestos reserve, 2) a $494.0 million goodwill impairment in the Company's Asia Pacific Glass business unit and 3) a $306.6 million valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.
 
   Free cash flow from continuing operations (cash provided by continuing operating activities minus additions to PP&E) was $146.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $151.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2004. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $99.7 million versus $108.0 million for the full year 2004.
 
   Management working capital (accounts receivable, plus inventory, plus repair parts, less trade accounts payable), at December 31,
2005 was 18.0% of net sales, the lowest since the 1998 high of 27.0%.
 
   Full year 2005 capital spending of $404.1 million was 84.2% of depreciation  both the total capital spending and the percentage of depreciation were the Company's lowest since 1998.
 
  Asbestos cash payments for the full year 2005 were $171.1 million, the lowest level since 1999.  New filings for the year were 40% lower than the full year 2004.
 
   Net debt was reduced by $248.2 million in 2005 to the lowest level since 1998.
 
(a) Off balance sheet prior to December 2005, see discussion below.
 
 
Consolidated Debt and Cash Flows
 
The principal drivers behind the fourth quarter and full year reductions in net debt were as follows:
 
 
The Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined in the Company's Senior Secured Credit Agreement) at December 31, 2005 was 3.82 to 1.00, compared with 4.13 to 1.00 at December 31, 2004.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, as disclosed during the Company's November 15, 2005 Investor Day event, the Company expanded the capacity of its European accounts receivable securitization program from 200 million to 320 million to include operations in Italy and the United Kingdom. The accounts receivable securitization program provides lower costs of financing than traditional bank debt. The terms of this expansion resulted in a change in accounting for the program from off-balance sheet to on-balance sheet. The net impact was an increase, at December 31, 2005, in reported accounts receivable and consolidated debt of $191.8 million, respectively.
 
 
Reconciliation of Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings to Fourth Quarter 2005
 
Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $0.03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared with $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004.
The major factors contributing to the net $0.21 EPS decline were as follows:
 
 
Business Review
 
Glass Containers Segment
 Improved Selling Prices and Volume Growth Offset by Cost Pressures and Selective Idling of Capacity to Reduce Inventories
 
Segment Operating Profit of $144.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 for the Glass Containers segment declined by $50.2 million, or 25.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2004. The principal factors contributing to the decline were as follows:
 
Plastics Packaging Segment
 Partial Exit of Australian Plastics Business, Higher Selling Prices and Strong Volume Drove Earnings Growth
 
Segment Operating Profit for the fourth quarter of 2005 for the Plastics Packaging segment was $29.4 million, compared with $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in the fourth quarter 2005 Segment Operating Profit were gains totaling approximately $6 million from the sale of one plant related to the partial exit from the Australian plastics business and a reduction of the accrued exit costs. On a full-year basis, net gains related to the partial exit of the Australian plastics business amounted to less than $4 million.
 
Higher selling prices and higher unit sales volumes offset inflationary cost increases and the negative impact of selective idling of production to balance capacity with demand.
 
The principal factors contributing to the $9.7 million increase in fourth quarter Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging segment compared to the year ago quarter were as follows:
 
 
Capital Spending
Capital spending for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $107.5 million, compared with $168.2 million for the year ago quarter.  Capital spending for continuing operations for the full year 2005 totaled $404.1 million compared with $436.7 million in 2004.
 
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $118.3 million versus $150.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Included in interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $30.8 million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to early extinguishment of debt with the proceeds from the blow-molded plastic container divestiture, as well as repurchase premiums related to the November 2004 refinancing of several debt obligations.  Excluding these refinancing charges, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $119.7 million.
 
A reconciliation of interest expense for the fourth quarter 2004 to the fourth quarter 2005 is as follows:
 
 
Effective Tax Rate
Excluding the pretax and tax amounts of the items presented in Note 1, the Company's effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 was 28.4%, compared with 23.4% for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Excluding the pretax and tax amounts of the items presented in Note 2, the Company's effective tax rate for the full year 2005 was 29.9% compared with 26.9% for the full year 2004.  The higher 2005 effective tax rate is principally due to a change in the mix of earnings toward higher tax international jurisdictions, the recent tax legislation in Ohio and recognition of other discrete changes in deferred taxes during 2005.
 
 
Asbestos
 
Asbestos-related cash payments in the fourth quarter of 2005 were $35.9 million compared with $39.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, a reduction of $3.9 million, or 9.8%.  New filings during the quarter were 56% lower than the prior year quarter. As of December 31, 2005, the number of pending asbestos-related lawsuits and claims was approximately 32,000, compared with approximately 35,000 at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that a significant number of these cases have exposure dates after the Company's 1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligations on a short-term and long-term basis. Deferred amounts payable totaled approximately $91 million at December 31, 2005, virtually unchanged from the amount at December 31, 2004. Asbestos cash payments for the full year 2005 were $171.1 million compared with $190.1 million for the full year 2004, representing a reduction of $19.0 million or 10.0%.
 
 
Full Year 2005 Results
 
The Company's full year 2005 financial results, compared with the 2004 financial results were as follows:
 
Outlook
Price Increases, Productivity, and Execution of Strategic Initiatives Expected to Counter 2006 Inflationary Cost Pressures
 
"We continue to believe that we have effective strategies in place to counter what we expect to be significant inflationary cost pressures in 2006.  Although we expect prices will increase meaningfully in 2006,  we must also successfully execute against our core priorities: European integration, procurement, supply chain, cash flow and debt reduction, combined with modest revenue growth.  As shown by our successful cash performance in 2005, we will continue to have a bias toward cash.  We believe that we are on track in our transformation agenda and look forward to updating investors on our progress in the year ahead," said McCracken.
 
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
 
The Company recorded three non-cash charges in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to Critical Accounting Estimates disclosed in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and Forms 10-Q for the first three quarterly reporting periods in 2005.
 
Asbestos
The Company conducted its annual comprehensive review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for the full year 2005. As a result of that review, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $135.0 million to increase the accrual for future asbestos-related costs.  In 2004, the Company increased its accrual for future asbestos-related costs by $152.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, the Company's accrual for future asbestos-related costs is $730.1 million of which $158.0 million is classified as a current liability.
 
Goodwill
As required by FAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles," the Company evaluates goodwill annually for impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill using business enterprise values.  As a result of that review, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $494.0 million to write down a portion of the goodwill in its Asia Pacific Glass business unit. The primary reason for the decline in business enterprise value is lower
projected cash flows caused by competitive pricing pressures in the Company's Australian glass operations.
 
Deferred Tax Assets
In accordance with FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $306.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to increase the valuation allowance against its accumulated net deferred tax assets in the United States.  The Company had recorded net deferred tax assets related principally to asbestos charges and net operating losses in recent years.  The amount of valuation allowance required under the provisions of FAS No. 109 is dependent upon projected near-term U.S. profitability including the effects of tax planning.  During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company determined that an additional valuation allowance was necessary because of the near-term effects on U.S. profitability of continued asbestos-related payments, significant interest expense, rising energy costs and other cost increases.
 
As a result of not being able to provide a tax benefit on its U.S. losses, the Company expects that its global effective tax rate will be in the range of 38% to 40% for 2006.  The Company believes that its global cash tax payments in 2006 should remain within prior year levels of $125 million to $135 million.
 
Note (1)
Note (2)
*  During the first quarter of 2005, the Company completed the documentation and re-designation of its natural gas hedge contracts and began to apply special hedge accounting as of April 1, 2005.  Fluctuations in the unrealized value of natural gas hedge contracts during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 were reported in results of operations as non-cash gains.  After April 1, 2005, fluctuations in unrealized value will be reported as changes in the Other Comprehensive
Income component of share owners' equity.  Therefore, the $33.3 million aggregate mark to market value of the contracts recorded as gains during 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 will result in reported energy costs that are in excess of net cash costs during the remaining terms of contracts that existed at April 1, 2005.

Segment Operating Profit excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
 
                            
The Company presents Operating Profit because management believes that it provides investors with a measure of operating performance without regard to level of indebtedness or other related costs of capital.  The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Operating Profit is net earnings (continuing operations).  The Company presents Segment Operating Profit because management uses the measure, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.
