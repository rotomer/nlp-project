O-I Reports First Quarter Results: Execution against core priorities counters inflationary headwinds.
 
Toledo, Ohio, April 26, 2006 - Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE:OI) today reported its first quarter 2006 financial results.
 
"While the first quarter was an extremely difficult comparison to prior year, we are pleased by our executional momentum against our core priorities. Despite unprecedented inflationary cost pressures of nearly $100 million in the quarter and unfavorable currency translation, we were able to offset a significant portion of these through revenue increases and productivity improvements. In addition, we were able to  balance  cash flow performance through  our continuing focus on working capital and capital expenditures," said Steve McCracken, O-I Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
First quarter highlights:
 
 Net earnings of $0.12 per share (diluted) vs. $0.73 per share (diluted) in 2005.
 
Net earnings, exclusive of the unusual items listed in Note (1), were $0.14 per share vs. $0.44 per share in 2005
 
 
In addition to the items presented in Note (1), the 2005 results also included favorable adjustments of $0.04 per share from a $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax) reduction of the Company's accruals for self-insured risks and $0.03 per share from a $5.3 million reduction of the tax provision primarily to recognize changes in deferred taxes at several international subsidiaries. Exclusive of these items, the Company earned $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2005.
     
 
Free cash flow (cash utilized in operating activities plus additions to PP&E) was a use of $205.0 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared with a use of $206.6 million in the first quarter of 2005.
     
 
Management working capital (accounts receivable, plus inventory and repair parts, less accounts payable) at March 31, 2006 was 20.5% of net sales for the twelve months then ended, compared with 24.3% at March 31, 2005. Despite the Company's normal seasonal increase in working capital, management's working capital reduction programs drove the year-over-year improvement.
     
 
Capital spending in the first quarter of 2006 was $53.4 million or 46.0% of depreciation, compared with $76.3 million, or 59.0% of depreciation for the first quarter of 2005.
     
Asbestos-related cash payments for the first quarter of 2006 were $41.0 million compared with $45.5 million in the first quarter of 2005. New claim filings for the first quarter were 44.0% lower than the first quarter 2005.
     
 
European SAP implementation remains on schedule with the successful "go live" start-ups in three countries at quarter end.
     
 
Reconciliation of First Quarter 2006 Earnings to First Quarter 2005
 
Earnings per share, excluding the items listed in Note (1) were $0.14 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2006 compared with $0.37 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2005. The major factors contributing to the net $0.23 EPS decline were as follows:
 
 
Consolidated Net Debt and Free Cash Flow
 
Consolidated net debt at March 31, 2006 was $5,204.7 million, compared with $4,998.5 million at December 31, 2005. The increase of $206.2 million principally reflects the normal seasonal first quarter increase in working capital and the cash impact of inflationary cost pressures, as previously communicated.
 
 
The principal factors behind the first quarter 2006 increase in net debt, compared with the decrease during first quarter 2005 were the non-recurrence of $180.5 million in divestiture proceeds and unfavorable debt-related hedging activity this year.
 
Business Review
 
 Increased selling prices, improved productivity, and higher unit shipments partially offset inflationary cost impacts.
Glass Containers Segment
 
Segment Operating Profit of $166.2 million in the first quarter of 2006 for the Glass Containers Segment was $36.1 million,  17.8% lower than the Segment Operating Profit for first quarter of 2005 of $202.3 million. The principal factors contributing to this decline were as follows:
 
 
 Higher production volumes and improved manufacturing efficiencies offset inflationary cost increases and the winding down of the Australian plastics business.
Plastics Packaging Segment
 
Segment Operating Profit for the first quarter of 2006 for the Plastics Packaging Segment was $31.7 million, compared with $30.9 million in the first quarter of 2005.
 
The principal factors contributing to the $0.8 million, or 3%, increase in first quarter Operating Profit for the Plastics Packaging Segment compared with the year ago quarter were as follows:
 
Capital Spending
Capital spending for the first quarter of 2006 totaled $53.4 million, compared with $76.3 million for the year ago quarter.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the first quarter of 2006 was $119.4 million versus $118.5 million in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Effective Tax Rate
Excluding the items presented in Note 1, the Company's effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2006 was 39.0%, compared with 24.0% for the first quarter of 2005. The rate for 2005 was reduced by approximately 6% for discrete items in the quarter as noted above. The 2006 rate is higher principally because the Company is not recording tax benefits on its losses in the United States.
 
Cash tax payments for the first quarter of 2006 amounted to $23.3 million compared with $35.8 million for the first quarter of 2005.
 
Asbestos
 
Asbestos-related cash payments in the first quarter of 2006 were $41.0 million compared with $45.5 million in the first quarter of 2005. New filings during the quarter were 44% lower than the prior year quarter. As of March 31, 2006, the number of pending asbestos-related lawsuits and claims was approximately 30,000, compared with approximately 32,000 at December 31, 2005. The Company believes that a significant number of these cases have exposure dates after the Company's 1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligations on a short-term and long-term basis. Deferred amounts payable of approximately $91 million at March 31, 2006, were unchanged from December 31, 2005.
 
Outlook
 
The Company continues to believe that it has effective strategies in place to counter expected significant inflationary cost pressures throughout the remainder of 2006.
 
"The second quarter will be another difficult comparison to prior year, with inflationary headwinds requiring us to continue to execute in the price, volume and productivity dimensions. Our intent is to continue to build earnings growth momentum while tightly managing cash flows," said McCracken.
 
Note (1)
 
 
(A)Prior to April 1, 2005, mark-to-market adjustments for changes in the unrealized value of natural gas hedge contracts were reported in results of operations. Beginning April 1, 2005, additional changes in the unrealized value of these contracts are being reported as changes in the Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners' equity through the application of special hedge accounting. The cumulative mark-to-market gain on the contracts that existed at April 1, 2005, will continue to impact reported energy costs until the last of those contracts expire in the fourth quarter of 2006. Both the non-cash gains reported prior to April 1, 2005, and the offsetting non-cash charges reported after that date are excluded from Segment Operating Profit. The remaining non-cash charges in 2006 will be $1.6 million in the second quarter, $1.6 million in the third quarter and $2.0 million in the fourth quarter.

Amount for three months ended March 31, 2005 includes a first quarter gain of $28.1 million (pretax and after tax) from the sale of the Company's glass container facility in Corsico, Italy. The effect of this adjustment is an increase in earnings per share of $0.18. The sale of the Company's glass container facility in Castellar, Spain did not result in a gain;  the carrying value allocated to that facility, as part of the BSN acquisition, was adjusted to equal the sales proceeds.
(a)
         
 
Amount for three months ended March 31, 2006 includes a loss of $3.5 million ($3.3 million after tax) from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts. The aftertax effect of this loss is a decrease in earnings per share of $0.02.
(b)
        
 
Amount for three months ended March 31, 2005 includes a gain of $28.4 million ($17.0 million after tax) from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts. The aftertax effect of this gain is an increase in earnings per share of $0.11.
 
 
 
 
(a)      Operating Profit consists of consolidated earnings before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority share owners' interests in earnings of subsidiaries. Segment Operating Profit excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
 
The Company presents Operating Profit because management believes that it provides investors with a measure of operating performance without regard to level of indebtedness or other related costs of capital. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Operating Profit is net earnings. The Company presents Segment Operating Profit because management uses the measure, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.
 
A reconciliation from Segment Operating Profit to Consolidated Operating Profit to net earnings is included in the tables above.
 
(b)      Excludes a loss of $3.5million and a gain of $28.4million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts.
 
(c)      Amount for the three months ended March 31, 2005 excludes a gain of $28.1 million for the sale of the Company's glass container facility in Corsico, Italy.
