Exhibit 99.1
O-I Reports Third Quarter Results
Operating profits improve moderately during difficult quarter
Perrysburg, Ohio, October 25, 2006 - Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE:OI) today reported its third quarter 2006 financial results.
"Progress in each of our six core priorities resulted in moderately improved quarter-over-quarter Segment Operating Profit despite the challenging cost environment," said Steve McCracken, O-I Chairman and CEO.  "Our $.02 reported earnings per share from continuing operations did not reflect this progress, principally due to the charge to close Godfrey, costs of refinancing, and a higher tax rate.  We have gained some momentum, but we have not yet met the expectations we set when we began this transformation.  The changes in our global glass leadership announced on October 3 will help to sharpen our focus and accelerate execution of the core priorities."
Third Quarter Highlights:
              Net earnings were $0.02 per share (diluted) compared with $0.75 per share (diluted) in 2005.
Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the following items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations, were $0.26 per share compared with $0.34 per share in 2005. Excluded items: (a)mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts; (b)note repurchase finance fees and premiums; and (c)the charge for the Godfrey plant closure, are explained in Note (1).
                                         
The Company's financial flexibility was improved by the negotiation of a new five year 300 million European accounts receivable securitization program which will reduce the Company's cost of borrowing by over 1% versus the expiring program.
                 
Management working capital (accounts receivable plus inventory and repair parts less accounts payable) at September 30, 2006 was 21.1% of last 12 months net sales compared with 23.1% at September 30, 2005.
                 
SAP is now deployed in approximately half of the European facilities with the remaining facilities scheduled to go-live' over the next five quarters.
                 
On September 1, the Company announced that it will close its Godfrey, Ill., machine parts manufacturing operation by the end of this year.  As part of a broad initiative to reduce working capital and improve system costs, machine parts manufacturing will be outsourced to various third party suppliers.  The Company recorded a third quarter charge for this closure of $29.7 million ($27.7 million after tax, or $0.18 per share).
                 
Asbestos metrics improved further during the quarter with cash payments to resolve cases and claims declining from $48.9 million to $46.9 million and deferred amounts payable declining by $4.0 million.
                 
Reconciliation of Third Quarter 2006 Earnings to Third Quarter 2005
Earnings per share, excluding the items listed in Note (1) as presented below, were $0.26 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2006 compared with $0.34 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2005. The major factors contributing to the net $0.08 per share decline were as follows:
Consolidated Net Debt and Free Cash Flow
Consolidated net debt at September 30, 2006 was $5,196.6 million, compared with $4,998.5 million at December 31, 2005 and $5,206.2 million at September 30, 2005. Consolidated net debt at September 30, 2006 represents a decrease of $9.6 million from September 30, 2005.

(a) Off balance sheet prior to December 2005.
Summarized cash flows for the third quarter 2006 and third quarter 2005 are as follows:
 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was $61.7 million compared with $190.8 million for the same quarter last year.  This reduction resulted from lower cash provided by operating activities partially offset by lower capital spending.  The unfavorable comparison in quarterly operating cash flow was principally due to working capital which provided $56.6 million in 2006 compared to $166.7 million in the prior year quarter. Capitalization of costs related to the SAP roll-out also had the effect of reducing cash flow from operating activities during the quarter.  On the favorable side, capital spending was lower in the third quarter 2006 due to the completion of the new glass container manufacturing facility in Windsor, Colo., in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Business Review
 Higher selling prices, improved productivity and increased unit shipments, drove improved quarter-over-quarter Segment Operating Profit.
Glass Containers Segment
Segment Operating Profit of $207.6 million in the third quarter of 2006 was $9.3 million or 4.7% higher than the Segment Operating Profit for the third quarter of 2005 of $198.3 million.

Glass shipments increased by 1% overall in the third quarter of 2006 vs. the third quarter of 2005.  Shipments increased in all regions except Europe where the elimination of selected lower margin products impacted volume.
                 
Increased selling prices, procurement savings, higher unit shipments, and cost savings from European capacity rationalization partially offset the impact of input cost inflation.
                 
The principal factors contributing to the $9.3 million increase in Operating Profit were as follows:
 
 Inflation in raw materials and other manufacturing costs and an unfavorable product sales mix were only partially offset by improved productivity and cost savings efforts, resulting in a modest decline in results compared to prior year. 
Plastics Packaging Segment
Segment Operating Profit for the third quarter of 2006 was $30.7 million, compared with $33.1 million in the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of $2.4 million.
Increased shipments of closures to certain end use markets were offset by lower unit shipments of healthcare bottles and vials. Customer consolidation and the expiration of certain contract manufacturing agreements with the purchaser of the former blow molded plastics business accounted for most of the reduction.
                 
In addition, a less favorable product sales mix and input cost inflation were partially offset by price increases, improved production efficiencies and other cost reduction initiatives.
                 
The principal factors contributing to the $2.4 million decrease in Operating Profit were as follows:

Capital Spending
Capital spending for the third quarter of 2006 totaled $75.9 million, compared with $111.1 million for the year ago quarter.  The lower capital spending was principally due to the completion of the new glass container manufacturing facility in Windsor, Colo., in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the third quarter of 2006 was $122.2 million compared with $113.3 million in the third quarter of 2005. As previously reported, interest expense in the third quarter includes $7.3 million for call premiums and the write-off of unamortized finance fees related to the July 2006 repurchase of approximately $150 million of the outstanding 2009, 8.875% senior secured notes.
Effective Tax Rate
Excluding the items presented in Note (1), the Company's effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2006 was 45.5%, compared with 32.1% for the third quarter of 2005.  The Company expects its full year 2006 effective tax rate, exclusive of separately taxed items, to be between 40% and 41%.  The 2006 effective tax rate is higher principally because the Company is no longer recording tax benefits on its losses in the United States.
Cash tax payments for the third quarter of 2006 amounted to $27.0 million compared with $26.5 million for the third quarter of 2005. The Company expects to pay cash taxes between $125 million and $135 million for the full year 2006.
Asbestos
Asbestos-related cash payments to resolve cases and claims in the ordinary course were $46.9 million during the third quarter of 2006 compared with $48.9 million for the third quarter of 2005.  In addition, the Company used a portion of previously collected insurance proceeds to reduce the deferred amount payable on prior settlements by $4.0 million during the quarter.  The deferred amount payable was approximately $84 million at September 30, 2006, compared with approximately $91 million at December 31, 2005.
New filings during the quarter were approximately 18% higher than the filings during the third quarter of 2005. While new filings for the third quarter of 2006 are up from the prior year quarter, filings for the nine months ended September 2006 are down 30% from the same period in 2005. In addition, new filings for the nine months ended September 2005 were 35% lower than filings for the comparable period in 2004.  As of September 30, 2006, the number of pending asbestos-related lawsuits and claims was approximately 24,000 compared with approximately 32,000 at December 31, 2005. The Company believes that a significant number of the currently pending cases have exposure dates after the Company's
5
1958 exit from the business, for which the Company takes the position that it has no liability or are subject to dismissal because they were filed in improper forums. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet its asbestos-related obligations on a short-term and long-term basis.
Nine-Month Results
For the first nine months of 2006, the Company reported earnings from continuing operations of $75.3 million or $0.38 per share (diluted) compared with $260.3 million, or $1.60 per share (diluted) for the first nine months of 2005.  Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the items listed in Note (1), were $126.6 million or $0.71 per share for the first nine months of 2006, compared with $218.8 million or $1.34 per share for the comparable 2005 period. Results for the first nine months of 2005 also included several non-operating items presented in Note (2) below. Exclusive of these items, the Company earned $1.27 per share in the nine months of 2005.
Outlook
"Despite our dissatisfaction with the pace of the transformation, we remain confident in our strategies and priorities as we enter the fourth quarter and look ahead to 2007.  We are committed to combat inflation with price and to walk away from unprofitable business.  Our recent organizational change will leverage the capabilities of the global glass business to enhance results and our speed of execution," said McCracken.

(A)Prior to April 1, 2005, mark-to-market adjustments for changes in the unrealized value of natural gas hedge contracts were reported in results of operations.  Beginning April 1, 2005, additional changes in the unrealized value of these contracts are being reported as changes in the Other Comprehensive Income component of share owners' equity through the application of special hedge accounting.  The cumulative mark-to-market gain on the contracts that existed at April 1, 2005, will continue to impact reported energy costs until the last of those contracts expire in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Both the non-cash gains reported prior to April 1, 2005, and the offsetting non-cash charges reported after that date are excluded from Segment Operating Profit.  The remaining non-cash charges in the fourth quarter of 2006 will be $2.0 million.
Note (2)
 In addition to the items presented in Note (1), the nine month 2005 results included first quarter favorable adjustments of $0.04 per share from a reduction of the Company's accruals for self-insured risks and $0.03 per share from a reduction of the tax provision primarily to recognize changes in deferred taxes at several international subsidiaries, both recognized in the first quarter of 2005.  Exclusive of these items, the Company earned $1.27 per share in the first nine months of 2005.
