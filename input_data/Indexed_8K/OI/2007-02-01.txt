O-I Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
2006 Concludes as Expected; New CEO Sets Stage for 2007
Perrysburg, Ohio, January 31, 2007  Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI) today reported its 2006 fourth quarter and full year financial results.
Fourth Quarter Net Sales:
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $1.877 billion, representing a 6.9 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2005.
Global glass container net sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by 9.1 percent to $1.699 billion compared with $1.558 billion for the same quarter last year.  Favorable currency exchange rates, improved pricing and sales mix, and increased shipments contributed 5.2 percent, 2.9 percent, and 1.0 percent, respectively, to the sales increase.
                 
Plastics packaging net sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $177 million compared to $197 million reported in the same quarter last year.  Sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $12.8 million from the Company's former plastics business in Australia, $2.6 million from the pass through of higher resin costs, and $2.2 million from transition contract manufacturing associated with its former blow-molded plastics business.  Exclusive of these items, sales for the quarter decreased 1.3 percent.
                 
Fourth Quarter Results and Fully Diluted Earnings per Share:
The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $102.8 million or $0.71 per share (diluted).  Last year the Company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $881.9 million or $5.86 per share (diluted).
This year's fourth quarter loss included three charges and two gains for items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.  A description of these items is shown below in Note 1.  Exclusive of these items, 2006 fourth quarter net earnings were $22.9 million or $0.11 per share (diluted).  This compares with $10.5 million or $0.03 per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company continued to operate most factories at normal levels during the fourth quarter of 2006 and did not repeat the temporary line shutdowns taken in November and December of 2005 to adjust inventory levels.  A reconciliation from the $0.71 per share net loss (GAAP) to the $0.11 per share earnings (non-GAAP) is shown below in Note 1.
Full Year Net Sales:
Net sales for 2006 were $7.422 billion compared to $7.079 billion reported last year, a 4.8 percent increase.
Global glass container net sales for 2006 increased 6.1 percent to $6.650 billion compared with $6.267 million net sales for 2005.  Improved price and product mix was the most significant factor, contributing 3.7 percent while favorable exchange rates accounted for 1.4 percent of the sales improvement.  Glass shipments were stronger in North America, South America and the Asia Pacific region compared to 2005, but weaker in Europe over the same period.  Overall, global glass shipments were up approximately 1.0 percent compared with 2005 when measured in both tons and units.
                 
Plastics packaging net sales were $772 million in 2006 including $18 million of resin cost inflation passed through to customers during the year.  Plastics packaging sales in 2005 were $812 million and included sales from the Company's former Australian plastics business and from contract manufacturing associated with the Company's former blow-molded
                 
plastics business which totaled $58 million more than in 2006.  On the same basis, year over year unit sales increased 6.1 percent in 2006 compared with the prior year, including a 27.0 percent increase in international closure unit sales.
Full Year Results and Fully Diluted Earnings per Share:
The net loss for the full year 2006 was $27.5 million or $0.32 per share (diluted) compared to a net loss of $558.6 million or $3.85 per share (diluted) for the full year 2005.
The full year net loss included five charges and two gains from items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.  A description of these items is shown below in Note 2.  Exclusive of these items, 2006 full year net earnings were $149.5 million or $0.83 per share (diluted).  This compares with $220.9 million or $1.30 per share (diluted) in 2005.  The decrease in earnings was primarily due to less than full recovery of cost inflation, slower realization of expected benefits from achievement of core priorities, and the impact of the four non-operating items (pension expense, effective tax rate, stock option accounting, and foreign currency) described at the beginning of the year. A reconciliation from the $0.32 per share net loss (GAAP) to the $0.83 per share earnings(non-GAAP) is shown below in Note 2.
"This past year has been a year of change and great challenge for O-I," said Al Stroucken, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Dealing with rising input costs coupled with the immense undertaking of transforming our firm financially, culturally, and strategically has put our entire organization to the test.  While we learned several hard lessons in 2006, we also saw examples of exceptional performance that have reinforced our belief in the Company's long-term strategy.  Looking forward, we will build on those experiences and add value through pricing discipline, focus on cost structure, and managing our return on assets to improve our results in 2007."
Cash Flow, Working Capital, and Debt:
Cash provided by operating activities was $150.3 million in 2006 and $453.1 million in 2005.  Free Cash Flow (defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital spending plus collections on receivables arising from securitization) was $115.6 million in the fourth quarter 2006 compared with $146.2 million during the same quarter last year.  For the full year, Free Cash Flow was a use of $42.7 million compared with a source of $99.7 million in 2005.  Increased production and sales activities, principally in the fourth quarter of 2006, resulted in year-over-year inventory growth of $98.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable (including securitization) of $91.6 million.  Full year capital expenditures of $320.3 million were down significantly from $404.1 million in 2005, partially offsetting the cash effect of the unfavorable change in working capital.  Total debt during the year increased by $159.6 million to $5.457 billion, as of December 31, 2006.  Netting cash and short-term investments results in debt of $5.201 billion as of December 31, 2006 as compared with $4.999 billion at 2005 year end.  The increase in debt includes $74 million resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Effective Tax Rate and Cash Tax Payments:
The Company's reported effective tax rate was 88.7 percent in 2006 and (167.9) percent in 2005.  Excluding the items presented in Note 2, the Company's effective tax rate for the full year 2006 was 40.3 percent compared to 29.9 percent for the full year 2005.  The 2006 effective tax rate increased principally because the Company is no longer recording tax benefits on its
losses in the United States.  A shift in mix of earnings towards higher tax cost countries in other regions of the world also increased the effective tax rate for the year.
Cash tax payments in 2006 amounted to $125.6 million and were essentially flat compared to $125.1 million for 2005.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Other Fourth Quarter Items:
The Company recorded several charges and credits in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to critical accounting estimates and other items disclosed in its 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, 10-Q's from the first three quarterly reporting periods in 2006, or 8-K's filed during 2006.
- - The Company conducted its annual comprehensive review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for the full year 2006.  As a result of that review, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $120.0 million (pre-tax and after tax) to increase the accrual for future asbestos-related costs.  In 2005, the Company increased its accrual for future asbestos-related costs by $135.0 million ($86.0 million after tax).  As of December 31, 2006, the Company's accrual for future asbestos-related costs was $687.6 million, of which $149.0 million is classified as a current liability.
Asbestos
- As a result of certain improvements in retiree medical benefits offered by the government of The Netherlands, the Company recorded a gain of $15.9 million ($11.2 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to curtailment of certain Company sponsored postretirement benefits.  Also, as a result of its implementation of FAS No. 158, the Company recorded a net reduction of $639.9 million ($617.1 after tax) to the other comprehensive income component of share owners' equity in the quarter.  This non-cash adjustment reflects the amount required to record the obligations of the Company's various pension and retiree benefit plans, net of related plan assets, and does not affect earnings.
Pension and other postretirement benefits
- - In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $5.7 million from the reversal of a valuation allowance against certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to improving operations, partially offset by charges related to international tax restructuring.  In addition, the net reduction to other comprehensive income resulting from the implementation of FAS No. 158, as described above, includes a $197.5 million increase in the valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets.
Tax matters
The Company recorded a fourth quarter charge associated with the separation agreement of former CEO Steve McCracken and of several members of the European management team.  The $20.8 million pre-tax charge ($20.7 million after tax) also included costs described in the Company's Form 8-K filing related to the employment agreement with new CEO Al Stroucken.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expanded the capacity of its European accounts receivable securitization program.

Cash inflows related to receipts from customers in payment of the accounts receivable consolidated at December 13, 2005 have been classified as investing cash inflows in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Operating Profit consists of consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority share owners' interests in earnings of subsidiaries.  Segment Operating Profit excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
(a)
         
The Company presents Operating Profit because management believes that it provides investors with a measure of operating performance without regard to level of indebtedness or other related costs of capital.

The Company presents Segment Operating Profit because management uses the measure, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.
