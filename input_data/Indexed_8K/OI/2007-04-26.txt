O-I Reports First Quarter Results
Global Glass Operations Showing Signs of Improved Performance
Perrysburg, Ohio, April 25, 2007  Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI) today reported financial results for the first quarter that ended March 31, 2007.
First Quarter Net Sales:
Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2007 increased 10.9% to $1.872 billion compared with $1.688 billion for the first quarter of 2006.
Global Glass Container net sales for the first quarter of 2007 were $1.684 billion compared with $1.489 billion for the same quarter last year, a 13% increase.  Favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed 5% while improved volume, improved product sales mix, and modestly improved prices contributed 8%.  Globally, the Company sold 5.5% more tons of glass quarter over quarter, led by South America and Europe.
                 
Plastics Packaging net sales for the first quarter of 2007 were $188.3 million compared with $199.6 million reported in the same quarter last year.  Modestly higher unit sales of closures and prescription products during the first quarter of 2007 were more than offset by the non-recurrence of $7.9 million of sales from the Company's former plastics business in Australia and $3.3 million of sales from transition contract manufacturing with the Company's former blow-molded plastics business in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2006.  In addition, sales were reduced by $6.3 million from lower resin costs passed through to customers.  Excluding these items, Plastics Packaging net sales for the first quarter 2007 were up 3.4% compared with the prior year period.
                 
First Quarter Operating Results:
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2007 increased to $53.2 million.  Last year, the Company reported first quarter net earnings of $24.3 million.  The improved profitability was mainly the result of considerably better glass factory operating performance and the effect of contractual price adjustment formulas for prior year cost inflation.  Profitability was also helped by increased volume and stronger currency exchange rates primarily in Europe and Australia.
First Quarter Earnings per Share:
The Company reported earnings per share of $0.30 (diluted) for the first quarter of 2007 compared with $0.12 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2006.  Exclusive of a $0.02 per share after tax loss from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedges, which the Company considers not representative of ongoing operations, the Company earned $0.14 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2006.
"I am pleased with the solid progress our global glass team has made with its productivity and cost improvement initiatives," said Al Stroucken, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are still early in our margin recovery efforts and we are certain to face challenges along the way, especially in the face of a rapidly changing competitive landscape. However, I believe that we are on the right path to transform our business model and demonstrate improved performance."

Working Capital, Capital Spending, Cash Flow, and Debt:
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company's use of cash for working capital was $186.1 million.  This compares favorably to a use of $240.5 million in the first quarter of 2006 ($363.3 million for working capital offset by $122.8 million from the accounts receivable securitization program).
During the first quarter of 2007 the Company reported $41.4 million in capital expenditures and $119.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense.  The Company expects full year capital expenditures for 2007 will not exceed $350 million while depreciation and amortization expense will finish the year between $475 million and $500 million.
Cash utilized in operating activities was $44.1 million in the first quarter of 2007 and $274.4 million in the same quarter of 2006.  Consistent with the seasonal nature of the business, Free Cash Flow (defined as cash provided by operating activities plus collections on receivables arising from securitization less capital spending) was negative $85.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with negative $205.0 million during the same quarter last year. The Company expects Free Cash Flow for the full year to exceed $150 million versus a negative Free Cash Flow of $42.7 million in 2006.
During the first quarter of 2007, total debt increased by $197.2 million to $5.654 billion largely because of the negative Free Cash Flow combined with a $71 million increase in cash.  The quarterly increase in debt also included $18.0 million resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  As of March 31, 2007 the Company had more than $800 million available under its U.S. secured revolving credit facility.
Asbestos:
New claims filed during the quarter were 5% lower than the first quarter of 2006.  Asbestos-related cash payments to resolve cases and claims in the ordinary course during the first quarter were $41.0 million, equal to the first quarter of 2006.  As of March 31, 2007 the total pending asbestos-related lawsuits and claims remained at approximately 18,000 and the deferred amount payable for previously settled claims was $81.4 million.
Euro Bond Offering:
, OI European Group B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary, issued 300 million ($396 million USD) of 6.875%, senior unsecured notes with a maturity of March 31, 2017.  The proceeds will be used to retire $300 million of the Company's 8.10% senior notes which mature in May 2007 and to reduce borrowings under the U.S. secured revolving credit facility.
On March 14
th
Effective Tax Rate:
The effective income tax rate was 37.2% in the first quarter of 2007 as compared to 39.0% in the first quarter of 2006 (exclusive of the mark to market loss on natural gas hedges).  The lower rate was primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the continued implementation of the new business model in Europe.  Based upon the current expectations for the mix of earnings for 2007, the Company anticipates that its effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 35%.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expanded the capacity of its European accounts receivable securitization program. The terms of this expansion resulted in changing from off-balance sheet to on-balance sheet accounting for the program by consolidating both the trade accounts receivable in the program and the secured indebtedness of the same amount. Cash inflows related to receipts from customers in payment of the accounts receivable consolidated at December 13, 2005 have been classified as investing cash inflows in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Certain amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.  These amounts have been reclassified from operating activities to investing activities.

Operating Profit consists of consolidated earnings before interest income, interest expense, provision for income taxes and minority share owners' interests in earnings of subsidiaries.  Segment Operating Profit excludes amounts related to certain items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
(a)
            
The Company presents Operating Profit because management believes that it provides investors with a measure of operating performance without regard to level of indebtedness or other related costs of capital.  The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Operating Profit is net earnings.  The Company presents Segment Operating Profit because management uses the measure, in combination with selected cash flow information, to evaluate performance and to allocate resources.
A reconciliation from Segment Operating Profit to Consolidated Operating Profit to net earnings is included in the tables above.
Excludes a loss of $3.5million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 from the mark to market effect of natural gas hedge contracts.
