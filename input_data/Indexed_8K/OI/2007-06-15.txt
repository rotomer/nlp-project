Exhibit 99.1
O-I to Sell Plastics Packaging Business to Rexam PLC
PERRYSBURG, Ohio  June 11, 2007 - Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE: OI) today announced that the Company concluded the strategic review process of its plastics portfolio and has entered into a definitive agreement with Rexam PLC to sell its plastics packaging business.
Total consideration for the business (including tax basis step-up) will be approximately $1.825 billion, to be paid in cash at closing.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, O-I Plastics had revenues of approximately $760 million.
The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of both Rexam and O-I, is expected to close early in the third quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and Rexam shareholder approval.  O-I intends to use the majority of the sale proceeds to reduce senior secured debt maturing in 2009, 2011 and 2012.  As a result of existing tax loss carryforwards, O-I expects to have only minimal federal cash tax liability from the sale transaction.
"I am pleased with the outcome of our strategic review process and am extremely confident that O-I's Plastics business will be in very good hands," said Al Stroucken, O-I chairman and chief executive officer.
