As of June 30, 2007, Owens-Illinois, Inc. will report the plastics packaging business as a discontinued operation, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  See the Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The pro forma adjustments included herein are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable and are described in the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily represent what Owens-Illinois, Inc.'s financial position or results of operations would have been had the sale of the plastics packaging business occurred on such dates or to project Owens-Illinois, Inc.'s financial position or results of operations at or for any future date or period.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma financial information have been made. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Owens-Illinois, Inc.
 
 
 
The Pro Forma Adjustments represents the June 30, 2007 balances of the assets and liabilities of the plastics packaging business that were divested on July 31, 2007, as well as the related cash proceeds received from the divestiture.

The actual interest rate under the Secured Credit Agreement for the respective periods was applied to that portion of the net proceeds equal to the total amounts outstanding under the Secured Credit Agreement during such periods.  The weighted average interest rate on the Company's outstanding senior secured notes was applied to the balance of the net proceeds.
