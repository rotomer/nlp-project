O-I Reports Improved Results in the First Quarter 2008
 
Sales and earnings continue to grow
 
Perrysburg, Ohio, April 30, 2008  Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI) today reported financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2008.
 
First Quarter Net Sales from Continuing Operations Increase 16%
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.961 billion for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $1.684 billion a year ago, an increase of $277 million. Favorable currency translation contributed $187 million while improved price and product sales mix added $119 million to the quarterly sales increase. These two factors more than outweighed the $49 million decrease from fewer tons sold.
 
On July 31, 2007 the Company sold its Plastics Packaging business. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, prior year amounts related to that business have been reclassified and reported as discontinued operations.
 
First Quarter Earnings from Continuing Operations Triples
 
The Company's earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008 increased to $174.0 million, compared with $55.3 million a year ago. Earnings for the quarter included an after tax charge of $9.7 million for restructuring that management considers not representative of ongoing operations. A description of this item is shown below in Note 1. Exclusive of the restructuring charge, 2008 first quarter earnings were $183.7 million, compared with $55.3 million in the same quarter last year.
 
The increase in earnings was driven primarily by an improvement in price and product sales mix. This improvement was partially offset by higher manufacturing input costs for energy and raw materials, higher costs related to transportation, and reduced sales volume. Lower net interest expense and a lower worldwide effective tax rate also contributed to the earnings improvement.
 
First Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations more than Triples
 
The Company earned $1.02 per share (diluted) from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of 2007. Exclusive of the restructuring charge (see Note 1), earnings per share increased to $1.08 (diluted) in the first quarter of 2008 from $0.31 (diluted) in the same quarter last year. A description of the item management considers not representative of ongoing operations and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share can be found in the tables accompanying this release and in charts on the Company's Web site (www.o-i.com).
 
"As expected, our performance in the first quarter continued to build on the solid foundation we've established over the past year," said Al Stroucken, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our results reflect a more robust process for capturing manufacturing efficiencies, operating improvements and a more disciplined strategy that favors price over volume. We continue on our mission to build a stronger, leaner and more flexible business, positioned for further growth."
First Quarter Free Cash Flow Improves by $48 Million
 
The Company generated cash of $20.7 million from continuing operating activities in the first quarter of 2008. This compares with a cash use of $40.2 million in the same quarter of 2007. Free Cash Flow (defined as cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital spending for continuing operations) was a use of $24.7 million in the first quarter of 2008, compared with a use of $72.8 million in the first quarter of 2007, an improvement of $48.1 million. The reduction in cash usage resulted primarily from improved earnings, partially offset by a larger seasonal increase in working capital and moderately higher capital spending compared with the prior year quarter. At current exchange rates, management expects that the Company will generate approximately $500 million Free Cash Flow in 2008.
 
During the first quarter of 2008, working capital was a $216.8 million use of cash, compared with a use of $172.5 million during the same period in 2007. The Company reported $45.4 million in capital expenditures for continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of $12.8 million compared with the same quarter last year. For the full year, the Company expects maintenance and restructuring capital expenditures for the current manufacturing footprint to be in the range of 80% to 85% of expected depreciation and amortization expense for the year.
 
Total Debt Balance of $4.0 Billion
 
As of March 31, 2008, the Company's total debt balance was $4.028 billion, compared with $5.654 billion as of March 31, 2007 and $3.714 billion as of December 31, 2007. The $314 million increase in debt during the first quarter of 2008 includes approximately $144 million for the effects of foreign currency translation and fair value adjustments of interest rate swaps. At the end of the first quarter of 2008, the Company had more than $725 million of available capacity under its secured revolving credit facility.
 
Effective Tax Rate Decreases
 
The Company's reported tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 25.4% as compared with 36.6% in the prior year quarter. The reduction is principally due to:  (1) a change in mix of earnings to jurisdictions where the Company is subject to lower effective rates, and (2) the effect of higher earnings and lower interest expense in the U.S., where the Company has recognized a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. Based on the current earnings mix projection for 2008, the Company expects that the full-year effective tax rate will be slightly below the 24.4% effective tax rate for 2007.
 
Asbestos-Related Payments Down Slightly
 
Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007. The deferred amount payable for previously settled claims was down 6% from year end 2007 to a balance of $31.6 million at the end of the first quarter. New claims filed during the first quarter of 2008 were approximately 32% lower than the prior year quarter. The number of pending asbestos-related lawsuits and claims was approximately 14,000 as of March 31, 2008, unchanged from December 31, 2007.
Outlook for 2008
 
"With rising energy and other input costs, the balance of 2008 will be a challenge," said Stroucken. "But I remain confident in the capabilities and dedication of O-I employees to ensure that the strategies we've put into place will deliver solid results. Going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to expand our footprint in attractive geographies and to work with our customers to develop innovative glass packaging that will help distinguish their brands in the marketplace."
 
Note 1:
 
The table below represents items in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007 that management considers not representative of ongoing operations.
 
 
Regulation G
 
The information presented above regarding earnings from continuing operations exclusive of items management considers not representative of ongoing operations does not conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management has included this non-GAAP information to assist in understanding the comparability of results of ongoing operations. Management uses this non-GAAP information principally for internal reporting, forecasting, budgeting and calculating bonus payments. Management believes that the excluded items are not reflective of ongoing operations, so the non-GAAP presentation allows the board of directors, management, investors and analysts to better understand the Company's financial performance in relationship to core operating results and the business outlook.
