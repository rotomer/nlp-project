Exhibit 99.1
 
O-I to Close Toronto, Ontario, Glass Container Plant
 
PERRYSBURG, Ohio, July 29, 2008  Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE: OI) announced today that as a result of the ongoing review of its global manufacturing footprint, the company will close its glass container plant in Toronto, Ontario, on September 30, 2008. Existing production from the Toronto plant will be transferred to other O-I facilities, including those in nearby Brampton, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec.
 
"This closing was driven by our global asset utilization process which identified the opportunity to shift our production to other O-I North American facilities, resulting in lower energy consumption and production costs while still meeting current and anticipated market needs," said Scott Murchison, president, North America Glass Containers. "The market impacts of a strong Canadian dollar, high energy prices and the recent activities of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario were contributing factors."
 
Approximately 430 employees will be affected.
The company will provide assistance to help employees seeking new jobs.
