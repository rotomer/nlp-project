Exhibit 99.1
 
O-I Revises Outlook for 2008 Free Cash Flow
 
PERRYSBURG, Ohio, September 16, 2008  Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE OI) announced today that it expects Free Cash Flow for 2008 to range between $400 million and last year's $332 million, down from the $500 million anticipated earlier this year.
 
The company's outlook for Free Cash Flow has been reduced due to the following:
 
                 
Weakening demand for the company's products associated with continuing declines in the economies in Europe and the U.S.;
 
                 
Further actions by the company in response to weaker demand projections, including the extension of short-term capacity shutdowns previously planned for the fourth quarter  to control inventory levels;
 
                 
Acceleration of cash payments attributable to the recent announcements for the permanent closures of the plants in Lavington, Canada, and Castel Maggiore, Italy;
 
                 
Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies over the last two months, especially the Euro and the Australian dollar.
 
"The fundamentals of O-I have not changed and we remain focused on the strategies we have been pursuing throughout the year," said Ed White, Senior Vice President and CFO.
 
Free Cash Flow is defined by the Company as cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures.  The company views Free Cash Flow as an important measure of the performance of its operations and for allocation of resources.

Exhibit 99.2
 
O-I Announces Share Repurchase Authorization
 
PERRYSBURG, Ohio, September 16, 2008  Owens-Illinois, Inc., (NYSE OI) announced today that its Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing management to repurchase up to $350 million of the Company's outstanding common shares until December 31, 2010.
 
"We believe that the Company has substantial prospects for continued earnings growth and the current share price does not reflect the long term value of the firm," said Al Stroucken, Chairman and CEO.  "As we evaluate investment alternatives, the repurchase of our stock represents another attractive opportunity to deliver value for our shareholders."
 
Repurchases may take place on the open market or through private transactions from time to time based on market conditions, subject to certain conditions and timing restrictions to comply with applicable rules and regulations and may be suspended for periods or  discontinued as deemed necessary by the Company. Decisions about these matters will be based on market conditions, general business conditions and other relevant factors. If conditions are not favorable, then no purchases will be made.
