Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
On May 20, 2010, Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc. ("OB Glass"), a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Owens-Illinois, Inc. ("OI Inc."), issued $90,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes") which are exchangeable based on shares of common stock of OI Inc. The Notes were issued pursuant to the initial purchasers' option to purchase an additional $90,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture dated May 7, 2010, by and among OB Glass, OI Inc., the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, paying agent and registrar (the "Indenture").  The Notes will pay interest semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 at a rate of 3.00% per annum, and will mature on June 1, 2015. The Notes were offered and sold to initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  The initial purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
 
As previously reported in our Report on Form 8-K dated May 3, 2010, OB Glass issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the initial purchasers on May 7, 2010.  The Indenture for the Notes is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to such report.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized
