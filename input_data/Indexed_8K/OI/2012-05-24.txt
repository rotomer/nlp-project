This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (the "Amendment") updates information disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 25, 2012 (the "Original Form 8-K") announcing the pending retirement of Edward C. White and the appointment of Stephen P. Bramlage, Jr. as Mr. White's successor.  The sole purpose of this Amendment is to update certain information relating to the effective dates of Mr. White's retirement and Mr. Bramlage's appointment in the Original Form 8-K.  Except as described herein, this Amendment does not modify or update any other information contained in the Original Form 8-K.
 
On May 21, 2012, Owens-Illinois, Inc. (the "Company") determined that Mr. White's retirement, and Mr. Bramlage's appointment as Chief Financial Officer, will become effective June 1, 2012.  The Company made this decision due to the completed transition, which occurred earlier than anticipated, of Mr. Bramlage's responsibilities as President of the Company's Oceania and Asia Pacific operations to Sergio Galindo, formerly the General Manager of the Company's Colombia operations.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
