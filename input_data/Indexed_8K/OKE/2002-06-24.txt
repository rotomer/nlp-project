SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 June 21, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported) ONEOK, Inc. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Oklahoma 001-13643 73-1520922 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of incorporation) File Number) Identification No.) 100 West Fifth Street; Tulsa, OK (Address of principal executive offices) 74103 (Zip code) (918) 588-7000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure - ------- ----------------------------------------- On June 21, 2002, ONEOK, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a 90-day extension of its $850 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 12 banks, led by Bank of America, N.A. The amended credit facility becomes effective June 27, 2002. The credit facility, which was originally scheduled to expire on June 27, 2002, has been extended to the earlier of (1) September 30, 2002, (2) if the Company elects to do so, the date on which the Company purchases any shares of the Company's common or preferred stock owned by Westar Energy Inc., formerly Western Resources, and its subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., (collectively, "Western"), or (3) the date the Company enters into a new loan or credit agreement providing for extensions of credit to the Company. The credit facility, as extended, continues to provide that loan proceeds may be used by the Company to provide liquidity for commercial paper, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, mergers and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility, as extended, provides that no portion of loan proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of capital stock of the Company. If the Company elects to purchase the shares of the Company's common or preferred stock from Western and regulatory approval is required for such purchase, the credit facility may be extended to November 29, 2002 with approval of the lenders. As previously reported, on May 30, 2002 Western delivered a sale notice (the "Sale Notice") to the Company giving notice of Western's intent to sell 4,714,434 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") and 19,946,448 shares of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") representing all of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock of the Company beneficially owned by Western. Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement between the Company and Western dated November 26, 1997, (the "Shareholder Agreement"), the delivery of the Sale Notice to the Company gives the Company or its designee the option to purchase, for a period of 90 days after the date of the Sale Notice, all, but not less than all, of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock at a price equal to 98.5% of the average of the closing prices of the Company's Common Stock during the 20 trading days prior to the date of the Sale Notice. This sale period can be extended 30 days after any necessary regulatory approvals, but cannot exceed 180 days after the date of the Sale Notice. The Company believes that the extension of its credit facility provides the Company with the flexibility to consider its options regarding Western's proposed sale of its equity stake in the Company. The Company is carefully reviewing its options under the Shareholder Agreement and will take such action as the Company believes is in the best interest of ONEOK shareholders. 2

EXHIBIT 10.1 FIRST AMENDMENT AND EXTENSION OF 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT ---------------------------------- THIS AMENDMENT AND EXTENSION OF 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment and Extension") is effective as of the Effective Date (as defined herein), among ONEOK, INC., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the "Administrative Agent") and as a Lender, Letter of Credit Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender, and the Lenders. RECITALS -------- WHEREAS, the Company, the Administrative Agent and certain financial institutions (including the Administrative Agent, the "Lenders") are parties to that certain $850,000,000 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of June 28, 2001 (the "Credit Agreement"); WHEREAS, the Maturity Date (as therein defined) of the Credit Agreement is June 27, 2002; WHEREAS, the undersigned Lenders desire to make certain amendments to the Credit Agreement and extend the Maturity Date of the Credit Agreement; NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: Paragraph 1. Definitions. Unless otherwise defined in this Amendment and ----------- Extension, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Credit Agreement. Paragraph 2. Amendment of certain definitions in the Credit Agreement. -------------------------------------------------------- (a) Effective as of the Effective Date, the definition of "Applicable Amount" contained in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: "Applicable Amount" means, for any day, with respect to outstanding ----------------- Loans of the Types referred to below, and the facility fees, utilization fees and letter of credit fees referred to below, as the case may be, the per annum amount set forth below under the caption "Facility Fee", "Applicable Margin for Offshore Rate Loans", "Utilization Fee" or "Letter of Credit Fee", as the case may be, based upon the ratings by Moody's and S&P, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt (hereinafter defined):
For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in the lowest of the categories above; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different categories which are one level apart, the Applicable Amount shall be based on the lower of the two ratings, and if the ratings shall fall within different categories which are more than one level apart, the Applicable Amount shall be based on the level that is one level higher than the lower of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency. "Index Debt" means senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness ---------- for borrowed money of the Company that is not guaranteed by any other Person or subject to any other credit enhancement. Each change in the Applicable Amount shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Amount shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. (b) Effective as of the Effective Date, the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" contained in Section 1.1 of the Credit ----------------------- Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 2
"Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a material adverse effect upon the ----------------------- business, operations, properties, assets, business prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided however, a downgrade by S&P and/or Moody's of their respective rating of the Company's Index Debt shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect, but for purposes of clarity in interpreting the foregoing, it is agreed that the event, change, circumstance or condition that causes such downgrade (or an announcement of a potential downgrade or a review for possible ratings change) of the Company's Index Debt rating, and the effect or change caused by such downgrade (or an announcement of a potential downgrade or a review for possible ratings change) of the Company's Index Debt rating, will be considered in whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect; provided further the fact that the Company is unable to issue Indebtedness in the commercial paper market due to market conditions generally affecting the commercial paper market shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) a material impairment of the ability of the Company to perform the Obligations or of the Lenders to enforce the Obligations. Paragraph 3. Amendment to Section 2.14 of the Credit Agreement. Effective ------------------------------------------------- as of the Effective Date, Section 2.14 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 2.14 Use of Proceeds of Loans. The Company may use the proceeds of ------------------------ Loans to provide liquidity for commercial paper, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, mergers, and other general corporate purposes not in contravention of any Requirement of Law or of any Loan Document; provided however, (i) no portion of the proceeds of any Loan ---------------- shall be used in connection with the acquisition of a voting interest of five percent or more in any Person if such acquisition is opposed by the board of directors or management of such Person, (ii) no portion of the proceeds of any Loan shall be used in connection with the purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition, either directly or indirectly, of any shares of capital stock of the Company of any class, and (iii) no portion of the proceeds of any Loan shall be used to repay, reduce, exercise any call or re-purchase or purchase option with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or be used to deposit or place any amounts with a trustee or any other Person for the purpose of covenant defeasance, cancellation, or to in any way, release the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company from any obligations under any indenture, note agreement, purchase agreement or other agreement pursuant to which Indebtedness is incurred. Solely for the purposes of this Section ------- 2.14, the term "Indebtedness" shall not include commercial paper issued by ---- the Company the proceeds of which were not used in a manner that would be a prohibited use of the proceeds of Loans pursuant to subsections (ii) or (iii) this Section 2.14. ------------ Paragraph 4. Extension. Effective as of the Effective Date, the definition --------- of "Maturity Date" in Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "Maturity Date" shall mean the earlier of (i) September 30, 2002; (ii) ------------- the date that the Company purchases any common or preferred shares of the Company owned by Western Resources, Inc., Westar Industries, Inc., and/or an affiliate of Western Resources, Inc. or Westar Industries, Inc.; and (iii) in the event the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company enters into a loan agreement or credit agreement providing for extensions of credit to the Company or any Subsidiary, the effective date of such agreement; unless the Commitments are sooner terminated pursuant to Section 8.2 or any other ----------- provision of this Credit Agreement; provided however, in the case that ---------------- regulatory approvals are required for the Company to purchase the shares referred to in paragraph --------- 3
(ii) of this definition, in the event that all Lenders subsequently agree -- in writing, the Maturity Date may be extended to November 29, 2002, provided however, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate any Lenders to agree to such extension.
