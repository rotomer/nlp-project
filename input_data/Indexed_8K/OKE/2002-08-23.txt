SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 August 22, 2002 (Date of earliest event reported) ONEOK, Inc. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Oklahoma 001-13643 73-1520922 (State or other jurisdiction (Commission (IRS Employer of incorporation) File Number) Identification No.) 100 West Fifth Street; Tulsa, OK (Address of principal executive offices) 74103 (Zip code) (918) 588-7000 (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report)
Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure On August 22, 2002 ONEOK, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it will not purchase Westar Industries, Inc.'s 42.5 percent stake in the Company. Westar Industries, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Westar Energy, Inc. (formerly known as Western Resources, Inc.), offered the stake to the Company on May 30, 2002 under the terms of Westar's Shareholder Agreement with the Company. Westar's equity holdings in the Company consist of approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock and 19.9 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock, which Westar acquired in 1997 as consideration for the Company's purchase of Westar's gas distribution assets in Kansas. Following Westar's sale notice, the Company had 90 days, until August 28, 2002, to make a decision whether to purchase all the shares at the $21.77 per share price contained in the sale notice for a total price of approximately $971.1 million. The total price of $971.1 million is derived from a calculation which doubles the number of convertible preferred shares to reflect the previous two-for-one split in the Company's common stock, making the total number of shares for calculation purposes 44.6 million shares. Because the Company will not be purchasing the shares, Westar has until September 30, 2003 to complete a sale. However, throughout this period, the Shareholder Agreement, which includes various standstill and other arrangements applicable to Westar, will remain in effect. Item 7.

Exhibit 99.1 [LOGO OF ONEOK] Financial News - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- August 22, 2002 Contact: Weldon Watson 918-588-7158 ONEOK DECIDES NOT TO PURCHASE WESTAR'S ONEOK STAKE Company to focus on building shareholder value through growth, profitability and performance TULSA, Oklahoma - ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced that it will not purchase Westar Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:WR) 42.5 percent stake in ONEOK. Westar offered the stake to ONEOK on May 30, 2002 under the terms of its Shareholder Agreement with ONEOK. Westar's equity holdings in ONEOK consist of approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock and 19.9 million shares of series A convertible preferred stock, which it acquired in 1997 as consideration for ONEOK's purchase of Westar's gas distribution assets in Kansas. Following Westar's sale notice, ONEOK had 90 days, until August 28, 2002, to make a decision whether to purchase all the shares at the $21.77 per share price contained in the sale notice for a total price of approximately $971.1 million. (The total price of $971.1 million is derived from a calculation which doubles the number of convertible preferred shares to reflect the previous two-for-one split in ONEOK's common stock, making the total number of shares for calculation purposes 44.6 million shares.) Because ONEOK will not be purchasing the shares, Westar has until September 30, 2003 to complete a sale. However, throughout this period, the Shareholder Agreement, which includes various standstill and other arrangements applicable to Westar, will remain in effect. David Kyle, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK, said, "Our management team and Board of Directors reviewed the opportunities available to us under the terms of our Shareholder Agreement with Westar. After careful deliberation and consultation with our legal and financial advisors, we concluded that, at this time and under these conditions, purchasing Westar's shares is not in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. We believe we can build greater value by preserving our financial flexibility and continuing to execute on our proven growth strategy. "At a time when our industry is facing significant challenges, ONEOK's powerful asset mix, strategic focus and strong balance sheet have enabled us to achieve solid results. Going forward, we intend to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue building value by seeking attractive opportunities to maximize our existing assets and operations and positively
impact our earnings performance," Mr. Kyle concluded. Over the past several years, ONEOK has transformed itself from a mid-sized Oklahoma gas provider into a strong, profitable and diversified leader in the energy industry by pursuing a highly disciplined and deliberate growth strategy. From wellhead to burner tip, ONEOK has built a combination of regulated and non-regulated businesses that are unmatched in the asset-rich Mid Continent region. ONEOK's midstream acquisitions have moved ONEOK into the top 10 nationally for natural gas liquids production. Its asset-backed energy marketing operations reach more than 28 states, and the company continues to be a key player in the retail natural gas markets in Oklahoma and Kansas.
