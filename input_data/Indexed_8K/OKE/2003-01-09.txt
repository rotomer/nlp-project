Transactions with Westar Energy, Inc. and Westar Industries, Inc.
 
On January 9, 2003, we entered into a transaction agreement with Westar Energy and Westar Industries, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westar Energy, pursuant to which we agreed to, among other things, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect offerings of our common stock and other securities and to use a portion of the net proceeds of those offerings to repurchase a portion of the shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries. We have also agreed to modify the terms of the remaining shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock by exchanging newly issued shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock for all the shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries that we do not repurchase. At the same time, we also entered into a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement with Westar Energy and Westar Industries that, when effective, will replace the current shareholder agreement and the current registration rights agreement with Westar Energy. The new shareholder agreement and the new registration rights agreement will not become effective until both the repurchase and the exchange are completed. Both the repurchase and the exchange are conditioned upon, among other things, Westar Energy receiving the approval of the Kansas Corporation Commission with respect to the repurchase, the exchange and the new shareholder agreement.
 
The total number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series D convertible preferred stock to be issued in the exchange will be equal to the total number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of all of the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock currently outstanding less the total number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock that we will repurchase.
 
In addition, we have agreed to register for resale, within 60 days from the date the repurchase and exchange is consummated, all of the shares of our common stock held by Westar Industries, as well as all the shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock to be issued to Westar Industries and all the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of those shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock.
 
In addition, concurrent with the completion of the repurchase and the exchange, we will enter into an amended and restated rights agreement, which will amend and restate our current rights agreement in its entirety. Set forth below are summaries of the transaction agreement, the new shareholder agreement and the new registration rights agreement as well as summaries of the terms of our Series D convertible preferred stock and the form of amended and restated rights agreement. We believe that these summaries describe all the material terms of these documents, however, you should read the complete text of each of the transaction agreement, the new shareholder agreement, the new registration rights agreement, the form of designations creating our Series D convertible preferred stock and the form of the amended and restated rights
agreement for their precise legal terms and other information that may be important to you. Copies of these agreements are attached as exhibits to this Form 8-K.
 
Prior to the consummation of the transactions referred to above, our relationship with Westar Energy and its affiliates, including Westar Industries' rights as a ONEOK shareholder with respect to its ONEOK stake, will continue as described under the captions "Description of Capital Stock  Shareholder Rights Agreement," " Preferred Stock," " Shareholder Agreement" and " Registration Rights Agreement" in the prospectus that forms a part of the registration statement on Form S-3 (file No. 102105) initially filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 20, 2002 (the "S-3"). Upon consummation of the transactions referred to above, our relationship with Westar will be modified as described in this report on Form 8-K. Following consummation of these transactions, to the extent there is a conflict between matters described in this report on Form 8-K and matters described in the prospectus filed as a part of the S-3, including as set forth in that prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock," the terms of the relationship and agreements as described in this report on Form 8-K will supersede terms set forth elsewhere.
 
Transaction Agreement
 
The offering; the repurchase
 
We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect an offering of our common stock and other securities, as we may determine, prior to February 28, 2003 if permitted by capital market conditions, as determined by us in our sole discretion. We will use an amount, not to exceed $250,000,000, equal to at least 50% (or such larger percentage as we may, in our sole discretion, determine) of the proceeds of the offering, after deducting underwriters' commissions and discounts and other offering expenses, to repurchase shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries. The price paid for each share of our Series A convertible preferred stock in the repurchase will be equal to the per share offering price for our common stock in the concurrent offering, after taking into account underwriters' commissions and discounts and other offering expenses, as adjusted to reflect ONEOK's 2001 common stock split.
 
Simultaneously with the repurchase, we will modify the terms of the remaining shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock by exchanging newly issued shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock for all the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries that we do not repurchase.
 
.    Westar Industries has agreed that it will not engage in any transactions involving our securities for a period beginning on January 9, 2003 and ending on the later of (x) February 28, 2003 and (y) (i) 90 days from the closing of the repurchase, if the aggregate amount of Series A convertible preferred stock repurchased is less than $200,000,000, or (ii) 180 days from the closing of the repurchase, if the aggregate amount of Series A convertible preferred stock repurchased is equal to or greater than $200,000,000. If we do not complete the offering by February 28, 2003, then the lock-up will expire as of that date.
Lock-up
 
.    Westar Energy and Westar Industries have each agreed to waive any piggy-back registration rights that they have under the current registration rights
Waiver; consent
agreement as well as any dilutive issuance rights that they have under the current shareholder agreement with respect to the offering, so long as the offering and the repurchase are consummated by February 28, 2003.
 
Shelf registration
 
We have agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 within 60 days from the completion of the repurchase and the exchange in order to register for resale all of the shares of our common stock and our Series D convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries as well as all the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of those shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock. In connection with the filing of the shelf registration statement, we have also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause our shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, if permitted by New York Stock Exchange rules, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series D convertible preferred stock, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange prior to any sale, transfer or conversion of the shares our Series D convertible preferred stock held by Westar Industries.
 
Conditions
 
The obligations of Westar Energy, Westar Industries and us to consummate the repurchase and the exchange are subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by law, waiver by the relevant party in its sole discretion) of the following conditions:
 
 
 
 
In addition, the obligations of Westar Energy and Westar Industries to consummate the repurchase and the exchange are subject to the satisfaction (or to the extent permitted under law, waiver by Westar Energy in its sole discretion) of the following conditions:
 
 
 
In addition, the obligations of ONEOK to consummate the repurchase and the exchange are subject to the satisfaction (or to the extent permitted under law, waiver by ONEOK in its sole discretion) of the following conditions:
 
 
Termination
 
The transaction agreement may be terminated:
 
 
 
Shareholder Agreement
 
Although Westar Energy, Westar Industries and ONEOK entered into the new shareholder agreement on January 9, 2003, it will not be effective until the repurchase and exchange are completed, at which time the current shareholder agreement will terminate.
 
Standstill
 
The new shareholder agreement provides, among other things, that Westar Energy, Westar Industries and their affiliates are prohibited from taking various actions, including, without limitation:
 
 
 
 
 
Restrictions on transfer
 
During the term of the new shareholder agreement, Westar Energy, Westar Industries and their affiliates are prohibited, without our prior written consent, from transferring any of our equity securities except:
 
 
 
 
In addition, in the event that a third party commences a tender offer and our rights agreement is inapplicable to that tender offer, Westar Industries may tender a proportionate amount of our equity securities held by it into that tender offer.
 
Voting
 
During the term of the new shareholder agreement, Westar Energy and Westar Industries have agreed to vote, and to cause each of its affiliates to vote, all of our voting securities that they own, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Board Representation
 
Westar Industries will be entitled to designate one director to our board of directors. Westar Industries' designee will not have the right to sit on any committee of our board of directors.
 
Term
 
The new shareholder agreement will terminate if, among other things, Westar Industries' and its affiliates' ownership of our common stock (assuming for this purpose the conversion of the Series D convertible preferred stock into common stock) falls below 10% of all common stock issued and outstanding (again, assuming the conversion of the Series D convertible preferred stock), however, if the shareholder agreement is terminated for that reason, the standstill provisions described above will remain in effect until November 26, 2012.
 
New Registration Rights Agreement
 
Although Westar Energy, Westar Industries and ONEOK entered into the new registration rights agreement on January 9, 2003, it will not be effective until the repurchase and exchange are completed, at which time the current registration rights agreement will terminate.
 
As noted above, we have agreed, subject to the effectiveness of the new registration rights agreement, to keep the shelf registration statement that we will file pursuant to the transaction agreement effective until Westar Industries may freely offer for sale shares of our common stock and our Series D convertible preferred stock without any restriction as to manner of sale and volume imposed by the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Form of Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
 
Under Oklahoma law, every corporation may create and issue rights entitling the holders of those rights to purchase from the corporation shares of its capital stock of any class or classes, subject to any provisions in its certificate of incorporation. The price and terms of the shares must be stated in the certificate of incorporation or in a resolution adopted by the board of directors for the creation or issuance of those rights.
 
Concurrent with the closing of the repurchase and the exchange, we will enter into an amended and restated rights agreement, which will amend and restate our current rights agreement in its entirety. As with most rights agreements, the terms of our new rights agreement are complex and not easily summarized, particularly as they relate to the acquisition of our common stock and to exercisability.
 
Our amended and restated rights agreement will provide that each share of our common stock outstanding as of November 26, 1997 and issued between that date and a date determined pursuant to the new rights agreement, will have one right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock, designated as Series C preferred stock, attached to it, at a purchase price of $40 per one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock, subject to adjustment, as described below.
 
Initially, the rights under our amended and restated rights agreement are attached to outstanding certificates representing our common stock and no separate certificates representing the rights will be distributed. The rights will separate from our common stock and be represented by separate certificates on the earlier of the first date someone acquires beneficial ownership (as defined in the rights agreement) of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, subject to various exceptions, or approximately 10 days after someone commences or indicates an intent to commence a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% of our common stock. The person or group that acquires or indicates an intent to acquire stock as described in the immediately preceding sentence is referred to as an acquiring person.
 
Our amended and restated rights agreement will specifically exclude as an acquiring person, among others, Westar Energy and Westar Industries, but only with respect to shares of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series D convertible preferred stock) beneficially owned by either of them as of the date of the amended and restated rights agreement, less any shares transferred to third parties thereafter.
 
All shares of our common stock issued prior to the date the rights separate from the common stock will be issued with the rights attached. The rights are not exercisable until the date the rights separate from the common stock. The rights will expire on the tenth anniversary of the amended and restated rights agreement, unless we redeem or exchange them at an earlier time or upon the consummation of specified transactions.
 
If a person or group becomes an acquiring person, then each right not owned by that acquiring person or its affiliates, associates or transferees, will entitle its holder to purchase, within specified time periods and at the right's then current purchase price, shares of our common stock (or, in limited circumstances, one one-hundredths of a share of Series C preferred stock) as equals the result obtained by:
 
 
 
If, after a person or group becomes an acquiring person, and:
 
 
 
each right will entitle the holder to purchase, at the right's then current purchase price, shares of common stock of the acquiring company as equal the result obtained by:
 
 
 
We may, at our option, at any time after any person becomes an acquiring person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable rights for our common stock (or shares of our other equity securities, including one one-hundredths of a share of preferred stock, with equivalent rights and privileges as our common stock) at an exchange ratio of one share of our common stock per right, subject to adjustment, until the time that any person, together with its affiliates and associates, has become the beneficial owner of 50% or more of our outstanding common stock.
 
Our board of directors may, at its option, redeem all of the outstanding rights under our amended and restated rights agreement prior to the earlier of (1) the time that an acquiring person obtains 15% or more of our outstanding stock or (2) the final expiration date of the rights. The redemption price under our amended and restated rights agreement is $0.005 per right, subject to adjustment. The right to exercise the rights will terminate upon the action of our board ordering the redemption of the rights and the only right of the holders of the rights will be to receive the redemption price.
 
Holders of rights will have no rights as our stockholders, including the right to vote or receive dividends, simply by virtue of holding the rights.
 
Terms of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
 
Authorized Number of Shares
 
The number of authorized shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock will depend on the number of shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock purchased in the repurchase. Our board of directors intends to authorize a number of shares of Series D convertible preferred stock equal to the total number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the repurchase, less the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of all the shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock purchased in the repurchase.
 
Rank
 
With respect to dividend rights and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of affairs, the Series D convertible preferred stock will rank senior to shares of our common stock, or any class of our equity securities that by its terms is junior to the Series D convertible preferred stock, and will not rank junior with respect to any class or series of preferred stock that we may issue, unless the holders of 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Series D convertible preferred stock consent to the creation of the class or any security
 
convertible into shares of that class or series. We have agreed not to create, authorize or reclassify any authorized stock into any class of capital stock that will rank prior to the Series D convertible preferred stock.
 
Dividends
 
Holders of the shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock will be entitled to receive, when and if declared by our board of directors, quarterly cash dividends in an amount per share equal to $0.23125 If we do not pay dividends on the Series D convertible preferred stock on the dividend payment date for any dividend period, dividends will not be subsequently paid for that dividend period.
 
Liquidation Preference
 
The liquidation preference per share of Series D convertible preferred stock will be equal to the amount payable per share on our common stock, as adjusted appropriately to reflect any stock split or similar events, assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock immediately prior to the event triggering the liquidation preference, plus any dividends then due with respect to the Series D convertible preferred stock.
 
Neither our merger or consolidation into or with one or more other corporations, nor the voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of our property or assets will be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, for the purposes of triggering a liquidation preference, unless that voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer is in connection with a dissolution or winding up of our business.
 
Optional Redemption
 
We will have the option to redeem the Series D convertible preferred stock on or after August 1, 2006 at $20.00 per share if closing price of our common stock has exceeded $25.00 for 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date that we provide notice of our intention to redeem all or a portion of the Series D convertible preferred stock, except that if we deliver a redemption notice and Westar is then precluded under certain provisions of the new registration rights agreement from effecting an underwritten offering, then the redemption date will be extended for 90 days.
 
Conversion Rights
 
Shares of the Series D convertible preferred stock will be convertible at any time, at the holder's option, provided that Westar Energy, Westar Industries and their affiliates may only convert the shares of Series D convertible preferred stock held by them if the aggregate of the regular cash dividends for the most recently completed fiscal year prior to conversion that would have been payable on all the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of one share of Series D convertible preferred stock is greater than $0.925 and such conversion would not subject us or our affiliates to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In addition, Westar Energy, Westar Industries and their affiliates may generally convert any shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock held by them into shares of common stock in connection with transfers made in compliance with the shareholder agreement.
 
We have agreed that we will have at all times reserved and kept available, out of our authorized and unissued stock, shares of our common stock in an amount sufficient for the conversion of all shares of Series D convertible preferred stock then outstanding.
 
Anti-dilution Provisions
 
The number of shares of our common stock into which each share of Series D convertible preferred stock is convertible, the dividend amount payable on each share of Series D convertible preferred stock, and the liquidation preference attached to each share of Series D convertible preferred stock will be subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits or any transaction with comparable effect upon our common stock.
 
Voting Rights
 
Holders of shares of Series D convertible preferred stock will be entitled to vote together with holders of shares of our common stock, as a single class, with respect to any proposed amendment to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws that would reasonably have the effect of modifying in any way the opt out amendment, or would reasonably cause us to become subject to the control share acquisition statute; or any other provisions that are substantially similar to the control share acquisition statute; any proposal relating to the opt out amendment; and any transaction or series of transactions that, if consummated, would constitute a change-in-control (as defined in the certificate of designation of the Series D convertible preferred stock).
 
With respect to those matters, each share of Series D convertible preferred stock will carry a number of votes equal to the number of votes carried by the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of one share of Series D convertible preferred stock.
 
Holders of Series D convertible preferred stock will not be entitled to vote in any election of directors to our board or on any matter submitted to our shareholders other than the foregoing and other than as required by law.
 
A registration statement relating to our common stock and other securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. This shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state.
 
 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission Subpoena
 
On January 9, 2003 we received a subpoena from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") requesting information regarding certain trading by energy and power marketing firms. We intend to respond to the subpoena completely and fully cooperate with the CFTC. Although we are in the early stages of our internal review, we believe that no material adverse effect on us will result from our review and compliance with the subpoena.

(b)    .  (i) Any Holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock desiring to convert such shares into Common Stock shall surrender the certificate(s) evidencing such shares of Series D Preferred Stock of the Holder at the office of the Corporation's transfer agent. Such surrendered certificate(s), if the Corporation shall so require, shall be duly endorsed to the Corporation or in blank, or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer to the Corporation or in blank, and shall be accompanied by written notice to the Corporation that the Holder elects so to convert such shares of Series D Preferred Stock, which notice shall specify the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the Holder wishes the certificate(s) evidencing shares of Common Stock to be issued, in exchange for that certificate or those certificates so surrendered.
Conversion Procedures
 
(ii)    The Corporation shall, within five (5) Business Days after such surrender of certificates evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock accompanied by written notice and in compliance with any other conditions contained herein, issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the person(s) for whose account such certificate(s) evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock were so surrendered, or to the nominee(s) of such Person(s), certificates representing the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such Person shall be entitled pursuant to the then-applicable conversion rate. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made on the date of such surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be converted (the "") and the Person(s) entitled to receive the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Series D Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such Common Stock on such date and thereafter. Conversion of Series D Preferred Stock may otherwise be achieved in accordance with such procedures as the Corporation and a majority of the Holders may agree.
Surrender Date
 
(iii)    In the event that fewer than all shares of Series D Preferred Stock represented by a surrendered certificate are to be converted hereunder, a new certificate shall be issued at the Corporation's expense representing the shares of Series D Preferred Stock not so converted.
 
(iv)    Effective on the day following the Surrender Date, dividends shall cease to accrue on any shares of Series D Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion, such shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding, all rights of the Holders thereof as preferred stockholders of the Corporation shall cease (other than the right to receive dividends declared or otherwise payable to Holders of Series D Preferred Stock on a record date prior to the Surrender Date) and thereupon the certificate(s) theretofore representing shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall represent only the right to receive the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion in respect thereof.
 
(v)     If any shares of Series D Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion subsequent to the record date preceding a Dividend Payment Date but on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date (except shares called for redemption on a redemption date between such record date and such Dividend Payment Date), the Holder of such shares at
the close of business on such record date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares on such Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof.
 
(c)    The conversion rate shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
 
(i)     In case the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, (A) pay a dividend in shares of its Common Stock, (B) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (C) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock which such Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive immediately following such action had such shares of Series D Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8(c)(i) shall become effective retroactively to immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the record date in the case of a dividend and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. If, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8(c)(i), the Holder of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Corporation, the Board of Directors (whose determination shall be conclusive) shall determine the allocation of the adjusted conversion rate between or among shares of such classes of capital stock.
 
(ii)    In case the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue rights or warrants to all holders of shares of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) at a price per share less than the current Market Price per share of Common Stock, at such record date, the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights or warrants by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such current market price. For the purposes of this Section 8(c)(ii), the issuance of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase securities convertible into Common Stock shall be deemed to be the issuance of rights or warrants to purchase the shares of Common Stock into which such securities are convertible at an aggregate offering price equal to the aggregate offering price of such securities plus the minimum aggregate amount (if any) payable upon conversion of such securities into shares of Common Stock; , , that if all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such rights or warrants have not been issued when such rights or warrants expire, then the conversion rate shall promptly be readjusted to the conversion rate which would then be
provided
however
in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants. The foregoing provision shall not apply to issuances of rights pursuant to a stockholder rights plan provided that such rights are issued together with the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8(c)(ii) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants.
 
(iii)    In case the Corporation shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are outstanding, distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or securities or assets (excluding cash dividends payable out of consolidated earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in shares of Common Stock) or rights or warrants to subscribe for securities of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (excluding those referred to in Section 8(c)(ii)), then in each such case the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the conversion rate in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the record date referred to below, and the denominator of which shall be such current market price per share of the Common Stock less the then fair market value of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness or securities or assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.
 
(iv)    The Corporation shall be entitled at its option to make such additional adjustments in the conversion rate, in addition to those required by subsections 8(c)(i), 8(c)(ii) and 8(c)(iii), as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in shares of stock, subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock, issuance of rights or warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than cash dividends payable out of consolidated earnings or retained earnings) referred to above, shall not be taxable to the Holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
 
(v)     In any case in which this Section 8(c) shall require that an adjustment be made retroactively immediately following a record date, the Corporation may elect to defer (but only for five (5) Business Days following the filing of the statement referred to in Section 8(c)(vii)) issuing to the holder of any shares of this Series converted after such record date (A) the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon such conversion over and above (B) the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the conversion rate prior to adjustment.
 
(vi)     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 8(c), the Corporation shall not be required to make any adjustment of the conversion rate (A) in respect of any Special Dividend in which the holders of Series D Preferred Stock participate as provided in Section 2(c) or (B) unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at
least 1% in such rate (any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such rate).
 
(vii)    Whenever an adjustment in the conversion rate is required, the Corporation shall forthwith place on file with its Transfer Agent a statement signed by its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or a Vice President and by its Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer, stating the adjusted conversion rate determined as provided herein. Such statements shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of computing such adjustment. Promptly after the adjustment of the conversion rate, the Corporation shall mail a notice thereof to each holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
 
(d)   .  (i) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized and unissued stock, such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all shares of the Series D Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding, solely for the purpose of effecting such conversion. The Corporation shall, from time to time, in accordance with the laws of the State of Oklahoma, increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at any time the number of shares of authorized and unissued Common Stock shall not be sufficient to permit the conversion of all the then-outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
Reservation of Shares; etc
 
(ii)     If any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved hereunder for purposes of conversion require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any Federal or state law before such shares may be issued upon conversion, the Corporation shall, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, cause such shares to be duly registered or approved as the case may be. If the Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national or foreign securities exchange, the Corporation shall, if permitted by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed on such exchange, upon official notice of issuance, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock.
 
(iii)    The Corporation will pay any and all taxes that may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that in which the shares of Series D Preferred Stock so converted were registered and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issuance has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.
 
(e)   .  In case of (i) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or
Reclassifications, Consolidations, Mergers or Sales of Assets
more other corporations (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock), (iii) any sale or conveyance to another corporation or other entity of all or substantially all of the property of the Corporation, or (iv) any other transaction which would constitute a Change in Control of the Corporation, then the Corporation, or such successor corporation or other entity, as the case may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the holder of each share of Series D Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale, reclassification, change or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series D Preferred Stock might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale, reclassification, change or conveyance, subject to adjustment which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in Section 8(c). The provisions of this paragraph shall apply similarly to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances.
 
9.     .  The Series D Preferred Stock shall be senior in rank, both as to dividends and as to distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, to the Common Stock, or any class of equity securities of the Corporation which by its terms are junior to the Series D Preferred Stock, and shall not be junior in rank with respect to any class or series of Preferred Stock that may be issued by the Corporation, unless the Holders of 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock shall consent to the creation, reclassification or authorization of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock ranking prior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any security convertible into shares of such class or series.

(c).  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 4.6 (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding for which indemnification under Section (a) or (b) above may be requested, such indemnified party shall, without regard to whether a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of, or as contemplated by, this Section 4.6, notify such indemnifying party and the underwriter in writing of the commencement of such action or proceeding; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party in respect of such action or proceeding on account of the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 4.6(a) or 4.6(b) hereof unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party to give such notice, and in no event shall such omission relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability it may have to such indemnified party. In case any such action or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to the indemnified party a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation (unless such indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to the defenses available to such indemnifying party, in which event the indemnified party shall have the right to control its defense and shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party for the expenses incurred in connection with retaining one separate counsel).

(d).  Parent, the Shareholder and the Company agree that if, for any reason, the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 4.6(a) or 4.6(b) hereof are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of, and benefits derived by, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The relative benefit derived by the parties shall be determined by reference to the fact that the Company entered into the Prior Registration Rights Agreement to induce Parent to engage in the transaction in which the Shares were acquired. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.6(d) were determined (i) by pro rata allocation (even if Parent or the Shareholder or any agents for, or underwriters of, the Shares, or all of them, were treated as one entity for such purpose), or (ii) by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 4.6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.6(c) hereof) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

The obligations of the Company under this Section 4.6 shall be in addition to any liability that it may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of Parent and the Shareholder and each agent and underwriter of the Shares and each person, if any, who controls Parent and the Shareholder or any such agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of Parent, the Shareholder and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 4.6, shall be in addition to any liability that Parent, the Shareholder or their respective agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Corporation, any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary of the Corporation or any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Corporation for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of any Person (other than the Corporation, any Subsidiary of the Corporation, any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary of the Corporation or any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Corporation for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) to commence (which intention to commence remains in effect for five Business Days after such announcement), a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any Person becoming an Acquiring Person (including, in the case of both (i) and (ii), any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights), the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date," (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the right to receive Right Certificates will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the underlying Common Shares (including a transfer to the Corporation); provided, however, that if the tender offer is terminated prior to the occurrence of a Distribution Date, then no Distribution Date shall occur as a result of such tender offer. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Corporation will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Corporation will send or cause to be sent by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Corporation, a Right Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a ""), evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held. As of and after the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
Right Certificate
 
(b)    As promptly as practicable following the Record Date, the Corporation will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Preferred Shares, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (the ""), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Corporation. With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof together with a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto. Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with such Common Shares.
Summary of Rights
 
(c)    Certificates for Common Shares which become outstanding (including, without limitation, reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph (c)) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date shall be deemed also to be certificates for Rights and shall bear the following legend:
 
THIS CERTIFICATE ALSO EVIDENCES AND ENTITLES THE HOLDER HEREOF TO CERTAIN RIGHTS AS SET FORTH IN AN AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT BETWEEN ONEOK, INC. AND THE
RIGHTS AGENT, DATED AS OF , 2003 (THE "AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), THE TERMS OF WHICH ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE AND A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF ONEOK, INC. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS SET FORTH IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT, SUCH RIGHTS WILL BE EVIDENCED BY SEPARATE CERTIFICATES AND WILL NO LONGER BE EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. ONEOK, INC. WILL MAIL TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE A COPY OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT WITHOUT CHARGE AFTER RECEIPT OF A WRITTEN REQUEST THEREFOR FROM SUCH HOLDER. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT, RIGHTS ISSUED TO, OR HELD BY, ANY PERSON WHO IS, WAS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR AN AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE THEREOF (AS DEFINED IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED RIGHTS AGREEMENT) AND CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS, WHETHER CURRENTLY HELD BY OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH PERSON OR BY ANY SUBSEQUENT HOLDER, MAY BECOME NULL AND VOID.
                
 
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event that the Corporation purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Shares shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Corporation shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.
 
Section 4.    . (a) The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Corporation may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Section 11 and Section 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share as shall be set forth therein at the price per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share set forth therein (the ""), but the amount and type of securities purchasable upon the exercise of each Right and the Purchase Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.

Purchase Price
 
(b)    Any Right Certificate issued pursuant to Section 3(a) or Section 22 hereof that represents Rights which are null and void pursuant to Section 7(e) of this Agreement and any Right Certificate issued pursuant to Section 6 or Section 11 hereof upon transfer, exchange,
 
replacement or adjustment of any other Right Certificate referred to in this sentence, shall contain (to the extent feasible) the following legend:
 
THE RIGHTS REPRESENTED BY THIS RIGHT CERTIFICATE ARE OR WERE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY A PERSON WHO WAS OR BECAME AN ACQUIRING PERSON OR AN AFFILIATE OR ASSOCIATE OF AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT). ACCORDINGLY, THIS RIGHT CERTIFICATE AND THE RIGHTS REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE NULL AND VOID.
 
Provisions of Section 7(e) of this Rights Agreement shall be operative whether or not the foregoing legend is contained on any such Right Certificate.
 
Section 5.    .  The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Corporation by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, any of its Vice Presidents, or its Treasurer, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Corporation's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. In case any officer of the Corporation who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Corporation before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Corporation, such Right Certificates may nevertheless be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Corporation with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Corporation; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Corporation by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Corporation to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such person was not such an officer.
Countersignature and Registration
 
Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its office designated as the appropriate place for surrender of such Right Certificate for transfer, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the certificate number and the date of each of the Right Certificates.
 
Section 6.    .  Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b), Section 7(e) and Section 14 hereof, at any time after the close of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (or, following a Triggering Event, other securities, as the case may be) as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder (or former holder in the case of a transfer) to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange
Transfer, Split-Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificate
 
any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose. Neither the Rights Agent nor the Corporation shall be obligated to take any action whatsoever with respect to the transfer of any such surrendered Right Certificate until the registered holder shall have completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of assignment on the reverse side of such Right Certificate and shall have provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Corporation shall reasonably request. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 4(b), Section 7(e) and Section 14 hereof, countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Corporation or the Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split-up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
 
Upon receipt by the Corporation and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Corporation's request, reimbursement to the Corporation and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Corporation will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for countersignature and delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
 
Section 7.    .  (a) Subject to Section 7(e) hereof, the
Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights
registered holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase and the certificate on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the total number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (or other securities, as the case may be) as to which such surrendered Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on [            ], 2013 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption Date"), (iii) the time at which the Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof, or (iv) the consummation of a transaction contemplated by Section 13(d) hereof.
 
(b)    The Purchase Price for each one-hundredth of a Preferred Share pursuant to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $40.00, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the next sentence and in Sections 11 and 13(a) hereof and shall be payable in accordance with paragraph (c) below. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date, the Corporation shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in any such case, each Common
 
Share outstanding following such subdivision, combination or consolidation shall continue to have one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) associated therewith and the Purchase Price following any such event shall be proportionately adjusted to equal the result obtained by multiplying the Purchase Price immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event. The adjustment provided for in the preceding sentence shall be made successively whenever such a dividend is declared or paid or such a subdivision, combination or consolidation is effected.
 
(c)    Upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase and the certificate duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for the Preferred Shares (or other securities, as the case may be) to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 6 hereof by certified check, cashier's check or money order payable to the order of the Corporation, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any transfer agent of the Preferred Shares certificates for the number of Preferred Shares to be purchased and the Corporation hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests, or (B) requisition from the depositary agent (if the Corporation, in its sole discretion, shall have elected to deposit the Preferred Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights hereunder into a depositary) depositary receipts representing such number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share as are to be purchased (in which case certificates for the Preferred Shares represented by such receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary agent) and the Corporation will direct the depositary agent to comply with such requests, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Corporation the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder, and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt thereof, deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate. In the event that the Corporation is obligated to issue other securities (including Common Shares) of the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Corporation will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.
 
In addition, in the case of an exercise of the Rights by a holder pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii), the Rights Agent shall return such Right Certificate to the registered holder thereof after imprinting, stamping or otherwise indicating thereon that the rights represented by such Right Certificate no longer include the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii) of the Rights Agreement and if less than all the Rights represented by such Right Certificate were so exercised, the Rights Agent shall indicate on the Right Certificate the number of Rights represented thereby which continue to include the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii).
 
(d)    In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14
 
hereof, or the Rights Agent shall place an appropriate notation on the Right Certificate with respect to those Rights exercised.
 
(e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, any Rights beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person, (ii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any Affiliate or Associate thereof) who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any Affiliate or Associate thereof) who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in such Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has a continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the Corporation has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this Section 7(e), shall become null and void without any further action and no holder of such Rights shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights, whether under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise. The Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to insure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b) hereof are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.
 
(f)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Corporation shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such exercise, and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Corporation shall reasonably request.
 
Section 8.    .  All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise (other than a partial exercise), transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Corporation or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Corporation shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Corporation otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall destroy such canceled Right Certificates in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Corporation.
Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates
 
Section 9.    .  The Corporation covenants and agrees that at all times prior to the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Preferred Shares, or any authorized and issued Preferred Shares held in its treasury, the number of Preferred Shares
Reservation and Availability of Capital Stock
 
that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights and, after the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, so reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Common Shares (and/or other securities) which may be required to permit the exercise in full of the Rights pursuant to this Agreement.
 
So long as the Preferred Shares (and, after the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, Common Shares, or any other securities, as the case may be) issuable upon the exercise of the Rights may be listed on any national securities exchange, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
 
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares or other securities (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and non-assessable shares or securities.
 
The Corporation further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) upon the exercise of Rights. The Corporation shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise, or to issue or to deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) upon the exercise of any Rights, until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Corporation's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
 
The Corporation shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the Shares Acquisition Date (or, if required by law, at such earlier time following the Distribution Date as so required), a registration statement under the Act, with respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) until the date of the expiration of the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii). The Corporation will also take such action as may be appropriate under the blue sky laws of the various states.
 
Section 10.    .  Each Person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right
Preferred Shares Record Date
 
Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided, however, that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) transfer books of the Corporation are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be) transfer books of the Corporation are open.
 
Section 11.    .  The Purchase Price, the number and kind of shares or other securities covered by each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number and Kind of Shares or Number of Rights
 
(a)    (i) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Preferred Shares into a smaller number of Preferred Shares or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and Section 7(e) hereof, the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Corporation were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
 
(ii)    In the event any Person, alone or together with its Affiliates and Associates, shall become an Acquiring Person, then proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right (except as provided below and in Section 7(e) hereof) shall, for a period of 60 days after the later of (i) the occurrence of any such event or (ii) the effective date of an appropriate registration statement under the Act pursuant to Section 9 hereof, have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such number of Common Shares (or, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, one one- hundredths of a Preferred Share) as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the then number of one one- hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event and (y) dividing that product by 50% of the then current per share market price of the Corporation's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the
 
date of such first occurrence (such number of shares being referred to as the ""); provided, however, that if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is also subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii).

Shares
 
(iii)    In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued (and unreserved) Common Shares to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) and the Rights become so exercisable (and the Board has determined to make the Rights exercisable into fractions of a Preferred Share), notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent necessary and permitted by applicable law, each Right shall thereafter represent the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (x) a number of (or fractions of) Common Shares (up to the maximum number of Common Shares which may permissibly be issued) and (y) one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share or a number of (or fractions of) other equity securities of the Corporation (or, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, debt) which the Board of Directors of the Corporation has determined to have the same aggregate current market value (determined pursuant to Sections 11(d)(i) and (ii) hereof, to the extent applicable) as one Common Share (such number of (or fractions of) Preferred Shares (or other equity securities or debt of the Corporation) being referred to as a ""), equal in the aggregate to the number of Adjustment Shares; provided, however, if sufficient Common Shares and/or capital stock equivalents are unavailable, then the Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares or capital stock equivalents for issuance upon exercise of the Rights, including the calling of a meeting of stockholders; and provided, further, that if the Corporation is unable to cause sufficient Common Shares and/or capital stock equivalents to be available for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, then each Right shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Adjusted Number of Shares upon exercise at the Adjusted Purchase Price (as such terms are hereinafter defined). As used herein, the term "" shall be equal to that number of (or fractions of) Common Shares (and/or capital stock equivalents) equal to the product of (x) the number of Adjustment Shares and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares (and/or capital stock equivalents) available for issuance upon exercise of the Rights and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Adjustment Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise in full of all Rights (assuming there were a sufficient number of Common Shares available) (such fraction being referred to as the ""). The "" shall mean the product of the Purchase Price and the Proration Factor. The Board of Directors may, but shall not be required to, establish procedures to allocate the right to receive Common Shares and capital stock equivalents upon exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights.

(b)    In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights (other than the Rights), options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares (or shares having the same rights and privileges as the Preferred Shares
("") or securities convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares at a price per Preferred Share or equivalent preferred share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares) less than the then current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Preferred Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current per share market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent. Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
equivalent preferred shares
 
(c)    In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Preferred Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Preferred Shares on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Preferred Share and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Preferred Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(d)    (i) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "" of any security (a "" for the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security and prior to the expiration of thirty (30) Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the- counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System ("") or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Security, the fair value of the Security on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be used. The term "" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day. Subject to Section 11(d)(ii), if any Security is not publicly held or so listed or traded, "current per share market price" of such Security shall mean the fair market value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent.

(ii)    For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Shares are not publicly traded, the current per share market price of the Preferred Shares shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Shares as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof), multiplied by one hundred. If neither the Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or so listed or traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be
described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent.
 
(e)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one one-hundredth-thousandth of a Preferred Share or one ten-thousandth of any other share or security, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three (3) years from the date of the transaction which mandates such adjustment or (ii) the Final Expiration Date.
 
(f)    If, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than Preferred Shares, thereafter the number of other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Shares contained in Sections 11(a) through (c), inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Preferred Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
 
(g)    All Rights originally issued by the Corporation subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one-hundredths of a Preferred Share purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
 
(h)    Unless the Corporation shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (calculated to the nearest one one-hundredth thousandths of a Preferred Share) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of Preferred Shares covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment of the Purchase Price by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
 
(i)    The Corporation may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in lieu of any adjustment in the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-
 
thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Corporation shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Corporation shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Corporation, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Corporation, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
 
(j)    Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
 
(k)    Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share, Common Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Corporation shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue such number of fully paid and nonassessable one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share, Common Shares or other securities at such adjusted Purchase Price.
 
(l)    In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Corporation may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the Preferred Shares, Common Shares or other securities of the Corporation, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Preferred Shares, Common Shares or other securities of the Corporation, if any, issuable upon exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
 
(m)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11 to the contrary, the Corporation shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any (i) consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred
Shares, (ii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares at less than the current market price, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Shares, (iv) stock dividends or (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Corporation to holders of its Preferred Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
 
(n)    The Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Distribution Date, (i) consolidate with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Corporation in a transaction which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), (ii) merge with or into any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Corporation in a transaction which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), or (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), if (x) at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer there are any charter or by-law provisions or any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect or other actions taken, which would materially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights or (y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale, the stockholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal Party" for purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates. The Corporation shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless prior thereto the Corporation and such other Person shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement evidencing compliance with this Section 11(n).
 
(o)    The Corporation covenants and agrees that, after the Distribution Date, it will not, except as permitted by Section 23 or Section 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action the purpose of which is to, or if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that the effect of such action is to, materially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
 
(p)    The exercise of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) shall only result in the reduction of rights under Section 11(a)(ii) to the extent so exercised and shall not otherwise affect the rights represented by the Rights under this Rights Agreement, including the rights represented by Section 13.
 
Section 12.    .  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 or 13 hereof, the Corporation shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 26 hereof. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

Section 13.    .  (a) In the event that, on or following the Shares Acquisition Date, directly or indirectly, (x) the Corporation shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any Interested Stockholder or, if in such merger or consolidation all holders of Common Shares are not treated alike, any other Person, (y) the Corporation shall consolidate with, or merge with, any Interested Stockholder or, if in such merger or consolidation all holders of Common Shares are not treated alike, any other Person, and the Corporation shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger (other than, in a case of any transaction described in (x) or (y), a merger or consolidation which would result in all of the securities generally entitled to vote in the election of directors ("") of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into securities of the surviving entity) all of the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and the holders (and relative percentage holdings of each such holder) of such securities not having changed as a result of such merger or consolidation), or (z) the Corporation shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any Interested Stockholder or Persons or, if in such transaction all holders of Common Shares are not treated alike, any other Person (other than the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation in one or more transactions each of which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), then, and in each such case (except as provided in Section 13(d) hereof), proper provision shall be made so that (i) each holder of a Right, except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof, shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of freely tradable Common Shares of the Principal Party (as hereinafter defined), not subject to any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall equal the result obtained by (A) multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable (without taking into account any adjustment previously made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) and dividing that product by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Common Shares of such Principal Party (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such Section 13 Event; (ii) such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Section 13 Event, all the obligations and duties of the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) the term "Corporation" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party; it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section 11 hereof shall apply only to such Principal Party following the first occurrence of a Section 13 Event; and (iv) such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares) in connection with the consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights.

(ii)    in the case of any transaction described in clause (z) of the first sentence of Section 13(a), the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions; provided, however, that in any of the foregoing cases, (1) if the Common Shares of such Person are not at such time and have not been continuously over the preceding twelve (12) month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common Shares of which are and have been so registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person; (2) in case such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Shares of two or more of which are and have been so registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of the Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market value; and (3) in case such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Person, the rules set forth in (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the chains of ownership having an interest in such joint venture as if such party were a "Subsidiary" of both or all of such joint venturers and the Principal Parties in each such chain shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as their direct or indirect interests in such Person bear to the total of such interests.
 
(c)    The Corporation shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless the Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of its authorized Common Shares which have not been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Corporation and such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing for the terms set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 13 and further providing that, as soon as practicable after the date of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer mentioned in paragraph (a) of this Section 13, the Principal Party at its own expense shall:

Upon consummation of any such transaction contemplated by this Section 13(d), all Rights hereunder shall expire.

In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be used.
Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
 
(b)    The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are one one-hundredths or integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are one one-hundredths or integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share). Fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share may, at the election of the corporation, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Corporation and a depositary selected by it; provided that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have the rights, privileges and preferences to which
 
they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not one one-hundredth or integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, the Corporation shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be the closing price of a Preferred Share (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
 
(c)     Following the occurrence of one of the transactions or events specified in Section 11 giving rise to the right to receive Common Shares, capital stock equivalents (other than Preferred Shares) or other securities upon the exercise of a Right, the Corporation shall not be required to issue fractions of shares or units of such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or other securities upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractions of such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or other securities. In lieu of fractional shares or units of such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or other securities, the Corporation may pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a share or unit of such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or other securities. For purposes of this Section 14(c), the current market value shall be determined in the manner set forth in Section 11(d) hereof for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise and, if such capital stock equivalent is not traded, each such capital stock equivalent shall have the value of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share.
 
(d)     The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional share upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).
 
Section 15.     . All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Corporation to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to, this Agreement.

(b)     after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer and with the appropriate form fully executed;
 
(c)     subject to Section 6 and Section 7(f) hereof, the Corporation and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered in the records of the Corporation as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificate or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Corporation or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Corporation nor the Rights Agent, subject to the last sentence of Section 7(e) hereof, shall be required to be affected by any notice to the contrary; and
 
(d)     notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Corporation nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or a beneficial interest in a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided, however, the Corporation must use its best efforts to have any such order, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.
 
Section 17.    . No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Shares or any other securities of the Corporation which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Corporation or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.

In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of a predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates in its name as the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.

In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
 
Section 20.     .

(e)    The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Corporation of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any adjustment required under the provisions of Section 11 or Section 13 hereof or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of the certificate described in Section 12 hereof); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares or Common Shares or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares or Common Shares or other securities will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f)    The Corporation agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
(g)    The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Corporation, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Corporation may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in
writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any officer of the Corporation actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instruction in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
 
(h)    The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Corporation or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Corporation may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Corporation or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Corporation or for any other legal entity.
 
(i)     The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Corporation resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
 
(j)     No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(k)     If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has not been completed, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise of transfer without receiving written instructions from the Corporation.
 
(l)     The Rights Agent shall have no responsibility to the Company, any holders of Rights, any holders of Common Stock or any holders of Preferred Stock for interest or earnings on any monies held by the Rights Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(m)     The Rights Agent shall not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any fact, event or determination (including, without limitation, any dates or events defined in this Agreement or the designation of any Person as an Acquiring Person, Affiliate or Associate) under this Agreement unless and until the Rights Agent shall be specifically notified in writing by the Company of such fact, event or determination, and all notices shall be effective if given in accordance with Section 26 hereof, and in the absence of such notice the Rights Agent may conclusively assume that no such event or condition exists.
 
Section 21.     . The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing mailed to the Corporation and to each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Corporation may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon sixty (60) days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and to holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Corporation shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Corporation shall fail to make such appointment within a period of sixty (60) days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Corporation), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate or the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Corporation or by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 (or such lower number as approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors). After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed and the duties and obligations of the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent shall cease and terminate; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Corporation shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Change of Rights Agent
 
Section 22.     . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Corporation may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Issuance of New Right Certificates
 
In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to the earliest of the Redemption Date, the Final Expiration Date and the consummation of a transaction contemplated by Section 13(d) hereof, the Corporation (a) shall with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
securities, notes or debentures issued by the Corporation, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; provided, however, that no Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.
 
Section 23.    . (a)   (i) The Board of Directors of the Corporation may, at its option, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.005 per Right, as such amount may be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the ""), at any time prior to the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, or (y) the Final Expiration Date, and the Corporation may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price either in Common Shares (based on the current per share market price, as defined in Section 11(d) hereof, of the Common Shares at the time of redemption) or cash; provided, however, that if the Corporation elects to pay the Redemption Price in Common Shares, the Corporation shall not be required to issue any fractional Common Shares and the number of Common Shares issuable to each holder of Rights shall be rounded down to the next whole share.
Redemption and Termination
Redemption Price
 
(ii)    In addition, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may, at its option, at any time following a Shares Acquisition Date but prior to any Section 13 Event, redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price in connection with any Section 13 Event in which all holders of Common Shares are treated alike and not involving (other than as a holder of Common Shares being treated like all other such holders) a Transaction Person.
 
(b)    In the case of a redemption permitted under Section 23(a)(i), immediately upon the date for redemption set forth (or determined in the manner specified in) in a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation ordering the redemption of the Rights, evidence of which shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price for each Right so held. In the case of a redemption permitted only under Section 23(a)(ii), evidence of which shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price upon the later of ten Business Days following the giving of notice or the expiration of any period during which the rights under Section 11(a)(ii) may be exercised. The Corporation shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within ten (10) days after such date for redemption set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Corporation shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Corporation nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically
set forth in this Section 23 and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.
 
(c)    In the case of a redemption permitted under Section 23(a)(i), the Corporation may, at its option, discharge all of its obligations with respect to the Rights by (i) issuing a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the Rights in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) mailing payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the Transfer Agent of the Common Shares, and upon such action, all outstanding Rights and Right Certificates shall be null and void without any further action by the Corporation.
 
Section 21.    . (a) The Board of Directors of the Corporation may, at its option, at any time after the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares of the Corporation at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction involving either the Common Shares or the Preferred Shares occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Corporation, any Subsidiary of the Corporation, any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any such Subsidiary, any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of such a plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
Exchange
Exchange Ratio
 
(b)     Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Corporation ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Corporation shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Corporation promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
 
(c)    In any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Corporation, at its option, may substitute Preferred Shares (or equivalent preferred shares, as such term is defined in Section 11(b) hereof) for some or all of the Common Shares exchangeable for Rights, at the
initial rate of one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (or equivalent preferred share) for each Common Share, as appropriately adjusted to reflect adjustments in the voting rights of the Preferred Shares pursuant to the terms thereof, so that the fraction of a Preferred Share delivered in lieu of each Common Share shall have the same voting rights as one Common Share.
 
(d)    The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall not authorize any exchange transaction referred to in Section 24(a) hereof unless at the time such exchange is authorized there shall be sufficient Common Shares or Preferred Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit the exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24.
 
Section 25.    . (a) In case the Corporation shall propose (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Preferred Shares (other than a regularly quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Preferred Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Preferred Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Preferred Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Corporation in a transaction which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer) in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of which does not violate Section 11(o) hereof), or (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, then, in each such case, the Corporation shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action to the extent feasible and file a certificate with the Rights Agent to that effect, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Preferred Shares, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Preferred Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the Preferred Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.
Notice of Certain Events
 
(b)    In case of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, then (i) the Corporation shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and (ii) all references in the preceding paragraph (a) to Preferred Shares shall be deemed thereafter to refer also, if appropriate, to Common Shares and/or, if appropriate, other securities of the Corporation.

Prior to the Distribution Date, the Corporation and the Rights Agent shall, if the Corporation so directs, supplement or amend any provision of this Agreement without the approval of any holders of certificates representing Common Shares. From and after the Distribution Date, the Corporation and the Rights Agent shall, if the Corporation so directs, supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates in order (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, (iii) to shorten or lengthen any time period hereunder or (iv) to change or supplement the provisions hereunder in any manner which the Corporation may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Right Certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person); provided, however, that this Agreement may not be supplemented or amended to lengthen, pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence, (A) a time period relating to when the Rights may be redeemed at such time as the Rights are not then redeemable, or (B) any other time period unless such lengthening is for the purpose of protecting, enhancing or clarifying the rights of, and/or the benefits to, the holders of Rights. Upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Corporation which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of this Section 27, the Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment, provided that such supplement or amendment does not adversely affect the rights or obligations of the Rights Agent under Section 18 or Section 20 of this Agreement.

Exhibit A
 
 
 
Not exercisable after [, 2013], or earlier if redeemed by the corporation. The rights are subject to redemption at $.01 per right on the terms set forth in the rights agreement.
                    
 
Under certain circumstances set forth in the rights agreement, rights issued to, or held by, any person who is, was or becomes an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate thereof (as defined in the rights agreement) and certain related persons, whether currently held by or on behalf of such person or by any subsequent holder, shall become null and void.
 
 
 
This certifies that                                     , or registered assigns, is the registered owner of the number of Rights set forth above, each of which entitles the owner thereof, subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of , 2003 (the "Rights Agreement"), between ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Corporation"), and UMB Bank, N.A. (the "Rights Agent"), to purchase from the Corporation at any time after the Distribution Date (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) and prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on [, 2013], unless the Rights evidenced hereby shall have been previously redeemed by the Corporation, at the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, or at the office of its successor as Rights Agent, one one-hundredth of a fully paid non-assessable share of Series C Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Corporation, at a purchase price of $40.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), upon presentation and surrender of this Right Certificate with the Form of Election to Purchase duly executed. The number of Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate (and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share which may be purchased upon exercise hereof) set forth above, and the Purchase Price set forth above, are the number and Purchase Price as of                         , 2003 based on the Preferred Shares as constituted at such date.
                    
                    
 
Upon the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement), if the Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate are beneficially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of any such Acquiring Person (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), (ii) a transferee of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (iii) under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement, a transferee of any such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such, such Rights shall become null and void and no holder hereof shall have any right with respect to such Rights from and after the occurrence of such Section 11(a)(ii) Event.
 
As provided in the Rights Agreement, the Purchase Price and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share or other securities which may be purchased upon the exercise of the Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate are subject to modification and adjustment upon the happening of certain events, including Triggering Events (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement).
 
This Right Certificate is subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the Rights Agreement, which terms, provisions and conditions are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof and to which Rights Agreement reference is hereby made for a full description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities hereunder of the Rights Agent, the Corporation and the holders of the Right Certificates, which limitations of rights include the temporary suspension of the exercisability of such Rights under the specific circumstances set forth in the Rights Agreement. Copies of the Rights Agreement are on file at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and the principal office or offices of the Rights Agent.
 
This Right Certificate, with or without other Right Certificates, upon surrender at the principal office of the Rights Agent, may be exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates of like tenor and date evidencing Rights entitling the holder to purchase a like aggregate number of Preferred Shares or other securities as the Rights evidenced by the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered shall have entitled such holder to purchase. If this Right Certificate shall be exercised in part, the holder shall be entitled to receive upon surrender hereof another Right Certificate or Right Certificates for the number of whole Rights not exercised.
 
Subject to the provisions of the Rights Agreement, the Rights evidenced by this Certificate may be redeemed by the Corporation at a redemption price of $.01 per Right (subject to adjustment as provided in the Rights Agreement) payable in Common Shares or cash.
 
The Corporation shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right as defined in the Rights Agreement.
 
The Corporation will not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are one one-hundredths or integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are one one-hundredths or integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share). In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares other than fractions that are multiples of one one-hundredth of a Share, the Corporation will pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share as defined in the Rights Agreement.
 
No holder of this Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Shares or of any other securities of the
 
Corporation which may at any time be issuable on the exercise hereof, nor shall anything contained in the Rights Agreement or herein be construed to confer upon the holder hereof, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Corporation or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in the Rights Agreement), or to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate shall have been exercised as provided in the Rights Agreement.
 
This Right Certificate shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until it shall have been countersigned by the Rights Agent.
 
WITNESS the signature of the proper officers of the Corporation and its corporate seal. Dated as of                      , [2003].

The undersigned hereby certifies that (1) the Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate are not being exercised by or on behalf of a Person who is or was an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) and (2) after due inquiry and to the best knowledge of the undersigned, the undersigned did not acquire the Rights evidenced by this Rights Certificate from any Person who is or was an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement).

The signature on the foregoing Forms of Assignment and Election and certificates must conform to the name as written upon the face of this Right Certificate in every particular, without alteration or enlargement or any change whatsoever.
 
In the event the certification set forth above in the Form of Assignment or the Form of Election to Purchase, as the case may be, is not completed, the Corporation and the Rights Agent will deem the Beneficial Owner of the Rights evidenced by this Right Certificate to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) and such Assignment or Election to Purchase will not be honored.
Exhibit B
 
 
Under certain circumstances set forth in the rights agreement, rights issued to, or held by, any person who is, was or becomes an acquiring person or an affiliate or associate thereof (as defined in the rights agreement) and certain related persons, whether currently held by or on behalf of such person or by any subsequent holder, shall become null and void.
 
On November 26, 1997, the Board of Directors of ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Corporation"), declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Corporation. The dividend is payable to the stockholders of record as of 5:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, on November 26, 1997 (the "Record Date"), and with respect to Common Shares issued thereafter until the Distribution Date (as defined below) and, in certain circumstances, with respect to Common Shares issued after the Distribution Date. Except as set forth below, each Right, when it becomes exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Corporation one one-hundredth of a share of Series C Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares") at a price of $80.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of , 2003 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Corporation and UMB Bank, N.A. (the "Rights Agent").
                
 
Initially, the Rights will be attached to all certificates representing Common Shares then outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates (as hereinafter defined) will be distributed. The Rights will separate from the Common Shares on the earliest to occur of (i) the first date of public announcement that a person or "group" has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (except pursuant to a Permitted Offer, as hereinafter defined); or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as the Board may determine) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person (as hereinafter defined) (the earliest of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"). A person or group whose acquisition of Common Shares causes a Distribution Date pursuant to clause (i) above is an "Acquiring Person." The first date of public announcement that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person is the "Shares Acquisition Date." "Disinterested Directors" are directors who are not officers of the Corporation and who are not Acquiring Persons or their affiliates, associates or representatives of any of them, or any Person who directly or indirectly proposed or nominated as a director of the Corporation by a Transaction Person (as defined below).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquiring Person does not include (i) Westar Energy, Inc. and Westar Industries, Inc., but only with respect to Common Shares beneficially owned by them as of the date of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, less any Common Shares beneficially owned by them that are transferred or sold after the date of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement.
 
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights) new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date (and to each initial record holder of certain Common Shares issued after the Distribution Date), and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
 
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on, [, 2013], unless earlier redeemed by the Corporation as described below.
                    
 
In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person (except pursuant to a Permitted Offer as defined below), each holder of a Right will have (subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement) the right (the "Flip-In Right") to receive upon exercise the number of Common Shares, or, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (or, in certain circumstances, other securities of the Corporation) having a value (immediately prior to such triggering event) equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of the event described above, all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate thereof will be null and void. A "Permitted Offer" is a tender or exchange offer for all outstanding Common Shares which is at a price and on terms determined, prior to the purchase of shares under such tender or exchange offer, by a Majority of Disinterested Directors to be adequate (taking into account all factors that such Disinterested Directors deem relevant) and otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation, its stockholders and its other relevant constituencies (other than the person or any affiliate or associate thereof on whose basis the offer is being made) taking into account all factors that such directors may deem relevant and (ii) any tender or exchange offer required or permitted to be made by the Shareholder Group (as defined in the Shareholder Agreement) pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Shareholder Agreement).
 
In the event that, at any time following the Shares Acquisition Date, (i) the Corporation is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the holders of all of the outstanding Common Shares immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction are not the holders of all of the surviving corporation's voting power, or (ii) more than 50% of the Corporation's assets or earning power is sold or transferred, in either case with or to an Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate or any other person in which such Acquiring Person, affiliate or associate has an interest or any person acting on behalf of or in concert with such Acquiring Person, affiliate or associate, or, if in such transaction all holders of Common Shares are not treated alike, any other person, then each holder of a Right (except Rights which previously have been voided as set forth above) shall thereafter have the right (the
"Flip-Over Right") to receive, upon exercise, common shares of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of one-hundredths of a Preferred Share or other securities issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Preferred Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
The Purchase Price is also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Shares or a stock dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional one-hundredths of a Preferred Share will be issued and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day price to the date of exercise.
 
Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share but, if greater, will be entitled to an aggregate dividend per share of 100 times the dividend declared per Common Share. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1.00 per share; thereafter, and after the holders of the Common Shares receive a liquidation payment of $0.01 per share, the holders of the Preferred Shares and the holders of the Common Shares will share the remaining assets in the ratio of one hundred to 1 (as adjusted) for each Preferred Share and Common Share so held, respectively. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive one hundred times the amount received per Common Share. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions. In the event that the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Shares is equivalent to at least six full quarterly dividends, the holders of the Preferred Shares shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect two directors in addition to the directors elected by the holders of the Common Shares until all cumulative dividends on the Preferred Shares have been paid through the last quarterly dividend payment date or until non-cumulative dividends have been paid regularly for at least one year.
 
At any time prior to the earlier to occur of (i) a person becoming an Acquiring Person or (ii) the expiration of the Rights, the Corporation may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price"), which redemption shall be effective upon the action of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Corporation may redeem the then outstanding Rights in whole but not in part, at the Redemption Price after the triggering
of the Flip-in Right and before the expiration of any period during which the Flip-in Right may be exercised in connection with a merger or other business combination transaction or series of transactions involving the Corporation in which all holders of Common Shares are treated alike but not involving a Transaction Person (as defined below). Upon the effective date of the redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Corporation, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to stockholders of the Corporation, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income should the Rights become exercisable or upon the occurrence of certain events thereafter.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Westar Energy, Inc. (NYSE:WR) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., to repurchase a portion of the shares of ONEOK's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by Westar at the prevailing market price, less certain costs and to exchange Westar's remaining shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for new shares of ONEOK's Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The repurchase and related transactions are subject to approval by the Kansas Corporation Commission and other conditions, including the receipt by ONEOK of the proceeds from future equity or other financing transactions.
 
David Kyle, ONEOK's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "This agreement removes the uncertainty regarding Westar's ownership position in ONEOK. It represents the positive efforts on the part of the new leadership team at Westar and in particular their President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Haines. Together we have crafted an agreement that creates a win-win situation that addresses our needs and theirs. We believe that this transaction will ultimately have the effect of increasing our market capitalization and eliminating the use of an accounting pronouncement (EITF Topic No. D-95) that has impacted our earnings calculation resulting in a lower reported earnings per share.
 
"This action along with our recent acquisition of the Texas Gas Service Company, the third largest gas distribution company in Texas, and the divestitures of natural gas midstream assets and reserves allows us to move with greater confidence into 2003."
 
ONEOK has agreed to file a shelf registration statement, following completion of the repurchase and the exchange, to register for resale all the Series D Convertible Preferred shares
held by Westar and 4.7 million shares of ONEOK common currently held by Westar. The timing of sales of the Westar stock will be governed by a new Registration Rights Agreement entered into between ONEOK and Westar.
 
The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will have substantially the same terms as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, except that:
 
 
 
 
 
ONEOK and Westar Energy have also agreed to amend the terms of their existing Shareholder Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement. The new agreements will not be effective until the repurchase and the exchange are completed. Under the new agreements:
 
 
 
 
 
 
ONEOK, Inc., is a diversified energy company involved primarily in oil and gas production, natural gas processing, gathering, storage and transmission in the mid-continent areas of the United States.

The company is the largest natural gas distributor in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas, operating as Kansas Gas Service, Oklahoma Natural Gas and Texas Gas Service, serving 1.9 million customers. ONEOK is a Fortune 500 company.
