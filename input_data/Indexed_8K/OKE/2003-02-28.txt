On February 27, 2003, ONEOK, Inc. (the "Company") announced earnings guidance for 2003 of $2.40 to $2.45 per share of common stock, excluding the effect of the EITF 02-3 accounting change. EITF 02-3 requires certain energy-related contracts, which have been accounted for at fair value, to be accounted for on an accrual basis. This will result in going from mark-to-market accounting to accrual accounting. The impact of EITF 02-3 will require a pre-tax charge of $231 million in the first quarter of 2003. In addition, the effect of EITF Topic D-95 was eliminated beginning in February 2003 by the implementation of a new shareholder agreement with Westar Energy. The Company will be required to calculate earnings under Topic D-95 only for the first month of 2003. The remaining 11 months will be calculated under the traditional dilutive earnings calculation method.

99.1 Press release issued by ONEOK, Inc. dated February 27, 2003.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 ONEOK, Inc., (NYSE:OKE) today announced earnings guidance for 2003. David Kyle, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK, said, "As we enter 2003, ONEOK is in the unique position of trying to communicate earnings guidance for the year through the use of two very complicated accounting rules. We hope we can reduce the confusion and concern about the impact of these rules on our 2003 earnings."

This week, ONEOK reported earnings of $1.39 per common share for fiscal year 2002. These earnings were calculated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-95 that, in effect, reduced earnings by 27 cents per share for the year.
 
The effect of this rule on ONEOK was eliminated beginning in February of 2003 by the implementation of a new shareholder agreement with Westar Energy. ONEOK will be required by this rule to calculate earnings only for the first month of 2003 under EITF D-95. The remaining 11 months will be calculated under the traditional dilutive earnings calculation method.
 
ONEOK must also implement EITF 02-3, which requires certain energy-related contracts, which had been accounted for at fair value, to be accounted for on an accrual basis. This will result in going from mark-to-market accounting to accrual accounting. The impact of EITF 02-3 will require a pre-tax charge of $231 million.
 
"After further review following today's 2002 earnings conference call, it has been determined that the initial earnings guidance for 2003 given today ranging from $2.20 to $2.30 per common share, excluding the
 
effect of the EITF 02-3 accounting change, was too conservative. The new earnings range for 2003 is $2.40 to $2.45 per share of common stock also excluding the change," Kyle said.
 
Tables on the following pages should provide some assistance in understanding how EITF 02-3 will impact earnings. The first table shows the impact by category and year. The second table compares fiscal year 2002 with 2003 eliminating non-recurring items and showing the impact of EITF 02-3 in 2003.
