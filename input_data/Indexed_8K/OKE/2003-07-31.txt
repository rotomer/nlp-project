Second quarter business unit results:
 
Production
 
Second quarter operating income increased to $3.2 million from $2.1 million for the same quarter last year because of:
 
 
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma. Approximately two-thirds of the segment's reserves were sold in the first quarter of 2003. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Second quarter operating income increased significantly to $15.8 million, compared with $28,000 for the same quarter last year because of:
 
 
 
 
The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 2 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.2 Bcf/d is currently idle. Our gathering and processing segment owns approximately 14,000 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Second quarter operating income increased significantly to $11.3 million, compared with $4.1 million for the same quarter last year because of:

The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and nonprocessable gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The storage facilities have a combined working capacity of 59.6 Bcf, of which 8 Bcf is temporarily idle.
 
Distribution
 
Second quarter operating income was $418,000, compared with $18.8 million for the same quarter one year ago because of:
 
 
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Second quarter operating income was $30.5 million, compared with $57.6 million for the same quarter a year ago because of:
 
 
 
 
ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading income is primarily generated from the following revenue sources:
 
 
 
 
 
The marketing and trading segment purchases, stores, markets and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct

access to all regions of the country, with great flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also markets and trades oil and power on a smaller scale.
 
2003 Guidance
 
The company confirms previous guidance provided. Net income from continuing operations is expected to be $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share of common stock for 2003. Estimates for the third and fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of common stock are as follows:
 
 
Note: Preferred dividends are expected to exceed earnings for the third quarter, resulting in an antidilutive position for earnings per diluted share of common stock. As a result of this antidilution, the quarters will not add to the total earnings per share reported for the year. This antidilution for the third quarter does not affect the resulting earnings per share for the twelve-month period.
 
At this time, the company still projects 2003 capital expenditures to be about $215 million. The company is seeking an increase in wells proposed for drilling in the production segment and somewhat higher requirements in the distribution segment coming from the Texas operation that may change that number as the year progresses.
 
Cash flow is anticipated to exceed capital expenditures and projected dividends of $71 million by $130 to $150 million.

The ONEOK second quarter conference call will be held at 10 a.m. Eastern time (9 a.m. Central time) on August 1, 2003. Those who wish may join the call on the ONEOK Web site at or call 1-866-482-6973, pass code 3710395.
