If the gross proceeds of the offering exceed $150 million, under the new transaction agreement Westar may also sell in the offering all or any portion of the shares of our common stock that it currently owns, excluding shares of our common stock that we have agreed to repurchase from Westar. A copy of the new transaction agreement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

The term "preliminary prospectus" as used herein means a preliminary prospectus as contemplated by Rule 430 or Rule 430A ("Rule 430A") of the Rules and Regulations included at any time as part of the registration statement. Copies of such registration statement and amendments and of each related preliminary prospectus have been delivered to the Underwriter. The term "Registration Statement" means the registration statement described above, as amended at the time it became effective (the "Effective Date"), including financial statements and 3
all exhibits and any information deemed to be included by Rule 430A or Rule 434 of the Rules and Regulations. If the Company files a registration statement to register a portion of the Shares and relies on Rule 462(b) of the Rules and Regulations for such registration statement to become effective upon filing with the Commission (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement"), then any reference to the "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include the Rule 462 Registration Statement, as amended from time to time. The Company will file with the Commission a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Shares pursuant to Rule 424 or Rule 434 under the Act. The term "Prospectus" means the form of final prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date, as amended and supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement and as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and shall be deemed to include the "electronic Prospectus" provided for use in connection with the offering of the Shares as contemplated by Section 5(j) of this Agreement.

(b) The Company has not received, and has no notice of, any order of the Commission preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or instituting proceedings for that purpose.

If any condition specified in this Section 7 is not satisfied when and as required to be satisfied, this Agreement may be terminated by the Underwriter by notice to the Company, 25
Parent and the Selling Stockholder at any time on or prior to the Closing Date and, with respect to the Option Shares, at any time prior to the Option Closing Date, which termination shall be without liability on the part of any party to any other party, except that Section 5, Section 6, Section 8, Section 10 and Section 12 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. 8. Reimbursement of Underwriter's Expenses. If this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriter pursuant to Section 7, Section 9 or Section 11, or if the sale to the Underwriter of the Firm Shares on the Closing Date is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or to comply with any provision hereof, Parent and the Selling Stockholder jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Underwriter upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses that shall have been reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with the proposed purchase and the offering and sale of the Shares, including but not limited to fees and disbursements of counsel, printing expenses, travel expenses, postage, facsimile and telephone charges. 9.

(b) Prior to such effectiveness, this Agreement may be terminated by any party by notice to each of the other parties hereto, and any such termination shall be without liability on the part of (i) the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter, except that Parent and the Selling Stockholder shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Underwriter pursuant to Sections 5, 6 and 8 hereof, (ii) the Underwriter to the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder or (iii) any party hereto to any other party, except that the provisions of Section 10 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. 10. Indemnification. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including, but not limited to, any and all investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding between any of the indemnified parties and any indemnifying parties or between any indemnified party and any third party, or otherwise, or any claim asserted), as and when incurred, to which the Underwriter, or any such person, may become 26
subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, or in any application or other document executed by or on behalf of the Company or based on written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Shares under the securities laws thereof or filed with the Commission, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in such document a material fact required to be stated in it or necessary to make the statements in it not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by the Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Shares or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent it is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by the Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct); provided that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arises from the sale of the Shares in the public offering to any person by the Underwriter and is based on an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to the Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company might otherwise have. (b) Parent and the Selling Stockholder, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, the legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but only insofar as losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to Parent or the 27
Selling Stockholder furnished in writing to the Company or the Underwriter by Parent or the Selling Stockholder for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus and except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Underwriter consists of the information described as such in subsection (c) below. (c) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each director of the Company and each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement and Parent and the Selling Stockholder to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only insofar as losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with written information relating to the Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by the Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of the Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the fifth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" and the information contained in the thirteenth and fourteenth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting." This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Underwriter may otherwise have; provided, however, that in no case will the Underwriter be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter. (d) Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 10 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section 10, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section 10 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party to assume the defense of the action, with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the 28
defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iv) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred. An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 10 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent if (1) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (2) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (3) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in subsections (a), (b) and (c) is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable to an indemnified party thereunder or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, 29
liabilities, expenses and damages referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder from persons other than the Underwriter, such as persons who control the Company or Parent or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company, who also may be liable for contribution) to which the Company (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising from the Company's obligations under subsection (a)) or Parent or the Selling Stockholder (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising from the obligations of Parent and the Selling Stockholder under subsection (b)) on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising under subsections (a) or (c)) or Parent or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising under subsections (b) or (c)). If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company or Parent or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering. The relative benefits received by the Company or Parent or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising from the Company's obligations under subsection (a)) or Parent or the Selling Stockholder (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising from the obligations of Parent or the Selling Stockholder under subsection (b)) on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact related to information supplied by the Company one the one hand or the Underwriter on the other (in the case of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising under subsections (a) or (c)) or Parent or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other (in the case 30
of losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages arising under subsections (b) or (c)), the relative intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, Parent, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include, for purpose of this subsection (e), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by it and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this subsection (e), any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of the Act will have the same rights to contribution as that party, and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this subsection (e), will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify will not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have under this subsection (e). Except for a settlement entered into pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (d) hereof, no party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). In no event shall the obligations of either Parent or the Selling Stockholder under the foregoing contribution exceed the net proceeds received by Parent or the Selling Stockholder, as the case may be, from the sale of the Shares sold by it hereunder (which net proceeds shall not include the Underwriter's discounts). (f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 10 and the representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and the Selling Stockholder contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, (ii) acceptance of the Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement. 11. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriter under this Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to the Option Shares, on or prior to the Option Closing Date), by notice from the Underwriter to the Company, Parent and the Selling Stockholder if, prior to delivery and payment for the 31
Shares (or the Option Shares, as the case may be), in the sole judgment of the Underwriter, (a) there has been, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective change, which has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; (b) trading in any of the equity securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission, the NASD or the New York Stock Exchange; (c) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange or automated quotation system, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market or by order of the Commission or the NASD or any court or other governmental authority; (d) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York or Oklahoma state authorities; (e) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial or securities markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Underwriter is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to market the Shares in the manner and on the terms described in the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (f) any downgrading, or placement on any watch list for possible downgrading, in the rating of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Exchange Act); (g) the taking of any action by any governmental body or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs that in the judgment of the Underwriter has a material adverse effect on the securities markets in the United States; or (h) the Company shall have sustained a loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or other calamity of such character as in the judgment of the Underwriter may interfere materially with the business and operations of the Company regardless of whether of not such loss shall have been insured. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability on the part of (i) the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriter, except that Parent and the Selling Stockholder shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Underwriter pursuant to Sections 5, 6 and 8 hereof, (ii) the Underwriter to the Company, Parent or the Selling Stockholder or (iii) of any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Section 10 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. 12.

Any notice under Section 11 may be made by telecopy or telephone, but if so made shall be subsequently confirmed in writing. (b) This Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of the Underwriter, the Company, Parent and the Selling Stockholder and of the controlling persons, directors and officers referred to in Section 10, and their respective successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term "successors and assigns" as used in this Agreement shall not include a purchaser, as such purchaser, of Shares from the Underwriter. (c) All representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, Parent and the Selling Stockholder contained herein or in certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any of its controlling persons and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares hereunder. (d) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (e) Except as set forth below, no claim may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall have jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto.

Such counsel hereby confirms to the Underwriter that such counsel has been orally advised by the Commission that the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and that, to such counsel's knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or is threatened, pending or contemplated.

arbitrator that (i) seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of the Agreement or the Shares, (ii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein, seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of any of the Documents filed, or required to be filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement, (iii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein seek damages or other remedies with respect to any of the Documents filed, or required to be filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek money damages in excess of 10% of the current assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or seek to impose criminal penalties upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as such and of which such counsel has knowledge, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company's business, or (v) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek to enjoin any of the business activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions described in the Prospectus and of which such counsel has knowledge.

counsel shall state that in such counsel's opinion that such counsel and the Underwriter are justified in relying on such opinions of other counsel. Copies of all such opinions and certificates shall be furnished to counsel to the Underwriter on the Closing Date.

For purposes of paragraph 3 and 13(e) above, such counsel has reviewed only those statutes, rules and regulations, including regulatory rules and regulations, that in such counsel's experience are applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Agreement or the Indenture or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Shares. For purposes of the foregoing opinion, the term "knowledge" shall mean the conscious awareness of information by any Primary Lawyer, without undertaking any investigation. The term "Primary Lawyer" shall mean each lawyer in such counsel's Firm who gave substantive attention to representations of the Company in connection with the transaction described in the Prospectus. Capitalized terms used in such opinion but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement, except the term "Subsidiaries" shall not include any subsidiaries listed on Schedule II to the Agreement as being organized under the laws of Mexico ("Excluded Subsidiaries") and counsel shall not be required to express any opinions regarding any Excluded Subsidiaries.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
Tulsa, Okla.  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that it has been informed by Westar Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WR) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc. (collectively, "Westar"), that Westar plans to conduct a secondary offering to the public of 9.5 million shares of ONEOK common stock. At least the first $150 million of shares sold in the offering will represent shares of ONEOK common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of ONEOK $0.925 Series D Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Westar. If the gross proceeds of the offering exceed $150 million, Westar may also sell in the offering, to the extent of the excess, all or a portion of the shares of ONEOK common stock that it currently owns, excluding shares of ONEOK common stock that ONEOK has agreed to purchase from Westar. Based on today's $20.36 closing price on the New York Stock Exchange, total proceeds from the offering would be approximately $193 million. ONEOK will not receive any proceeds from the offering.
 
Upon closing of Westar's offering with gross proceeds in excess of $150 million, ONEOK has agreed to repurchase $50 million of its common shares from Westar at a price equal to the public offering price in the secondary offering.
 
JPMorgan will be the sole underwriter for the offering and will be granted an option by Westar to purchase up to an additional 1.425 million shares of ONEOK common stock to cover over-allotments, if any.
 
A preliminary prospectus supplement related to the public offering has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement related to the offering and the underlying prospectus may be obtained from J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Chase Distribution & Support Service, 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, Floor 5B, New York, NY 10081. Copies can also be obtained by e-mail at Addressing.Services@jpmchase.com.
 
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction.
