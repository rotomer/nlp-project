Results of Operations
 
On October 30, 2003, ONEOK, Inc. announced its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Tulsa, Okla. ONEOK, Inc., (NYSE:OKE) today announced net income of $4.6 million, or 1 cent per diluted share of common stock for the third quarter 2003.
 
David Kyle, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK, said, "The third quarter was much better than expected. Higher prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids, and the impact of the rate order in Kansas resulted in higher earnings. A concentrated effort to reduce operating costs was also effective. In addition, third quarter earnings reflect the recognition of approximately $11 million in revenues in the marketing and trading operation which related to the first and second quarters of 2003."
 
Third quarter 2003 results included:
 
 
 
 
The following table shows the components of net income. All numbers are net of tax:

Third quarter business unit results:
 
Production
 
Third quarter operating income increased to $3.5 million from $2.1 million for the same quarter last year because of:
 
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Third quarter operating income increased to $17.5 million, compared with $13.9 million for the same quarter last year because of:
 
 
 
 
The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 2 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.2 Bcf/d is currently idle. Our gathering and processing segment owns approximately 14,000 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Third quarter operating income decreased to $10.8 million, compared with $17.5 million for the same quarter last year because of:
 
 
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The storage facilities have a combined working capacity of 59.6 Bcf, of which 8 Bcf is temporarily idle.

Distribution
 
Third quarter resulted in an operating loss of $6 million, compared with a loss of $14.1 million for the same quarter one year ago because of:
 
 
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Third quarter operating income was $6.3 million, compared with $44.2 million for the same quarter a year ago because of:
 
 
 
 
ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading income is primarily generated from the following revenue sources:
 
 
 
 
 
The marketing and trading segment purchases, stores, markets and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country, with great flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also markets and trades oil and power on a smaller scale.

2003 Guidance
 
The previous guidance provided is being revised upward. Net income from continuing operations is expected to be $2.08 to $2.12 per diluted share of common stock for 2003. Estimates for the fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of common stock are as follows:
 
 
Note: The level of preferred dividend requirements for the third quarter resulted in an antidilutive position reducing earnings per diluted share of common stock by 4 cents. The antidulution for the third quarter does not affect the resulting earnings per share for the twelve-month period. In addition, changes in the number of shares due to the equity transactions during the year will cause the earnings per diluted share for the quarters to not add to the earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year.
 
The company has increased its projection of 2003 capital expenditures to a range of $225 to $230 million due to an increase in drilling in the production segment and somewhat higher requirements in the distribution segment coming from the Texas operation.
 
Cash flow before changes in working capital is anticipated to exceed capital expenditures and $71 million of projected dividends by $150 to $180 million.
 
Earnings Conference Call
 
The ONEOK third quarter conference call will be held at 10 a.m. Eastern time (9 a.m. Central time) on October 31, 2003. Those who wish may join the call on the ONEOK Web site at or call 1-866-482-6973, pass code 3831723.
