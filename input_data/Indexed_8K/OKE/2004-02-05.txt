Other Events
 
On February 4, 2004, ONEOK, Inc. (the "Company") received notice that it and its wholly owned subsidiary, ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P., have been named along with others as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought on behalf of persons who bought and sold natural gas futures and options contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange during the years 2000 through 2002. The Complaint seeks class certification, actual damages in unspecified amounts for alleged violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, recovery of costs of the suit, including attorney's fees, and other appropriate relief. The Complaint states that it is filed as a related action to a consolidated class action complaint naming a number of other defendants in the energy industry. The Company has not yet been served in this matter. Although it is too early to accurately evaluate this matter, based on current information available to us, we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
