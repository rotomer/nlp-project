(p) The Shares have been duly authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance.
 
Such counsel hereby confirms to the Underwriter that such counsel has been orally advised by the Commission that the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and that, to such counsel's knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or is threatened, pending or contemplated. Any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by such Rule 424(b).
 
Such counsel hereby further confirms to the Underwriter that, to such counsel's knowledge, there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as such, before or by any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (i) seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of the Agreement or the Shares, (ii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein, seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of any of the Documents filed, or required to be filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement, (iii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein seek damages or other remedies with respect to any of the Documents filed, or required to be
 
filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek money damages in excess of 10% of the current assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or seek to impose criminal penalties upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as such and of which such counsel has knowledge, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company's business, or (v) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek to enjoin any of the business activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions described in the Prospectus and of which such counsel has knowledge.
 
Such counsel has participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. From time to time in connection therewith such counsel has had discussions with (i) officers and representatives of the Company, (ii) representatives of KPMG LLP, the independent accountants who examined certain of the financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and (iii) the Underwriter's representatives and counsel concerning the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. Such counsel has not independently verified and is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus except to the extent set forth in paragraphs 7 and 11 above. Based solely upon the participation and discussions described above, however, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when read collectively (except for the following as to which such counsel is not called upon to express a view (a) financial statements, schedules and other financial data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein) and (b) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" in the Prospectus as having been included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus on the authority of KPMG LLP as experts), as of the date thereof or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering the foregoing opinion, counsel may rely, to the extent they deem such reliance proper, on the opinions of other counsel to the Company as to matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and the State of Oklahoma, and as to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company and of government officials; provided that such counsel shall state that in such counsel's opinion that such counsel and the Underwriter are justified in relying on such opinions of other counsel. Copies of all such opinions and certificates shall be furnished to counsel to the Underwriter on the Closing Date. For purposes of paragraph 3 and 13(e) above, such counsel has reviewed only those statutes, rules and regulations, including regulatory rules and regulations, that in such counsel's experience are applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Agreement or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Shares. For purposes of the foregoing opinion, the term
 
"knowledge" shall mean the conscious awareness of information by any Primary Lawyer, without undertaking any investigation. The term "Primary Lawyer" shall mean each lawyer in such counsel's Firm who gave substantive attention to representations of the Company in connection with the transaction described in the Prospectus.
 
Capitalized terms used in such opinion but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement, except the term "Subsidiaries" shall not include any subsidiaries listed on Schedule II to the Agreement as being organized under the laws of Mexico or Canada ("Excluded Subsidiaries") and counsel shall not be required to express any opinions regarding any Excluded Subsidiaries.
