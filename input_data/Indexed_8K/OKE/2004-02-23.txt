2003 business segment results
 
Production
 
Operating income increased to $16.1 million in 2003 compared with $10.3 million in 2002 because of:

These increases were partially offset by increased operating costs resulting from:
 
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income for 2003 increased by almost 90 percent to $62.7 million, compared with $33.1 million for 2002 as a result of:
 
 
These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues and volumes resulting from the sale of gas processing plants and related gathering systems in December 2002.
 
The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage, transportation and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 2 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.2 Bcf/d is currently idle. Our gathering and processing segment owns approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income decreased to $50.8 million in 2003, compared with $53.3 million in 2002 as a result of:
 
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and

Texas. The storage facilities have a combined working capacity of 59.6 Bcf, of which 8 Bcf is temporarily idle.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income in 2003 increased to $117.8 million, compared with $95.2 million in 2002 as a result of:
 
 
Fiscal 2002 included an additional $14.2 million in operating income due to a reduction in gas costs based on our settlement with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Operating income increased to $197 million in 2003, compared with $181.5 million in 2002 as a result of:
 
 
The revenue from Marketing and Trading is derived from the following three sources:
 
 
The marketing and trading segment purchases, stores, markets and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country providing flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. The segment also markets and trades oil and power on a smaller scale.

Fourth quarter business unit results
 
Production
 
Fourth quarter operating income decreased to $3.8 million from $4.4 million for the same quarter last year as a result of increased operating and employee costs.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $21.6 million, compared with $17.9 million for the same quarter last year as a result of increases in prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil.
 
These increases were partially offset by:
 
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Fourth quarter operating income decreased to $13.5 million, compared with $15.3 million for the same quarter last year as a result of the sale of operational inventory gas in 2002, which provided $4.7 in net revenues, and increased employee costs and general taxes. This decrease in operating income was partially offset by the impact of higher prices on the valuation of net retained fuel.
 
Distribution
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $48.3 million, compared with $30.4 million for the same quarter one year ago as a result of:
 
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Fourth quarter operating income was $33.2 million, compared with $17.1 million for the same quarter a year ago as a result of new market penetration into the upper Midwest and the Southeast corridor of the United States. The 2002 operating income reflects the impact of mark-to-market accounting for certain storage and transportation contracts, which are accounted for under accrual accounting for 2003.
