Tulsa, Okla. -- ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced it has terminated its agreement to purchase the 22.5 percent interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators owned by ConocoPhillips. A condition to close the transaction regarding operatorship was not able to be obtained from third parties and as such, both ONEOK and ConocoPhillips have mutually terminated the purchase and sale agreement related to this facility.
"We are disappointed that we could not complete this transaction which would have expanded our natural gas liquids footprint into the Mont Belvieu market," said John W. Gibson, President-Energy. "The purchase of the ConocoPhillips interest was predicated on becoming the operator of the facility. We will however continue to pursue assets to expand our current NGL operations."
The transaction would have cost an estimated $23 million.
