Tulsa, Okla. -- ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) announced today it has reached an agreement to sell two ONEOK subsidiaries holding interests in a natural gas distribution system and related business in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico to Coahuila Energy, LLC. The sales price is approximately $2 million.
Specifically, ONEOK sold to Coahuila Energy all of the stock of ONEOK Energy International, Inc. and ONEOK International Investments, Inc., which held a minority interest in a natural gas distribution system and related businesses in Mexico. ONEOK acquired these investments as part of the January 2003 purchase of Southern Union's Texas assets.
"The sale of these subsidiaries continues to demonstrate our commitment to divest of non-core holdings and allows us to focus on our business interests within the ONEOK footprint," said Jim Kneale, senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of ONEOK.
The transaction is expected to close in early May 2004.
