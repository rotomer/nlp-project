Item 12.
Results of Operations
 
On April 28, 2004, ONEOK, Inc. announced its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Tulsa, Okla. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced net income for first quarter 2004 of $105.2 million, or $1.04 per diluted share of common stock, compared to $22.4 million, or 28 cents per diluted share of common stock, for 2003.
 
David Kyle, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK, said, "I am pleased with the positive impact of our recent gas and oil production acquisition, the authorized rate relief in two of our distribution operations and the continuing success of our efforts to mitigate unfavorable price spreads in our gathering and processing segment. Lower natural gas volatility led to reduced margins in our marketing and trading segment, but the benefits of our diversification throughout the natural gas value chain is evident by our overall results."
 
"Total earnings for the quarter are in line with our expectations, and our earnings guidance for 2004 has not changed. We continue to believe our 2004 earnings will range from $2.12 to $2.18 per diluted share of common stock."

ONEOK business outlook:

2004 Business unit results:
 
Production
 
Operating income increased to $11.9 million for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $5.7 million in 2003 primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Texas gas and oil properties in December 2003. The acquired properties produced 2.5 Bcf of natural gas and 35,000 barrels of oil during the first quarter of 2004. Operating income also benefited from an increase in average natural gas prices, after hedges, to $5.36 per Mcf in 2004 from $5.23 per Mcf in 2003.
 
The acquisition of the Texas gas and oil properties also resulted in increased operating costs including:
 
 
 
Expansion of the Production segment's developmental drilling program resulted in participation in 45 wells with 11 wells completed during the first quarter of 2004, compared to participation in 13 wells with four completed during the same period in 2003. For the remainder

of 2004, we have hedged approximately 87 percent of our anticipated natural gas production at an average net price at the wellhead of $5.28 per Mcf and 92 percent of our anticipated oil production at a fixed NYMEX price of $30.35 per Bbl. Currently, we have hedges on 20 MMcf per day of our 2005 natural gas production at a net wellhead price of $5.68 per Mcf. We have also hedged an additional 10 MMcf per day for the first quarter of 2005 at a net wellhead price of $6.12 per Mcf.
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income for 2004 increased by 158 percent to $20.4 million, compared to $7.9 million for 2003 because of:
 
 
 
The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 1.9 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.1 Bcf/d is currently idle. Our gathering and processing segment owns approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income decreased to $13.5 million in 2004, compared to $15.1 million for 2003. Although net revenues were flat compared to 2003, there were offsetting differences between the periods, including:
 
 
 
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The storage facilities have a combined working capacity of 59.6 Bcf, of which 8 Bcf is temporarily idle.

Distribution
 
Operating income for the first quarter of 2004 increased to $85.7 million, compared to $75 million for 2003, primarily because of:
 
 
 
 
These increases were partially offset by increased amortizations resulting from the rate increases, increased bad debt costs and increased depreciation expense.
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Operating income was $63.4 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared to $126.9 million in 2003 due to:
 
 
 
 
Decreased margins were partly offset as the lower price volatility enabled the higher retention of reservation fees associated with peaking service.
 
The marketing and trading segment purchases, stores, transports, markets and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country and flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also markets and trades crude oil and power on a smaller scale.
