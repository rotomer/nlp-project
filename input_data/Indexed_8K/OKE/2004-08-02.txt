Item 12.
Results of Operations
 
On August 2, 2004, ONEOK, Inc. announced its results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Tulsa, Okla. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced that net income for the second quarter of 2004 exceeded analyst expectations. Net income was $17.8 million, or 17 cents per diluted share of common stock, and First Call average of analyst estimates was 16 cents per share. For the same period in 2003, net income was $22.5 million, or 23 cents per diluted share of common stock.
 
For the six months, net income was $122.9 million, or $1.20 per diluted share of common stock, compared to $45 million, or 51 cents per diluted share of common stock, for 2003.
 
David Kyle, ONEOK's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased with our earnings and our continued strong cash flows. Our gathering and processing business continues to deliver strong results. Higher commodity prices, improved keep whole spread conditions, and our ongoing strategy of restructuring contracts had a positive impact. The production segment, as expected, is contributing positively due to last year's acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in east Texas.
 
"Typically during the second and third quarters, we experience lower operating results from our marketing group as we focus on injecting gas into storage in preparation for winter customer demands. We have renewed our focus on our physical marketing business and recently added three new LDC customers and two new large industrial customers. In addition, we expect to begin reporting revenues from our non-trading activities on a gross basis beginning in the third quarter.
 
"As a result of the improved outlook in our gathering and processing segment we have increased our earnings guidance for 2004 by 6 cents, or to a new range of $2.18 to $2.24 per share. Earnings per share are also estimated to be 18 cents and 82 cents for the third and fourth quarters, respectively.

2004 Business unit results
 
Production
 
Operating income increased to $12 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $3.2 million in 2003 for our production operation primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Texas gas and oil properties in December 2003. The acquired properties produced 2.2 Bcf of natural gas and 32,000 barrels of oil during the second quarter of 2004. Operating income also benefited from a hedged natural gas price of $5.04 per thousand cubic feet in 2004 compared to $4.75 per thousand cubic feet in 2003.
 
The acquisition of the Texas gas and oil properties increased lease-operating expense by approximately $1.8 million. We also participated in drilling 22 development wells during the second quarter of 2004 compared to 14 wells in the same quarter last year, and completed 16 wells during the second quarter of 2004 compared to 8 wells in the same quarter in 2003.

For the remainder of 2004, we have hedged approximately 95 percent of our anticipated natural gas production at an average net price at the wellhead of $5.50 per thousand cubic feet and 100 percent of our anticipated oil production at a fixed NYMEX price of $30.35 per barrel. Currently, we have hedges on 20 million cubic feet per day of our 2005 natural gas production at a net wellhead price of $5.68 per thousand cubic feet. We have also hedged an additional 10 million cubic feet per day for the first quarter of 2005 at a net wellhead price of $6.12 per thousand cubic feet.
 
Operating income for the fiscal year to date was $23.8 million compared to $8.9 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income from our gathering and processing operation increased 73 percent to $27.3 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $15.8 million for 2003 because of:
 
 
 
 
Operating income for the fiscal year to date was $47.8 million compared to $23.6 million for the same period in 2003.
 
For the remainder of 2004, we have hedged approximately 50 percent of our company-owned condensate sales at an average NYMEX price of $38.38 per barrel. We have also pre-sold for the remainder of 2004 approximately 50 percent of certain company-owned natural gas liquids at a weighted average price of 62 cents per gallon.
 
The following table sets forth our contract mix on a volumetric basis for the periods indicated:

The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 1.9 billion cubic feet per day, of which approximately 1 million cubic feet per day is currently idle. Our gathering and processing segment owns approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income from our transportation and storage operation was $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2003. Although operating income and net revenues were flat compared to 2003, there were offsetting differences between the periods, including:
 
 
 
Operating income for the fiscal year to date was $24.6 million compared to $26.5 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The storage facilities have a combined working capacity of 59.6 billion cubic feet, of which 8 billion cubic feet is temporarily idle.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income from our distribution operation was a loss of $2.7 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to income of $0.4 million for the same period in 2003, primarily due to the combination of the following:
 
 
 
 
Operating income for the fiscal year to date was $83 million compared to $75.4 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas

distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Marketing and Trading
 
Operating income from our marketing and trading operation was $4.9 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $30.5 million for the same period in 2003. For the fiscal year to date, operating income was $68.3 million compared to $157.4 million in 2003. The revenue from marketing and trading was derived from the following three sources:
 
 
The decrease in operating income for the second quarter of 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 is primarily due to:
 
 
 
 
 
As we look to the balance of 2004, we still have 25 billion cubic feet of natural gas to inject into our total leased capacity of 84 billion cubic feet. Current NYMEX natural gas spreads to the winter are over 80 cents per MMbtu. This fall, we expect to start reaping benefits from our Canadian market expansion with improved capability of serving northeastern United States markets. We continue to expand our peaking services with both new and existing customers.
 
The marketing and trading segment purchases, stores, transports, markets and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country and flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also markets and trades crude oil and power on a smaller scale.
