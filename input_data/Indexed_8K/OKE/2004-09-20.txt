The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
 
(b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(c) (i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount

is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).
Request for Increase

(b) . Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
Lender Elections to Increase
 
(c) . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders
 
(d) . If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "") and the final allocation of such increase.

We are rendering this opinion to you pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(vi) of the Credit Agreement.
 
We advise you that, while we represent the Company on a number of matters, there may be many matters of a legal nature concerning the Company about which we have not been consulted and concerning which we have no knowledge.
 
 
We have assumed, with your approval, that (a) each of the parties (collectively, the "") to the Credit Agreement (1) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and (2) has the power, authority and all necessary governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to execute, deliver and perform is obligations under the Credit Agreement; (b) the execution, delivery and performance by each Party of the Credit Agreement (1) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Party and (2) do not and will not (A) contravene the terms of its charter, bylaws or other organizational documents or (B) violate any law (statutory or common), treaty, rule or regulation or determination of an arbitrator or of a governmental authority applicable to such Party; (c) the Parties have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, for value received; (d) the Credit Agreement is the valid and binding obligation of each Party other than the Company (each such Party, an ""), enforceable against such Other Party in accordance with its terms; (e) the representations and warranties made in the Credit Agreement with respect to all factual matters are true and complete in all respects; (f) each of the Other Parties and their respective agents have acted in good faith; (g) each of the Other Parties has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce the Credit Agreement against the Company, and (h) no registration, consent, approval, license or authorization by, or notice to or filing with any person or governmental authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the Credit Agreement by any Other Party.
Parties
Other Party
 
Additionally, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies or facsimiles and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
We have further assumed that (1) no Other Party has made or will make any distribution of any rights under the Credit Agreement which would violate federal or state securities laws; (2) all terms, provisions and conditions of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement are correctly and completely embodied therein; (3) there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the terms of the Credit Agreement; (4) the constitutionality or validity of a relevant statute, rule, regulation or agency action is not an issue unless a reported decision in a jurisdiction within the scope of this opinion has specifically addressed but not resolved, or has established, its unconstitutionality or invalidity; (5) the Company will obtain all permits and governmental approvals required in the future, and take all actions similarly required, relevant to subsequent consummation of the transaction or performance of the Credit Agreement; (6) the Parties will act in accordance with, and will refrain from taking any action that is forbidden by, the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement; (7) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact, misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; (8) each of the Other Parties has acted without notice of any defense against the enforcement of any right created by the Credit Agreement, and (9) all remedies under the Credit Agreement will be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner and without breach of the peace.
 
 
Based on the foregoing, and having due regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes, under the internal laws of the State of New York, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
 
 
This opinion is subject to and qualified in all respects by the following:
 
The validity and enforceability of the Credit Agreement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy (including but not limited to preference, fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer provisions), insolvency, reorganization, rearrangement, moratorium, liquidation and other similar laws (including court decisions) now or hereafter in effect and affecting the rights of creditors generally; (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such validity and enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (c) by judicial discretion.
 
We express no opinion as to whether a court would grant specific performance or any other equitable remedy with respect to the Credit Agreement or any particular remedy under the Credit Agreement as opposed to any other remedy available under the Credit Agreement, at law or in equity.
 
We express no opinion as to any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The opinions set forth above relate only to laws, rules and regulations which in our experience are normally directly applicable to the Company and transactions of the type provided for in the Credit Agreement, excluding any law, rule or regulation relating to (a) pollution or protection of the environment; (b) zoning, land use, building or construction; (c) labor, employee rights and benefits and occupational safety and health; (d) utility regulation; (e) tax, litigation and other filings in the ordinary course of business, and (f) taxation.
 
We express no opinion as to any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code or similar provision of law of any county, town, municipality, or similar political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof (such as, for example, districts and authorities).
 
Our opinion as to validity and enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the qualification that certain provisions of the Credit Agreement are or may be unenforceable in whole or in part under the laws of the State of New York, but the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity of the Credit Agreement taken as a whole, and the Credit Agreement taken as a whole, together with applicable law, contains adequate provisions for its enforcement and for the practical realization of the rights and benefits afforded thereby, except for the economic consequences of any delay occasioned thereby.
 
We note that Section 2.03(g) of the Credit Agreement provides that the Company pledges and grants to the Administrative Agent a security interest in certain cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds thereof. We understand that no such property has been delivered to, or made subject to the control of, the Administrative Agent, and we express no opinion as to the creation, perfection or priority of any security interest in or lien on such property.
 
 
In rendering this opinion and with your concurrence, we have made no independent investigation as to the accuracy or completeness of any representation, warranty, data or other information, written or oral, that may have been made by or on behalf of the Parties, and we have assumed in rendering this opinion that none of such information, if any, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstance in which they are made, not misleading. In that connection and with your concurrence, we have not made any examination of any technical, accounting or financial matters, or any matter requiring computation, and express no opinion with respect thereto.
 
This opinion is limited in all respects to the laws of the State of New York, in each case as now in effect, which have been published and are generally available in a format that makes legal research reasonably feasible and we disclaim any responsibility to inform you of any changes. No opinion is expressed as to any matter that may be governed by the laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
This opinion is solely for the benefit of and may be relied upon only by the Other Parties and their respective counsel in connection with the transactions described in the Credit Agreement. This opinion may not be relied upon by any Other Party or its counsel for any other purpose, or by any other entity or individual for any purpose, in whole or in part, in each case without our express prior written consent.
