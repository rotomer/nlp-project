Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Tulsa, Oklahoma  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced earnings guidance for 2005 in the range of $2.22 to $2.28 per diluted share of common stock. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $2.18 to $2.24 per diluted share of common stock.
 
ONEOK Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Kyle, said, "We believe in 2005 we will see earnings growth in our production, gathering and processing and distribution segments. As we have stated before, we no longer include in our earnings targets income from financial trading activities. The 2005 guidance for our energy services segment includes only margins from our physical storage and marketing businesses. While we may benefit from some trading activities, those margins will be accretive to this guidance."
 
Kyle also added, "Our recently announced acquisition of Northern Border Partners will be slightly accretive to 2005 and is included in our range of earnings per share."
 
Production
 
Operating income is forecasted to be up over 34 percent in 2005 compared with 2004. We anticipate higher average natural gas prices on unhedged volumes and higher natural gas prices on our production hedges. For 2005, we are about 41 percent hedged on our expected production. Natural gas production is anticipated to be slightly above the prior year at 19.9 Bcf. Currently 7.3 Bcf of our 2005 natural gas production is hedged at a net wellhead price of $5.68 per Mcf. An additional 0.9 Bcf of our first quarter natural gas production is hedged at a net wellhead price of $6.12 per Mcf. The realized price for 2004 natural gas production is forecast to be $5.28 per Mcf at the wellhead. Additionally, the company has hedged approximately 45 percent or 182,000 barrels of its oil production for 2005 at a NYMEX price of $39.75. Oil production for 2005 is estimated at 406,000 barrels.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Although we anticipate commodity prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas sold under percentage-of-proceeds contracts to be lower in 2005, operating income is expected to increase in 2005 because of the continued effect of higher NGL to natural gas spreads for keep-whole contracts. Natural gas prices are projected for 2005 at an average NYMEX price of $5.75 and crude oil is projected at an average price of approximately $35 per barrel. Additionally, we

project the Conway OPIS composite NGL price per gallon to be about $0.65 for 2005. Results will vary due to changes in operations to enhance results from price movements.
 
These estimates also reflect the continued restructuring of unprofitable contracts and the addition of conditioning language in keep-whole contracts that provides a floor related to unfavorable processing spreads. The company expects wellhead volumes to remain flat year over year.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income is expected to be comparable to 2004. Assumptions for this business unit include operating and capital expenditures remaining flat as compared to 2004 coupled with a slight increase in throughput.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income is expected to increase by approximately 6 percent based on the impact of both rate increases achieved in 2004 and certain rate actions planned for 2005. The revenue increases will be somewhat offset by higher employee costs within the segment.
 
Energy Services
 
Energy Services is projecting operating income of $131 million in 2005 from providing physical energy services that include natural gas storage, transportation and marketing activities to end-use markets and the utility sector. Currently we are forecasting no margin for trading opportunities in 2005. As a point of reference the 2004 guidance of $155 million for energy services includes $27 million from trading opportunities.
