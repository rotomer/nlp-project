Tulsa, Okla.--After four weeks, a jury has reached a verdict in a class action lawsuit that was filed three years ago against ONEOK, Inc. arising out of the escape of natural gas from the Yaggy storage field outside of Hutchinson, Kansas.
While the plaintiffs sought damages in excess of $50 million exclusive of punitive damages, the jury has awarded $5 million in actual damages to the residential class. No damages were awarded to the business class. No punitive damages were awarded. The $5 million is covered by insurance.
This trial concludes all litigation related to the Yaggy incident, with the exception of one case, which ONEOK is appealing.
