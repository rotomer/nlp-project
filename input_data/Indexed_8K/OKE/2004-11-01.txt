Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Tulsa, Okla.ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced net income for the third quarter of 2004 of $20.8 million, or 19 cents per diluted share of common stock, which exceeded analysts' expectations and was significantly above last year's third quarter earnings of $4.6 million, or 1 cent per diluted share of common stock. The First Call average of analysts' estimates was 18 cents per share.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, net income was $143.8 million, or $1.38 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $49.6 million, or 57 cents per diluted share of common stock, for 2003.
 
ONEOK's chairman, president and chief executive officer, David Kyle, said, "Our third quarter earnings reflect the continued success of our business strategy. The strongest results came from gathering and processing where we benefited from wider processing spreads and our contract restructuring efforts which have positioned us to benefit from higher commodity prices. Additionally, we have experienced a positive impact from our 2003 acquisition of producing properties in Texas.
 
"These increases and other changes during the quarter have resulted in an increase in our 2004 earnings guidance to a range of $2.25 to $2.31 per diluted share of common stock."
 
Kyle added, "We are continuing to move forward with our acquisition of the 82.5 percent general partner interest in Northern Border Partners and we expect to close in the fourth quarter. We are very excited about the prospects of owning this general partnership interest in one of the nation's premier pipeline master limited partnerships. This transaction compliments our strategy and provides a competitive financial structure for future acquisition opportunities."

ONEOK business outlook
 
We have increased our earnings guidance for 2004 to a range of $2.25 to $2.31 per diluted share of common stock from $2.18 to $2.24 per diluted share of common stock. This increase is a result of the impact of continued strength in natural gas prices, natural gas liquids prices and keep-whole spreads on the gathering and processing segment. In addition, we reaffirm our 2005 earnings guidance in the range of $2.22 to $2.28 per diluted share of common stock, which, as previously disclosed, does not include earnings from trading opportunities which have been included in the 2004 reported results.
 
A summary of the revised earnings guidance is attached.
 
2004 business segment results
 
Production
 
Operating income from production increased to $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $3.5 million in 2003. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of the Texas producing properties in December 2003. The acquired properties produced 2.1 Bcf of natural gas and 28,600 barrels of oil during the third quarter of 2004. Operating income also benefited from a realized natural gas price of $5.17 per Mcf in 2004 compared with $4.65 per Mcf in 2003.

For the remainder of 2004, we have hedged approximately 95 percent of our anticipated natural gas production at an average net price at the wellhead of $5.50 per Mcf and 100 percent of our anticipated oil production at a fixed NYMEX price of $30.35 per barrel.
 
For 2005, we are approximately 63 percent hedged on our expected natural gas production. We have hedges on 19 MMcf per day of our 2005 natural gas production at a net wellhead price of $5.69 per Mcf. We have also hedged an additional 9.8 MMcf per day of our first quarter 2005 natural gas production at a net wellhead price of $6.12 per Mcf and 9.8 MMcf per day of natural gas production for the remaining three quarters of 2005 at a net wellhead price of $6.22 per Mcf. Also for 2005, we have hedged 15,000 barrels per month or 49 percent of our anticipated oil production at a fixed NYMEX price of $39.75 per barrel.
 
Year to date operating income for this business segment increased to $34.8 million in 2004 from $12.3 million for the same period in 2003, primarily due to the acquisition of the Texas properties.
 
The production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income from our gathering and processing operations increased to $41.3 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $17.5 million for 2003 because of:
 
 
 
 
Currently, we have hedged approximately 66 percent of our anticipated company-owned condensate sales at an average NYMEX price of $39.40 per barrel and pre-sold approximately 57 percent of our anticipated company-owned NGLs at a weighted average price of $0.61 per gallon for the remainder of 2004. In addition, we have hedged approximately 67 percent of our anticipated keep-whole volumes at an average gross processing spread of $3.44 per MMBtu for the remainder of 2004.
 
For 2005, we have hedged approximately 50 percent of our anticipated company-owned condensate sales at an average NYMEX price of $44.59 per barrel and pre-sold approximately 34 percent of our anticipated company-owned NGLs at a weighted average price of $0.74 per gallon. We have also hedged approximately 52 percent of our anticipated 2005 natural gas sales at a weighted average price of $6.66 per MMBtu.

Operating income for this business segment for the year to date was $89.1 million compared with $41.1 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has approximately 1.8 Bcf/d of processing capacity and approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income from our transportation and storage operations was $11.8 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $10.8 million for the same period in 2003. The differences between the periods were:
 
 
 
Year to date operating income for this business segment was $36.4 million compared with $37.3 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Our facilities have a combined working storage capacity of approximately 51.6 Bcf and approximately 5,500 miles of transportation pipeline with a maximum throughput of 2.9 Bcf/d.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income from our distribution operations was a loss of $17.6 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with a loss of $6 million for the same period in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the combination of the following:
 
 
 
 
Year to date operating income for this business segment was $65.4 million compared with $69.5 million for the same period in 2003.

The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve almost 2 million customers.
 
Energy Services
 
Operating income from our energy services operations was $11 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $6.3 million for the same period in 2003. At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, we completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and renewed our focus on our physical marketing and storage business. We separated management and operations of our physical marketing, retail marketing and trading activities and began accounting separately for the different types of revenue and margins earned from these activities. Concurrent with this reorganization, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to the presentation of revenues from the different types of activities and determined that revenues from non-trading activities should be reported on a gross basis. As a result, we are reporting the realized revenues and purchase costs of our non-trading activities on a gross basis beginning in the third quarter. No prior periods have been adjusted for this change. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income, but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel.
 
The net margin from energy services for the three months ended September 30, 2004, was derived from the following three sources:
 
 
The increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003 is due to a combination of the following:
 
 
Year to date operating income was $79.3 million compared with $163.8 million for the same period in 2003.

Natural gas in storage at September 30, 2004 was 79.1 Bcf, or 86.8 percent of capacity, compared with 71.1 Bcf, or 88.4 percent of capacity, at September 30, 2003.
 
The energy services segment purchases, stores, transports and markets natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country and flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also trades natural gas and power on a smaller scale.
