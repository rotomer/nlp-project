ONEOK BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Production
 
Operating income from our production operations increased to $47.8 million in 2004, compared with $16.1 million in 2003, and was impacted by:
 
 
 
 
The following table sets forth hedging information for our Production segment for 2005.

Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income from our gathering and processing operations increased to $131.0 million in 2004, compared with $62.7 million in 2003, primarily due to:

These increases were partially offset by increased operating costs related to higher employee costs and the settlement of various contract disputes and increased depreciation expense related to our normal capital expenditure program.

The gathering and processing segment is engaged in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has approximately 1.8 Bcf/d of active processing capacity and approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income from our transportation and storage operations was $59.8 million in 2004, compared with $50.8 million in 2003. The primary differences between the periods were:
 
 
 
 
 
The transportation and storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Our facilities have a combined active working storage capacity of approximately 51.6 Bcf and approximately 5,600 miles of transportation pipeline with a maximum throughput of 2.9 Bcf/d.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income from our distribution operations was $110.2 million for 2004, compared with $117.8 million for 2003. The primary differences between periods were:

2004. By statute, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has 180 days to review and rule on the request. Based on this schedule, an order is expected in late July 2005.
 
The distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. The companies are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, the companies serve over 2 million customers.
 
Energy Services
 
Operating income from our energy services operations was $137.8 million in 2004, compared with $197.0 million in 2003. The primary differences between periods were:
 
 
 
 
 
As a result of the reorganization of our Energy Services segment in the third quarter of 2004, we began reporting the realized revenues and purchase costs of our non-trading activities on a gross basis. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income, but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel.
 
The net margin for the six months ended December 31, 2004, was derived from the following three sources:
 
 
Our natural gas in storage at December 31, 2004, was 70.6 Bcf, or 76.5 percent of capacity, compared with 68.5 Bcf, or 85 percent of capacity, at December 31, 2003.

The energy services segment purchases, stores, transports and markets natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country and flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also trades natural gas.
 
Fourth quarter business unit results
 
Production
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $13.0 million from $3.8 million for the same quarter last year, as a result of the acquisition of the Texas oil and gas producing properties in December 2003.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $41.9 million, compared with $21.6 million for the same quarter last year, primarily as a result of increases in prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $23.4 million, compared with $13.5 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to the sale of operational gas inventory in 2004, which provided $8.9 million in net margin.
 
Distribution
 
Fourth quarter operating income decreased to $44.8 million in 2004 from $48.3 million in the same quarter last year. The primary differences between periods were:
 
 
 
 
Energy Services
 
Fourth quarter operating income increased to $58.5 million, compared with $33.2 million for the same quarter last year, as a result of the intra-month price volatility, which resulted in increased sales volumes as we recycled storage.
