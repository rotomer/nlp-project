Tulsa, Okla. ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) today announced increased net income of $107.7 million for the first quarter of 2005 compared with $105.2 million for the same period in 2004. Earnings per diluted share of common stock were $0.97 for the first quarter of 2005, reflecting an increase in the number of shares used in the calculation. For the same period last year, the diluted earnings were $1.04 per share.
 
ONEOK's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Kyle said, "We have started 2005 with strong results and we reaffirm our 2005 annual earnings guidance in the range of $2.22 to $2.28 per diluted share of common stock.
 
"I am pleased that on April 21, 2005, we were able to increase our annual dividend 12 percent to $1.12 per share. In addition, as of March 31, we have repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program."

Late in the first quarter of 2005, we completed several successful wells and anticipate the production from these wells to have a positive impact on production volumes for the remainder of the year. However, we continue to see high demand for services involved with drilling, completion and production of wells, which may impact our ability to add reserves over the remainder of the year.
 
The following tables set forth hedging information for our Production segment for the remainder of 2005 and 2006. Our 2006 gas and oil production noted below is hedged using costless collars; therefore, the price realized will be between those ranges noted below.
 
 
The Production segment owns, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. This segment focuses on acquisition and development of reserves, rather than exploratory drilling.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income from our gathering and processing operations increased to $37.8 million in 2005, compared with $20.4 million in 2004. Our contract restructuring efforts continue to have a positive impact on operating income. The increases in operating income are due to:

The Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and marketing of natural gas liquids. The segment currently has approximately 1.8 Bcf/d of active processing capacity and approximately 13,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.
 
Transportation and Storage
 
Operating income from our transportation and storage operations was $14.2 million in 2005, compared with $13.5 million in 2004. The primary differences between the periods were:
 
 
 
 
The Transportation and Storage segment owns and operates intrastate pipelines and natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas storage and gas gathering facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Our facilities have a combined active working storage capacity of approximately 51.6 Bcf and approximately 5,600 miles of transportation pipeline with a maximum throughput of 2.9 Bcf/d.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income from our distribution operations was $80.6 million in 2005, compared with $85.7 million for 2004. The primary differences between periods were:
 
 
 
 
 
On January 28, 2005, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed for $99.4 million in rate relief in Oklahoma, which includes approximately $10.7 million of interim rate relief granted in January 2004. By statute, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has 180 days to review and rule on the request. Based on this schedule, an order from the Commission is expected in late July 2005.

The Distribution segment includes Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service Company and Texas Gas Service Company. We are the largest natural gas distributors in Kansas and Oklahoma and the third largest in Texas. Overall, we serve more than 2 million customers.
 
Energy Services
 
Operating income from our energy services operations was $52.3 million in 2005, compared with $63.4 million in 2004. The primary differences between periods were:
 
 
 
Based on the results of the first quarter, we now expect margins from our physical business to be approximately $123 million for 2005.
 
After the reorganization of our Energy Services segment in the third quarter of 2004, we began reporting the realized revenues and purchase costs of our non-trading activities on a gross basis. Prior periods have not been adjusted for this change. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact operating income, but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel.
 
The net margin for our energy services operations for the three months ended March 31, 2005, was derived from the following sources:
 
 
Our natural gas in storage on March 31, 2005, was 40 Bcf compared with 33 Bcf on March 31, 2004. Our total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 87 Bcf as of March 31, 2005, compared with 83 Bcf on March 31, 2004.
 
The Energy Services segment purchases, stores, transports and markets natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors in most states. Leased storage and transport capacity provide direct access to all regions of the country and flexibility in capturing volatility in the energy markets. The segment also trades natural gas.

ONEOK BUSINESS OUTLOOK
 
We reaffirm our previous annual earnings guidance for 2005 in the range of $2.22 to $2.28 per diluted share of common stock, which, as previously disclosed, does not include earnings from trading opportunities for the remainder of 2005. The 2004 reported results include trading earnings. Cash flow before changes in working capital is now expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by $140 to $150 million, which is reduced by $9 million as a result of the dividend increase announced on April 21, 2005.
