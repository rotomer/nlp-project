Any required filing of the Prospectus and any supplement thereto pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by such Rule 424(b).
 
Such counsel hereby further confirms to the Underwriters that, to such counsel's knowledge, there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as such, before or by any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (i) seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of the Agreement or the Securities, (ii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein, seek to challenge the legality or enforceability of any of the Documents filed, or required to be filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement, (iii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any documents incorporated by reference therein seek damages or other remedies with respect to any of the Documents filed, or required to be filed, as exhibits to the Registration Statement except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (iv) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek money damages in excess of 10% of the current assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (as set forth in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 filed with the Commission) or seek to impose criminal penalties upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or directors in their capacities as such and of which such counsel has knowledge, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company's business, or (v) except as set forth in or contemplated by the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, seek to enjoin any of the business activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions described in the Prospectus and of which such counsel has knowledge.
 
Such counsel has participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. From time to time in connection therewith such counsel has had discussions with (i) officers and representatives of the Company, (ii) representatives of KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accountants who examined certain of the financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and (iii) the Underwriters' representatives and counsel concerning the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. Such counsel has not independently verified and is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus except to the extent set forth in paragraphs (g) and (h) above. Based solely upon the participation and discussions described above, however, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when read collectively (except for the following as to which such counsel is not called upon to express a view (a) financial statements, schedules and other financial data contained in the
 
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein), (b) the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee on Form T-1, and (c) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" in the Prospectus as having been included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus on the authority of KPMG LLP as experts), as of the date thereof or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering the foregoing opinion, counsel may rely, to the extent they deem such reliance proper, on the opinions of other counsel to the Company as to matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and the State of Oklahoma, and as to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company and of government officials; provided that such counsel shall state that in such counsel's opinion that such counsel and the Underwriters are justified in relying on such opinions of other counsel. Copies of all such opinions and certificates shall be furnished to counsel to the Underwriters on the Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing opinion, we have relied upon a certificate of the Trustee under the Indenture as to authentication of the Securities. For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (k)(e) above, such counsel has reviewed only those statutes, rules and regulations, including regulatory rules and regulations, that in such counsel's experience are applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Agreement or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities. For purposes of the foregoing opinion, the term "knowledge" shall mean the conscious awareness of information by any Primary Lawyer, without undertaking any investigation. The term "Primary Lawyer" shall mean each lawyer in such counsel's Firm who gave substantive attention to representations of the Company in connection with the transaction described in the Prospectus.
 
Capitalized terms used in such opinion but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement, except the term "Subsidiaries" shall not include Northern Border Partners, L.P. or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or any subsidiaries listed on Schedule II to the Agreement as being organized under the laws of Mexico or Canada ("Excluded Subsidiaries") and counsel shall not be required to express any opinions regarding any Excluded Subsidiaries.

Re: ONEOK Notes Offering
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (Registration No. 82717) (the "Registration Statement") and the Prospectus Supplement, dated June 14, 2005 (the "Prospectus Supplement") of ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.20% Notes due 2015 (the "5.20% Notes") and $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.00% Notes due 2035 (the "6.00% Notes", and together with the 5.20% Notes, the "Securities").
 
As legal counsel to the Company for this transaction, we have examined and relied upon the originals or certified, conformed or reproduction copies of such agreements, instruments, documents, records and certificates of the Company, such certificates of public officials and such other documents, and have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion expressed below. We have examined, among other documents, the following:
 
(a) that certain Indenture dated December 28, 2001 between the Company and SunTrust Bank, a Georgia banking corporation (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated June 17, 2005 and a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated June 17, 2005 (collectively, the "Indenture");
 
(b) the Securities;
 
(c) that certain Underwriting Agreement dated June 14, 2005, between the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriting Agreement");
 
(d) the Secretary's Certificate of the Company dated June 17, 2005;
(e) a Certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma dated as of a date in June, 2005, as to the corporate existence and good standing of the Company;
 
(f) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto and related certificates (the "Certificate of Incorporation"); and
 
(g) the By-laws of the Company and all current amendments thereto (the "By-laws").
 
The Indenture, the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the "Note Documents."
 
In all such examinations, we have assumed without independent investigation or inquiry the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all signatures on original or certified copies, the authenticity of all original or certified copies and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies. We have relied as to factual matters upon, and have assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of officers of the Company delivered to us and certificates and other statements or information of or from public officials and officers and representatives of the Company.
 
To the extent it may be relevant to the opinions expressed herein, we have also assumed that: (i) none of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities violates New York law; (ii) the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities have each been duly executed and delivered by the Company to the extent such execution and delivery are questions of New York law; (iii) the Securities have been duly issued to the extent such issuance is a question of New York law; and (iv) the Securities have been duly authenticated by the Trustee.
 
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.
 
2. The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver, perform its obligations under, and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Note Documents.
 
3. The Note Documents have each been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
In rendering the foregoing opinions, our examination of matters of law has been limited to the laws of the state of Oklahoma and the federal laws of the United States of America as in effect on the date hereof. We undertake no, and hereby disclaim any,
obligation to advise you of any change in any of the matters set forth herein or in any matters upon which the opinions and views set forth in this letter are based.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Form 8-K dated July 17, 2005, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit.
