Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Aug. 1, 2005  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its second-quarter 2005 net income rose 40 percent from the same period a year earlier, primarily as a result of stronger natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil prices, and higher sales and transportation volumes.
 
Net income for the quarter was $24.9 million, or 23 cents per diluted share of common stock, compared with $17.8 million, or 17 cents per diluted share of common stock, for the same period a year earlier.
 
"We had extremely positive results in several of our segments, driven primarily by higher commodity prices, volumes and margins," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The gas processing spread continues to exceed the five-year average, contributing to our strong performance in our gathering and processing segment.
 
"Distribution segment results were lower due to higher labor and employee benefit costs, and lower margins from our retail and trading efforts reduced operating income in our energy services segment," Kyle stated.
 
For the six months, net income increased to $132.5 million, or $1.20 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $122.9 million, or $1.20 per diluted share of common stock, for the same period in 2004.
 
The company also announced that it is revising its 2005 earnings guidance. Based on certain assumptions regarding the potential sale of its oil and gas production operations, net earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.62 per diluted share of common stock. The revised guidance for income from continuing operations is in the range of $1.92 to $1.98 per diluted share of common stock. Revised guidance reflects the production segment's operating results as discontinued operations.
 
"Our updated earnings guidance for the remainder of 2005 includes anticipated operating income contributions from the natural gas liquids business we acquired from Koch on July 1, and implementation of a customer rate increase in Oklahoma on July 28," Kyle said.

In July, the company announced that it will begin a process that may result in the sale of its oil and gas production operations. If the company proceeds with the sale, it expects to complete the transaction sometime in the third quarter 2005.
 
The revised guidance does not include any additional margin for trading activities in the energy services segment. In March 2005, the company provided earnings guidance in the range of $2.22 to $2.28 per diluted share of common stock.

2005 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
 
Production
 
The production segment had second-quarter operating income of $16.5 million, versus $12.0 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement was primarily the result of higher commodity prices for natural gas and oil, and higher production volumes.
 
Operating income increased $8.0 million because of higher prices and volumes. The average natural gas price (net of hedges) received was $6.16 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), versus $5.04 per Mcf in the quarter a year earlier. Oil prices (net of hedges) were $45.76 per barrel, versus $27.93 per barrel in the second quarter last year. Natural gas production increased to 4,355 MMcf, compared with 4,060 MMcf in the second quarter last year. Oil production increased to 86 MBbls from 83 MBbls in the second quarter last year.
 
Operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, production and property taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization were $3.4 million higher in the quarter, compared with the same period last year. The operating expense increase was due to well workovers and new gathering facilities attributable to the company's Texas properties.

Year to date, the production segment had operating income of $30.1 million, versus $23.8 million in the same period a year earlier. Higher natural gas and oil prices, and higher production volumes added $9.8 million in the period, partially offset by higher operating costs.
 
The following table contains hedging information for the production segment for the remainder of 2005 and 2006.
 
 
In July, the company announced that it will begin a process that may result in the sale of its oil and natural gas production operations. If the company proceeds with the sale, it expects to complete the transaction sometime in the third quarter 2005.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
The gathering and processing segment's operating income for the second quarter was $41.7 million, compared with $27.3 million for the same period last year. Improved performance was driven by higher natural gas and NGL prices, higher natural gas volumes and wider gas processing spreads.
 
Operating income for the quarter increased $4.8 million as a result of higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices under the company's percent-of-proceeds contracts. The average price for natural gas in the quarter was $6.26 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu), versus $5.51 per MMBtu a year earlier. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on the company's product mix was $0.79 per gallon, versus $0.66 per gallon in the same period a year earlier.
 
Improvements in the gross processing spread, attributable to our keep-whole contracts, added $5.5 million to operating income from the prior year's quarter. The gross processing

spread in the quarter was $2.67 per MMBtu, versus $1.74 per MMBtu in the second quarter last year.
 
Operating income in the quarter also included an increase of $6.0 million, due primarily to higher natural gas and NGL sales volumes. Residue natural gas sales increased as certain natural gas producers elected to convert their contracts from keep whole to either fee or percent of proceeds. NGL sales were higher as a result of higher gas processing spreads, for ethane in particular.
 
For the first six months, operating income was $79.5 million, compared with $47.8 million a year earlier. The increase was due to higher natural gas and NGL prices, higher natural gas volumes, improvements in gross processing spreads and the addition of certain NGL storage and transportation agreements associated with the company's natural gas liquids operations in Conway, Kan.
 
Operating costs increased in the second quarter and first half of the year. The increase was primarily caused by higher environmental and safety expenditures, primarily related to new storage rules and regulations, and higher costs for materials and chemicals used for compressor operation and maintenance.
 
The following table contains margin information for the time periods indicated. NGL shrink, plant fuel and condensate shrink refer to the Btus that are removed from natural gas through the gathering and processing operation.

Pipelines and Storage
 
The pipelines and storage segment, formerly called transportation and storage, reported operating income of $14.7 million in the second quarter, compared with $11.1 million for the same period last year. The improved results came from higher transportation volumes and increased storage volumes and rates.
 
In the quarter, storage margins increased $1.8 million from improved pricing for inter- and intra-month business. Margins from natural gas transportation services increased $1.7 million due to improved fuel position caused by higher storage and transportation volumes, and higher natural gas prices. Increased transportation revenues from higher throughput, due to more favorable weather conditions for transportation, added $0.9 million of operating income, compared with the same quarter last year.
 
For the first six months, operating income was $28.8 million, versus $24.6 million in the same period last year. Storage margins improved $1.3 million, as a result of the improved pricing environment for storage activity. Natural gas transportation margins increased $1.5 million due to improved fuel position, which resulted from higher storage and transportation volumes, and higher natural gas prices, versus the same period a year earlier. Increased transportation revenues from higher throughput, due to more favorable weather conditions for transportation, added $1.3 million to operating income, compared with the same period last year.

Energy Services
 
Energy services posted operating income of $2.9 million in the second quarter, versus $4.9 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the six months was $55.2 million, versus $68.3 for the same period last year.
 
Net margin for the quarter declined to $12.6 million, compared with $14.3 million for the same period a year earlier, due primarily to the net impact of:
 
 
 
 
 
Net margin for the six months was $74.6 million, versus $89.6 million for the same period last year. A margin reduction of $20.4 million was due primarily to a decrease in storage activity caused by fewer heating-degree days in the first quarter of 2005, partially offset by an increase in demand fees associated with the company's long-term contracts. Favorable natural gas basis spreads between the Rocky Mountains and Mid-continent regions increased transportation margins by $6.5 million. Operating costs for the six-month period declined by $2.0 million, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.
 
On June 30, 2005, natural gas in storage was 59.0 Bcf, compared with 58.9 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf on June 30, 2005.
 
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
 
 
Distribution
 
The distribution segment reported an operating loss of $7.0 million, compared with a $2.7 million operating loss in the second quarter last year. Net margin increased by $2.5 million, due

primarily to increased customer usage and property tax recovery. However, margin increases were more than offset by labor and employee benefit cost increases of $2.1 million, and bad debt cost increases of $0.6 million. The segment also had a write-off of $2.9 million for the replacement of a field customer service system in Texas.
 
For the six-month period, operating income was $73.6 million, compared with $83.0 million a year earlier. This decrease included net operating cost increases of $2.3 million  primarily increased labor and employee benefit costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by $2.1 million in reduced bad debt expenses. In addition, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased by $7.8 million, primarily due to the $2.9 million write-off for the replacement of a field customer service system in Texas, higher amortization of property tax recovery in Kansas and higher depreciation related to additional plant and equipment investments.
 
GUIDANCE
 
The company is updating its segment operating income estimates and quarterly earnings per share guidance.
 
Segment operating income estimates will change from those announced earlier in the year as a result of the acquisition of the Koch natural gas liquids business and the related transfer of certain operations into different operating segments, the increased 2005 operating income contribution from the recently implemented rate increase in Oklahoma in the distribution segment, the impact of the potential sale of the company's oil and natural gas producing operations, and higher interest expenses.
 
"While we still expect the Koch acquisition to generate approximately $135-145 million of primarily fee-based earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2006, the EBITDA contribution for the second half of 2005 is expected to be $59-62 million," Kyle stated. "The full benefits of renegotiated contracts and additional volumes connected to the system will not be realized until 2006."
 
With the completion of the acquisition, the company formed a new operating segment, called natural gas liquids. It consists of the company's existing NGL marketing business, currently part of the gathering and processing segment, and the businesses acquired from Koch excluding those assets regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which will be part of the company's pipelines and storage segment. VESCO Holdings, also acquired as part of the transaction, will be included in the gathering and processing segment.
 
In July, the company announced that it will begin a process that may result in the sale of its oil and natural gas production operations. If the company proceeds with the sale, it expects to complete the transaction sometime in the third quarter 2005. The company's 2005 guidance reflects this segment's operating results as discontinued operations.

UPDATED SEGMENT ESTIMATES
 
The updated segment income statement, capital expenditure forecasts and cash flow forecast projections for 2005 are included in Attachment I. Following are the changes.
 
Production
 
The company's 2005 guidance reflects the production segment's operating results as discontinued operations, as if the potential sale of its natural gas and oil companies is completed. The company estimates that the sale will result in a gain from the sale of discontinued operations (net of taxes) of $42 million.
 
In calculating the estimated gain on the sale of discontinued operations, the company used the following assumptions: year-end 2004 proved reserves of 228 billion cubic feet of energy equivalent; an assumed sales price for reserves of $2.00 per thousand cubic feet of energy equivalent; a closing date of Sept. 30, 2005.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Gathering and processing's operating income is projected to be $130 million, compared with a previous estimate of $150 million. This change is primarily the result of the transfer of NGL marketing from this segment into the newly formed natural gas liquids segment, created as a result of the Koch acquisition, offset partially by the addition of VESCO Holdings, which was part of the Koch acquisition, to this segment.
 
Pipelines and storage
 
Pipeline and storage's operating income is now estimated to be $65 million, compared with the previous estimates of $50 million. The change is due to the transfer of FERC-regulated assets from the Koch acquisition into the pipelines and storage segment.
 
Natural Gas Liquids
 
This new segment's operating income is projected to be $43 million. It includes Koch assets with the exception of FERC-regulated assets, which are now part of pipelines and storage, and ONEOK natural gas liquids marketing, which was part of gathering and processing.
 
Energy Services
 
Operating income is projected at $131 million, unchanged from the previous forecast. The revised guidance does not include any additional margin for trading activities in this segment for the remainder of 2005.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income is forecast at $113 million, versus a previous forecast of $112 million. The forecast includes an additional $3.7 million in 2005 operating income contribution from the recently implemented $58 million annual rate increase in Oklahoma, partially offset by higher employee costs. The 2005 impact of the rate increase on operating income is $21.7 million.

Other issues
 
Interest expense is now forecast at $144 million, compared with previous estimates of $108 million. The higher interest expense is the result of recently completed long-term financing, higher levels of working capital, higher short-term interest rates and additional debt associated with the financing of the natural gas liquids acquisition.
 
The revised forecast assumes that the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the company's natural gas and oil operations are used to reduce short-term debt and related interest expense.
 
The acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets is expected to add approximately $20 million of depreciation expense, which is now estimated to be $220 million for 2005. Deferred taxes are estimated to be $65 million.
