-- Oct. 4, 2005--ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has issued a final order on the company's Oklahoma Natural Gas Company division's application for a rate increase.
TULSA, Okla.
The Corporation Commission unanimously approved an annual rate increase of $57.5 million.
Last January, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company filed an application with the Commission for a rate increase of $99.4 million in additional annual revenue.
In July, the Commission's administrative law judge who heard the case recommended an increase in annual revenues of approximately $58 million. Oklahoma Natural Gas implemented new rates on July 28, 2005, based on the judge's report, acting under state law that allows a utility to revise its rates at the end of a 180-day period in the absence of a final order.
Today's order will have no substantial impact on customers' bills.
