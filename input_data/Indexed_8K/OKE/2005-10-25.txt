TULSA, Okla.  Oct. 21, 2005  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that it is raising its third-quarter and full-year 2005 earnings guidance, and releasing its preliminary 2006 earnings guidance.
 
"Each of our businesses performed well in the third quarter. We saw higher commodity prices, volumes and margins, and improved gas processing spreads," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our energy services segment turned in exceptional performance, benefiting from increased natural gas storage activity and wider basis spreads. The newly acquired natural gas liquids segment continues to perform as expected," he added.
 
Third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of 47 cents to 51 cents per diluted share of common stock, compared with previous guidance of 4 cents per diluted share.
 
The company now expects third-quarter net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.71 per diluted share of common stock due to the improved operating performance, and the gain on the sale of the production business and the loss on the sale of the power plant announced today, both of which are reflected in discontinued operations. Previous third-quarter earnings guidance was 51 cents per diluted share.
 
The company will release its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2, 2005. A conference call will be held on Nov. 3, 2005, at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (10 a.m. Central Standard Time). To participate in the call, dial 888-639-6218, pass code 787415 or log on to ONEOK's Web site, www.oneok.com.
 
The company is also raising its full-year 2005 guidance to be in the range of $4.92 to $4.96 per diluted share of common stock and earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.59 to $3.63 per diluted share. Year-end projections include a $162 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, after-tax gain on the previously announced sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets, which is expected to close in Dec.1, 2005. The gain will be recorded in income from continuing operations as other income in the fourth quarter.
 
The company previously provided net earnings guidance in the range of $2.56 to $2.62 per diluted share of common stock, and guidance for income from continuing operations of $1.92 to $1.98 per diluted share for 2005.
 
The company also announced its preliminary 2006 earnings guidance of $1.97 to 2.03 per diluted share of common stock.
 
"Our preliminary guidance for 2006 reflects our current view for the year and includes the full-year benefits of renegotiated contracts and additional volumes connected to the natural gas liquids assets we acquired July 1, 2005. We also incorporated the recently implemented $57.5 million annual rate increase in Oklahoma," said

Kyle. "Higher employee benefit costs are anticipated, and we have reflected the effects of the scheduled conversion of our equity units in February 2006," he stated.
 
The company also announced that it has signed an agreement to sell its Spring Creek power plant located in southwest Logan County, Okla. to Westar Energy, Inc. for $53 million. Westar will purchase the 300-megawatt gas-fired merchant power plant that was built in 2001 to supply electrical power during peak periods using gas-powered turbine generators.
 
As a result of this transaction, ONEOK will record a third-quarter loss in discontinued operations of approximately $34 million or 31 cents per diluted share.
 
"With the completion of this transaction, we are exiting the power-generation business. We evaluated several alternatives and concluded a sale is the best option," said Kyle.
 
ONEOK plans to use the proceeds from the power plant sale to reduce short-term debt. After-tax cash proceeds are estimated to be $61 million. The transaction requires Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval and is expected to be completed in 2006.
 
2005 UPDATED GUIDANCE
 
The updated segment income statement, capital expenditure forecasts and cash flow forecast projections for 2005 are included in Attachment I. Following are the changes.
 
Production
 
The company's updated 2005 guidance reflects the production segment's operating results as discontinued operations. The sale of this segment in September 2005 resulted in an after-tax gain of $151 million, or $1.39 per diluted share of common stock, which is reported as discontinued operations.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Gathering and processing's operating income is projected to remain $130 million. Higher margins will offset the operating income reduction from the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets, which is currently scheduled to close Dec. 1, 2005.
 
As a result of the sale of the Texas properties, the company now estimates that its volume-weighted contract mix will be 46 percent, fee based; 39 percent, percent of proceeds (POP); and 15 percent, keep-whole. Keep-whole contracts with conditioning language increase to 34 percent. The Texas properties contract mix was approximately 75 percent, POP; and 25 percent, keep-whole.
 
Pipelines and Storage
 
Pipeline and storage's operating income is now estimated to be $75 million, compared with the previous estimates of $65 million, primarily due to increased throughput related to demand associated with warmer than anticipated weather, along with improved pricing and fuel position.
 
Natural Gas Liquids
 
Natural gas liquids operating income forecast remains $43 million.
 
Energy Services
 
Operating income is projected at $145 million versus $131 million from the previous forecast, primarily due to increased prices, more sales from storage and transportation basis gains. The revised guidance does not include any margin for additional trading activities in this segment for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income is forecast at $111 million versus a previous forecast of $113 million. The reduction is due to higher employee benefit costs.

Other issues
 
Interest expense is now forecast at $142 million, compared with previous estimates of $144 million. Interest expense is affected by the recently completed long-term financing, higher levels of working capital, higher short-term interest rates and additional debt associated with the financing of the natural gas liquids acquisition, offset by the proceeds from the asset sales.
 
As of Dec. 31, 2005, the company estimates that long-term debt  treating the equity units that convert in February 2006 as equity  will be approximately 52 percent of total capitalization.
 
PRELIMINARY 2006 GUIDANCE
 
The segment income statement, capital expenditure forecasts and cash flow forecast projections for 2006 are included in Attachment II.
 
Gathering and Processing
 
Operating income is estimated to be $88 million, which reflects the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets that were estimated to contribute $52 million on an annual basis.
 
The company expects commodity prices for the natural gas liquids (NGLs) and the gas sold under percent-of-proceeds contract to be higher in 2006. However, based on current price projections, the company anticipates a lower keep-whole spread than in 2005, but in line with the three-year average of $1.78 per MMBtu.
 
2006 guidance reflects the company's continued restructuring of unprofitable natural gas contracts, along with the addition of conditioning language that provides a floor related to unfavorable gas processing spreads under keep-whole contracts. Wellhead natural gas volumes are expected to remain constant.
 
Pipelines and Storage
 
Pipelines and storage operating income is estimated at $85 million in 2006, based on a slight increase in throughput and the benefit of the recently acquired FERC-regulated NGL distribution pipelines for a full year.
 
Natural Gas Liquids
 
Natural gas liquids operating income is estimated at $93 million, reflecting the positive effect of renegotiated contracts and additional contracted volumes. This forecast is in line with previously announced estimates of approximately $135-145 million of primarily fee-based earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the assets acquired July 1, 2005, which are included in this segment and in the pipelines and storage segment.
 
Energy Services
 
Energy services operating income is estimated at $125 million, reflecting continued strong marketing activity, complemented by the company's storage and transportation position and continued natural gas price volatility.
 
Distribution
 
Operating income in the distribution segment is expected to be $119 million, reflecting the full-year impact of the recently approved $57.5 million rate increase in Oklahoma. The revenue increases will be somewhat offset by higher employee-related costs, partially due to an assumed lower discount rate used to calculate certain employee-benefit costs and higher bad debt expense as the result of higher projected natural gas prices.
