Item 9.01
Financial Statements and Exhibits

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 2, 2005  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its third-quarter 2005 net income rose significantly as a result of stronger performance in each of its operating segments and the sale of its production unit.
 
Net income for the quarter was $184.5 million, or $1.70 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $20.8 million, or 19 cents per diluted share of common stock, for the same period a year earlier. Income from continuing operations in the quarter was $52.7 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, versus $16.6 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, for the same period a year earlier.
 
Third-quarter results include a net after-tax gain of $151.4 million, or $1.39 per diluted share of common stock, from the sale of the company's oil and gas production business, partially offset by a $32.9 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, loss from discontinued operations related to the sale of the company's Spring Creek power plant in Oklahoma.
 
"Our acquisition of natural gas liquids assets at the beginning of the quarter, coupled with higher prices, volumes and margins, all contributed to our exceptional operating performance," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer.
 
"Earnings also improved because of the implementation of new rates in Oklahoma, which contributed to our distribution segment's performance. Gas processing spreads showed improvement, which also positively affected our gathering and processing segment," said Kyle.
 
"While all of our businesses improved in the quarter, our energy services segment posted significant gains related to natural gas marketing and storage activity, and increases in transportation and storage basis spreads," Kyle added.
 
Operating costs for the quarter increased primarily because of costs related to the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets and increased employee benefit costs.

For the nine months, net income increased to $317.1 million, or $2.89 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $143.8 million, or $1.38 per diluted share of common stock, for the same period in 2004. Income from continuing operations for the nine-month period was $171.5 million, or $1.56 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $130.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share in the year-earlier period.
 
On Oct. 11, 2005, the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its natural gas gathering and processing assets in Texas for $528 million. The transaction is expected to close Dec. 1, 2005, and the company will record an estimated after-tax gain of $162 million, or $1.49 per diluted share of common stock. The gain will be recorded in income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. These assets represent the smallest geographical region in terms of throughput; are the least integrated with other ONEOK entities; and represent the company's most significant exposure to keep-whole contracts without conditioning language.
 
On Oct. 21, 2005, the company increased its third-quarter and full-year 2005 earnings guidance and provided preliminary 2006 guidance. The after-tax proceeds from the Texas gathering and processing sale of $356 million were reflected as a reduction of short-term debt; however the company may purchase other assets or repurchase ONEOK shares.

2005 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
 
Gathering and Processing
 
The gathering and processing segment's operating income for the third quarter was $39.3 million, compared with $34.0 million for the same period last year. Improved performance was driven by favorable commodity pricing for natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL), and wider gas processing spreads, offset somewhat by the segment's hedging activities.
 
Net margin for the quarter was $80.0 million, compared with $74.1 million a year earlier. The company's ongoing efforts to successfully renegotiate under-performing gas purchase, gas processing and gathering contracts continue to positively impact net margin.
 
Net margin for the quarter increased $8.3 million as a result of higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices under the company's percent-of-proceeds (POP) contracts, net of hedging activities. These increases were offset by a margin decrease of $1.5 million due to less volume processed as a result of natural production declines and contract expirations.
 
The average mid-continent price for natural gas in the quarter was $7.35 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) versus $5.43 per MMBtu a year earlier. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on the company's product mix was $0.98 per gallon, versus $0.76 per gallon in the same period a year earlier.
 
The resulting gross processing spread in the quarter was $3.62 per MMBtu versus $3.07 per MMBtu in the third quarter last year; however it had a minimal impact on margins because of hedging activities.
 
Operating costs for the quarter increased slightly, primarily due to higher compressor maintenance and employee costs.
 
For the nine months, operating income was $109.9 million, compared with $77.7 million a year earlier. Net margin was $227.1 million versus $188.9 in the nine-month period last year.
 
Net margin improvements include a $21.5 million increase due to higher natural gas and NGL prices on percent-of-proceeds contracts, net of hedges, a $12.0 million increase attributable to keep-whole contracts primarily caused by higher gross processing spreads, net of hedges, and a $6.1 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume increases as certain producers elected to convert their contracts from keep-whole to either fee or POP.
 
Operating costs increased in the nine-month period, primarily due to $1.7 million in compressor maintenance and employee costs.

Natural Gas Liquids
 
The natural gas liquids segment had third-quarter operating income of $17.5 million, compared with $7.3 million in the same quarter a year earlier. The company did experience some lost revenue caused by the hurricane-related shutdown of MB-1, the fractionator in which it holds an 80 percent interest. These lost revenues were more than offset by gains in the company's optimization efforts  where it was able to take advantage of price differences between Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas  and increased margins from its isomerization operation.
 
Net margins for the quarter were $37.9 million, compared with $10.3 million a year earlier. The increase results from the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets on July 1, 2005, which contributed a net margin increase of $27.2 million. In the quarter, storage margins increased $1.1 million due to restructured storage contracts.
 
Operating cost increases of $11.2 million and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $5.0 million were related to the acquisition.
 
Operating income for the nine months was $26.4 million, compared with $11.4 million a year earlier. Net margin for the nine-month period was $52.2 million versus $18.4 million last year. The acquisition of the NGL assets added $27.2 million in margin for the nine months. Restructured contracts added $4.8 million in higher storage margins in the period. Net margin also increased $1.9 million due to higher marketing fees related to higher NGL prices.
 
Operating costs increased by $11.2 million related to the newly acquired assets. Depletion, depreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million related to the acquisition. Storage regulatory compliance costs increased $2.0 million in the nine-month period.
 
In the third quarter, the company added approximately 15,000 barrels per day of NGLs to its system, which was anticipated at the time of the acquisition. The company is currently in negotiations with several processing plant operators that could add another 20,000 barrels per day to its system in 2006, which have not been reflected in the company's 2006 guidance.

Pipelines and Storage
 
The pipelines and storage segment reported operating income of $24.0 million in the third quarter, compared with $11.8 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of the natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines on July 1, 2005, and an increase in natural gas throughput caused by higher natural gas demand from power plants due to warmer weather.
 
Net margin in the third quarter was $50.9 million, compared with $28.4 million in the quarter a year earlier. The acquisition of natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines added $13.9 to net margin. Additionally, third-quarter margins from natural gas transportation services increased $6.9 million due to improved fuel position caused by higher transportation volumes related to more favorable weather conditions, higher natural gas prices and improved fuel position. Storage margins improved $2.6 million as a result of higher revenues from renegotiated contracts and increased storage activities caused by improved pricing for inter- and intra-month business, improved fuel position and higher commodity prices.
 
Margins from natural gas liquids pipelines were reduced because of power outages along the Texas Gulf Coast that affected pumping stations, caused by Hurricane Rita, but were more than offset by increased throughput on the company's natural gas pipelines.
 
Operating costs increased $7.2 million in the third quarter, including $5.4 million related to the acquisition and the balance associated with higher regulatory compliance and employee-related costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $3.0 million in the quarter, primarily related to operating the newly acquired NGL pipelines.
 
For the first nine months, operating income was $52.9 million versus $36.4 million in the same period last year. Net margins were $112.2 million versus $85.4 million in the nine-month period last year. $13.9 million of the margin increase was related to the acquisition of the natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines. Additionally, margins from natural gas transportation services increased $9.0 million due to improved fuel position caused by higher transportation volumes related to more favorable weather conditions, higher natural gas prices and improved fuel position. Storage margins improved $4.4 million as a result of higher revenues from renegotiated contracts, increased storage activities caused by improved pricing for inter- and intra-month business, improved fuel position and higher natural gas prices.
 
Operating costs increased $7 million, primarily related to a $5.4 million increase associated with the acquisition, with the balance related to higher regulatory compliance and employee costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $3.3 million in the nine-month period, primarily related to operating the newly acquired NGL pipelines.
 
Energy Services
 
The energy services segment posted operating income of $55.2 million in the third quarter versus $10.8 million in the same period last year. Net margin for the quarter increased to $68.2 million, compared with $18.1 million for the same period a year earlier. Margins were $54.6 million higher due to increased marketing and storage activity caused by higher margins

from selling natural gas from storage and marketing monthly gas, and margins associated with an increase in basis spreads associated with storage and transportation activities. Power margins increased $5.3 million due to improved Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market heat rates caused by an increase in cooling-degree days. Financial trading margins decreased $10.3 million, compared with the third quarter a year earlier.
 
Operating costs for the quarter increased by $5.6 million, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and increased legal expense.
 
Operating income for the nine months was $110.8 million versus $80.1 million in the same period a year earlier. Net margin for the nine months was $140.7 million versus $105.9 million for the same period last year. It included a $29.6 million improvement from increased marketing and storage activity, partially offset by lower sales from storage in the first quarter, and a $4.9 million increase in power margins related to improved ERCOT market heat rates attributable to more cooling-degree days. Net margin in the nine-month period also increased $5.9 million due to mark-to-market earnings associated with derivative contracts used to hedge physical transportation activities. Margins also increased $6.6 million in the nine months as a result of optimizing transportation agreements associated with wider basis differentials. These increases were reduced by $9.0 million in lower margins from natural gas options trading in the nine months and by a $2.3 million decline in retail margins in the second quarter.
 
Operating costs for the nine-month period increased by $3.7 million, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and increased legal expense.
 
On Sept. 30, 2005, natural gas in storage was 63.9 Bcf, compared with 79.1 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas in storage on Oct. 31, 2005, was 75.6 Bcf at a weighted average cost of less than $7.55 per MMBtu. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf on Sept. 30, 2005.
 
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
 
 
Distribution
 
The distribution segment reported an operating loss of $12.8 million, compared with a $17.6 million loss in the third quarter last year. Net margin was $105.1 million in the third

quarter versus $88.6 million in the same period a year earlier, due primarily to $14.9 million in increased margin from implementation of new rates in Oklahoma.
 
Operating costs increased $11.9 million, primarily as a result of $8.4 million in higher labor and employee benefit costs, a $2.0 million increase in property taxes in Kansas and an accrual of an insurance deductible related to damage sustained to our Texas distribution operations as a result of Hurricane Rita.
 
For the nine-month period, operating income was $60.8 million, compared with $65.4 million a year earlier. Net margin was $412.8 million, compared with $395.6 million in the 2004 nine-month period.
 
The net margin increase was due primarily to $14.9 million in increased margin from implementation of new rates in Oklahoma, and $2.6 million during the time frame a limited issue filing was in affect in Oklahoma.
 
Operating costs increased $14.2 million, driven primarily by a $13.2 million increase in labor and employee benefit costs and an accrual of an insurance deductible related to Hurricane Rita. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased due to a $2.9 million charge to replace a field customer service system in Texas and a $3.8 million increase in amortization of property tax recovery in Kansas, which is offset by increased revenues.
