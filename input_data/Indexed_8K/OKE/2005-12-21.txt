TULSA, Okla. -- Dec. 21, 2005 -- The ONEOK Foundation announced today that it will donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.
"This year, we have seen rapidly rising energy prices, and we know that, for some, paying high energy bills can create a hardship," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are pleased that with this donation the ONEOK Foundation is able to help people in need."
The funds will be available primarily through established energy assistance programs. Individuals should contact ONEOK's community partners -- The Salvation Army in Oklahoma, designated agents from individual counties through the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, and The Salvation Army in Kansas -- for more information.
ONEOK is headquartered in Tulsa, Okla., and employs nearly 5,000 people. Through its three distribution companies -- Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service -- ONEOK provides natural gas service to more than two million customers.
