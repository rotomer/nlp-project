Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 15, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) and Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NYSE: NBP) today announced a series of transactions expected to increase shareholder and unit holder value and facilitate additional growth opportunities for both companies. Following completion of the transactions, ONEOK will own 45.7 percent of Northern Border Partners and 100 percent of the general partner interest.
In addition, ONEOK and Northern Border Partners are increasing their estimated 2006 earnings guidance in anticipation of the closing of the transactions.
The Northern Border Partners policy committee announced that after closing of the transactions, it intends to consider an increase of $0.13 to $0.15 per unit in the quarterly distributions to unit holders. Depending on the timing of the closing, a portion of that increase could be included in the first-quarter distribution, which will be payable in May.
The Transactions
In separate transactions, ONEOK, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Northern Plains Natural Gas Company, will purchase TransCanada Corporation's 17.5 percent general partner interest in Northern Border Partners, increasing ONEOK's ownership of the general partner interest to 100 percent, for $40 million, less $10 million for expenses associated with the transfer of operating responsibility of the Northern Border Pipeline Company to TransCanada for a net payment of $30 million.
ONEOK will transfer to Northern Border Partners its entire gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments in a transaction valued at approximately $3 billion. Included in the sale are the natural gas liquids assets purchased from Koch Industries, which ONEOK will sell to Northern Border Partners for $1.35 billion, the price it paid to Koch in July 2005.
ONEOK will receive approximately $1.35 billion in cash and approximately 36.5 million limited partner units. The limited partner units and the related general partner interest contribution are valued at approximately $1.65 billion. The actual number of units issued was determined by using the

average closing price of the Northern Border Partners common units for the 20 trading days prior to this announcement.
For financial reporting purposes, the transfer of the assets to Northern Border Partners will be accounted for at the historical cost basis of the assets being transferred, and accordingly there will be no goodwill to Northern Border Partners or gain to ONEOK recorded for the transaction.
ONEOK's projected 2006 operating income for the segments being transferred was $266 million and was included in its 2006 earnings guidance issued on Oct. 21, 2005. Depreciation was estimated at $80 million.
Northern Border Partners will sell to TC PipeLines, LP, a publicly traded partnership affiliated with TransCanada, a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company for approximately $300 million. The price of the 20 percent interest, along with the related share of Northern Border Pipeline's outstanding debt, totals $420 million. All cash distributions paid by Northern Border Pipeline in 2006 will be split equally between Northern Border Partners and TC PipeLines.
Following completion of the sale, Northern Border Partners and TC PipeLines LP will each own a 50 percent interest in the pipeline, with an affiliate of TransCanada becoming operator of the pipeline in April 2007.
Based on 2006 earnings guidance issued by Northern Border Partners on Nov. 2, 2005, projected operating income and depreciation for 2006 related to the 20 percent of Northern Border Pipeline being sold are approximately $36 million and $12 million, respectively.
"These transactions deliver both immediate and long-term value to ONEOK and Northern Border Partners, and position both companies for future growth," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "ONEOK will have an expanded ownership position in a larger, more diversified master limited partnership with an increased capacity to grow."
"The combination of Northern Border Partners' acquisition of ONEOK's midstream assets and the sale of 20 percent of Northern Border Pipeline are expected to be immediately accretive to our distributable cash flow," said William Cordes, chief executive officer of Northern Border Partners. "With these additional assets and the associated increases in cash flow, we hope to be able to increase our indicated annualized distribution to unit holders by approximately $0.55 to $3.75 by the end of the year."
The Northern Border Partners' audit committee, which is comprised of independent members, determined the fairness of the transactions. The audit committee engaged independent legal counsel and an independent financial adviser to assist in its determination.
Upon completion of these transactions, ONEOK will own approximately 37.0 million limited partner units, which, combined with the general partnership interest acquired from TransCanada, will increase its total interest in Northern Border Partners to 45.7 percent.

Closing of the transactions is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, including antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and is expected to be completed by April 1, 2006.
Benefits to ONEOK
"These transactions provide clear benefit to ONEOK and its shareholders," Kyle added. "We are selling the assets at current market valuations and expect to have more clarity on the value of our remaining portfolio of businesses  the three local gas distribution companies, our energy services business and our 45.7 percent investment in Northern Border Partners. As the general partner and a significant unit holder in Northern Border Partners, ONEOK's shareholders will also participate in the future growth of Northern Border Partners," Kyle said. "At the indicated potential annual distribution level, we could exceed the maximum general partner incentive distribution target," he concluded.
ONEOK intends to use $40 million of the $1.35 billion cash proceeds from the sale to Northern Border Partners to acquire the general partnership interest from TransCanada. The remainder will be used to reduce short-term debt, acquire other assets or repurchase ONEOK common stock.
Benefits to Northern Border Partners
Northern Border Partners will initially fund the cash portion of the acquisition with the proceeds from the sale of the 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline and bridge financing. Northern Border Partners expects its total debt-to-capitalization to improve to approximately 45 percent after completion of the transaction, compared with approximately 57 percent currently.
"In addition to improving our ability to increase distributions to unit holders, the acquisitions also provide us with a stronger balance sheet, with additional capacity to fund future growth," Cordes said. "Adding these assets to our existing base will provide us with a larger and more diversified portfolio that will provide more opportunities for organic growth."
Unit Transactions
The limited partner units issued to ONEOK initially will be a newly created Class B unit with the same distribution rights as the outstanding common units, but will have limited voting rights and will be subordinated related to cash distributions to the common units. Distributions on the Class B units will be prorated from the date of issuance.
Northern Border Partners will hold a special election for holders of common units as soon as practical, but within 12 months of issuing the Class B units to approve the conversion of the Class B units into common units and to approve certain amendments to the partnership agreement. The proposed amendments grant voting rights for common units held by the general partner if a vote is held to remove the general partner and require fair market value compensation for the general partner interest if the general partner is removed.

If the common unit holders do not approve the conversion and amendments, the Class B unit distribution rights would increase to 115 percent of the distributions paid on the common units.
Consolidation
As previously disclosed, under new accounting requirements, effective Jan. 1, 2006, ONEOK, as general partner for Northern Border Partners, will report Northern Border Partners' results on a consolidated basis in ONEOK's financial statements. A consolidating income statement and balance sheet, based on the revised 2006 guidance, are attached to this release as Attachments III and IV, respectively.
As a result of its sale of the 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline, Northern Border Partners will report the pipeline's results on the equity method of accounting and therefore, will no longer report the pipeline's results on a consolidated basis. The change would be effective Jan. 1, 2006.
Increased 2006 Guidance  ONEOK (Attachments I, III and IV)
As reflected in Attachment I, ONEOK is increasing its 2006 earnings guidance, which was originally disclosed on Oct. 21, 2005, to reflect the transactions, as well as higher expected results from its energy services segment and lower employee benefit costs.
For 2006, the company expects net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.29 per diluted share. Previous guidance was $1.97 to $2.03 per diluted share.
Attachment III has been provided to compare ONEOK's original 2006 guidance with the revised ONEOK guidance before consolidation of Northern Border Partners and provide reconciliations to consolidated net income.
As reflected in Attachment III, operating income for the segments sold to Northern Border Partners has been removed from the ONEOK guidance after April 1, 2006, when the transactions are expected to close.
Energy services operating income estimates have been increased to $170 million from $135 million to reflect higher seasonal natural gas spreads and increased basis differentials on transportation capacity.
Other income of $160.5 million is related to ONEOK's equity earnings from Northern Border Partners. Included in this amount is $49.4 million related to ONEOK's share of the gain on the sale of 20 percent of Northern Border Pipeline.
General and administrative expenses have been reduced by approximately $16.0 million, due to projected increases in employee benefit costs being lower than anticipated, anticipated synergies and the reallocation of overhead to Northern Border Partners due to the transactions.

Based on the use of the cash proceeds to reduce short-term debt, interest expense has been lowered to $108 million from ONEOK's initial guidance of $147 million.
ONEOK projects that its long-term debt will be 46 percent of capitalization at Dec. 31, 2006, as reflected in Attachment IV.
Increased 2006 Guidance  Northern Border Partners (Attachment II)
With the anticipated closing of these transactions, Northern Border Partners is updating its 2006 financial guidance, which was originally disclosed on Nov. 2, 2005. Changes in the partnership's financial guidance are the result of the transactions announced today and assume a closing date of April 1, 2006.
Net income for 2006 is now expected to range from $426 million to $446 million, or $4.43 to $4.69 per unit. Net income is expected to include a one-time gain of $108 million, or $1.44 per unit, on the sale of the 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline. Distributable cash flow is expected to be in the range of $324 million to $344 million, or $3.96 to $4.23 per unit.

ONEOK's adviser on the transaction was UBS Investment Bank. The Northern Border Partners' audit committee was advised by Lehman Brothers, Inc.
