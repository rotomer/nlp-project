TULSA, Okla. -- Feb. 28, 2006 -- For the first time, ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) has been recognized as one of the most admired companies in the United States in 2006 by FORTUNE Magazine.
ONEOK ranked number two among energy companies surveyed -- in a virtual "dead heat" for first place -- and was the top Oklahoma-based company on the FORTUNE Magazine list.
"This is quite an accomplishment. All employees should be proud of this honor, especially since this is the first year we've been considered," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"Without the dedication and commitment of our 4,560 employees to make this a great company, this recognition would not have been possible," Kyle stated.
In the energy industry category, ONEOK ranked number one in use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management, and quality of products and services; number two in employee talent, financial soundness and long-term investment; and number three in innovation.
The annual corporate reputation report card, conducted by Hay Partners on behalf of FORTUNE magazine, surveys more than 600 companies in 70 industries. It asks executives, directors and analysts to rate companies on eight criteria -- innovation, employee talent, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management, financial soundness, long-term investment and quality of products and services.
