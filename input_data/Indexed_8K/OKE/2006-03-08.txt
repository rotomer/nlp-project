Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  March 8, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that it is reducing its year-end 2005 financial results and increasing its 2006 guidance.
The earnings revision is related to a software error that affected the timing of the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are accounted for as hedges in the company's energy services segment during 2005. These amounts are recorded as cost of sales and fuel in the company's consolidated statement of income.
The company uses third-party software to account for its derivative hedging instruments. The recently discovered software error reduces 2005 net income by $8.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share of common stock, and energy services operating income by $13.2 million. This adjustment relates to the company's third-quarter 2005 earnings and does not affect fourth-quarter 2005 results. The decrease in net income in 2005 will be recognized as additional earnings during the first quarter of 2006 as the hedging instruments settle.
As a result, the company is raising its 2006 guidance in its energy services segment to $183 million from $170 million, which will result in revised company guidance in the range of $2.30 to $2.36 per diluted share of common stock.
Revised 2005 net income was $546.6 million, or $5.06 per diluted share, compared with $242.2 million, or $2.30 per diluted share of common stock in 2004. Revised 2005 income from continuing operations was $403.1 million, or $3.73 per diluted share, compared with 2004 income from continuing operations of $224.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share.
Revised 2006 earnings guidance exhibit is attached as Attachment I.
Revised 2005 financial statements are attached as Attachments II - VI.
