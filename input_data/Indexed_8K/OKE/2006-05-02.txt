Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  May 2, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its first-quarter 2006 net income increased to $129.5 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared with $107.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
First-quarter 2006 results include operating income increases in the company's energy services, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage segments, with the gathering and processing and distributions segments down slightly.
"The natural gas liquids assets we acquired last year continue to perform as expected, benefiting both our natural gas liquids and pipelines and storage segments," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"Our energy services segment turned in an outstanding performance as we continued to provide value to our customers through the delivery of physical products and risk management services through our portfolio of contracted transportation and storage capacity. Improved natural gas basis differentials and storage margins from increased demand fees also positively affected the energy services segment's performance," Kyle stated.
ONEOK adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, requiring the company to consolidate its investment in Northern Border Partners, L.P. in its financial statements, effective Jan. 1, 2006. The adoption did not have an effect on the company's net income; however, reported revenues, costs and expenses are higher, reflecting the activities of the partnership. First-quarter 2006 results reflect the consolidation, which resulted in increased operating income of $63.8 million.
ONEOK's first-quarter results also include income from the three segments  gathering and processing, natural gas liquids and pipelines and storage  that were sold to Northern Border Partners, effective April 1, 2006. Beginning with the second quarter 2006, results from those segments will be included in the partnership's stand-alone financial results but will still be included in ONEOK's consolidated results.
"With our completion of the transactions with Northern Border Partners and TransCanada in early April, we have established a strong foundation for future growth," Kyle

added. "As the general partner and a 45.7 percent owner of the partnership, our interests are clearly aligned with the partnership as it pursues opportunities to grow, benefiting not only the partnership's unit holders but also ONEOK's shareholders."

FIRST-QUARTER 2006 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
For comparison purposes, the segment financial and operating results for 2005 have been reclassified to reflect the transfer of the company's legacy natural gas liquids marketing business, which was previously in the gathering and processing segment, to the natural gas liquids segment.
Gathering and Processing
The gathering and processing segment's operating income for the first quarter 2006 was $32.5 million, compared with $33.0 million in the same quarter 2005. Higher commodity prices offset an operating income reduction of $9.4 million attributed to the sale of the Texas assets.
Net margin for the first quarter was $62.4 million, compared with $71.1 million in the same period 2005. Net margin decreased $18.8 million due to the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets in December 2005. Margins were $3.4 million higher, related to the company's realized gross processing margins, net of hedging, on its keep-whole contracts. Higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices on percent-of-proceeds contracts contributed an additional $9.9 million in net margin, net of hedging, compared with the same period last year. A

decrease of $3.2 million was due to reduced volumes processed because of natural production declines and contract expirations. In the quarter, the volume of gas gathered, processed and sold also declined as a result of the sale of the Texas assets.
As a result of the Texas asset sale, operating costs declined $7.2 million, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $2.2 million and capital expenditures declined $1.4 million. These operating cost decreases were partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.

Natural Gas Liquids
The natural gas liquids segment had operating income of $17.1 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $4.8 million in the same period 2005.
Net margin increased to $33.7 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $7.3 million in 2005. The acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets in July 2005 contributed $28.2 million in additional net margin. These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million margin decrease in the company's legacy NGL marketing business, primarily caused by lower sales volumes as a result of the Texas gathering and processing asset sale.
Natural gas liquids supplies connected to the company's assets continue to grow as expected, despite periods of ethane rejection. During the quarter, the natural gas liquids segment completed construction to connect two new natural gas processing plants to its system in the mid-continent area, which came on line in April 2006. Construction is also scheduled to begin mid-year to connect two additional mid-continent gas processing plants.
Operating costs in the first quarter 2006 increased to $11.2 million versus $2.4 million in the first quarter 2005, with $8.9 million of the increase associated with the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets in July 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $5.4 million year over year, with $5.3 million of the increase related to the asset acquisition.
Pipelines and Storage
The pipelines and storage segment reported operating income of $27.7 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $14.2 million in the same period 2005. Net margin in the period increased to $52.1 million, compared with $30.1 million in the same quarter last year.
The margin increase was primarily the result of the natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired in July 2005, which contributed $14.1 million in additional net margin. Natural gas transportation net margins increased $6.1 million due to increased throughput, improved fuel position and higher commodity prices. Storage margins increased $1.3 million as a result of new and renegotiated contracts.
Operating costs increased $5.2 million to $16.8 million in the first quarter 2006, with $4.6 million of the increase resulting from the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets and the balance associated with higher regulatory compliance and employee-related costs. Depreciation,

depletion and amortization expense increased $3.2 million in the quarter, primarily related to operating the newly acquired NGL pipelines.
Energy Services
The energy services segment posted operating income of $93.3 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $52.7 million in the first quarter 2005. Net margin increased to $103.2 million from $61.2 million in the same period last year.
Net margin increases included: $28.2 million in transportation margins, net of hedges, due to improved natural gas basis differentials in the mid-continent and Gulf Coast regions; $9.5 million in storage margins due to increases in demand fees associated with peaking and load-following services, and; a $4.1 million increase from natural gas trading operations, primarily due to favorable natural gas basis spreads.
Natural gas volumes marketed declined 5 percent, and natural gas storage withdrawals declined 28.2 percent as a result of record-setting warmer weather in January 2006.
Financial trading margins were $11.9 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $7.8 million in the first quarter 2005, with the increase related to the previously mentioned favorable natural gas basis spreads.
Operating costs for the first quarter 2006 increased to $9.3 million, compared with $8.0 million in the same period last year, due primarily to higher employee-related costs.
On March 31, 2006, natural gas in storage was 42.3 Bcf, compared with 40.2 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas in storage on April 30, 2006, was 58.7 Bcf. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf on March 31, 2006, compared with 87 Bcf a year earlier.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
 
Distribution
The distribution segment reported first-quarter 2006 operating income of $76.9 million, compared with $80.6 million in the same period last year. Net margin was $195.9 million versus $201.2 million in the same period a year earlier.

Net margins improved $14.9 million as the result of implementation of new rates in Oklahoma in 2005, offset by a $12.2 million decline related to expiring riders in Oklahoma. The segment experienced an additional $6.7 million decline in customer sales due to warmer weather throughout its service territory.
Total volumes delivered declined 7 percent as a result of warmer weather, while operating income declined 5 percent. The impact of warmer than normal weather in the quarter was moderated by approved weather-protection mechanisms in all three states; other rate mechanisms in Texas and the implementation of a new two-tier rate structure in Oklahoma. The new Oklahoma rate structure reduces volumetric sensitivity while providing more consistent earnings and cash flow over time.
Operating costs were $90.8 million in the quarter, compared with $90.6 million in the same quarter 2005, primarily as a result of $2.1 million in higher labor and employee benefit costs, offset by a $1.9 million decrease in bad debt expense.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $28.2 million, compared with $30.0 million in the first quarter 2005. The decrease was primarily related to $2.0 million in cathodic protection and service lines amortization in Oklahoma that expired in 2005.
Northern Border Partners
Partnership operating income increased to $63.8 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $63.5 million in the same period a year earlier. Net margin was $126.8 million in the first quarter 2006 versus $127.9 million. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $21.3 million in the first quarter 2006, compared with $21.4 million in the same period last year. 2005 operating income is not consolidated in ONEOK's financial results.
The operating income increase is the result of higher revenues in the partnership's gathering and processing business, offset by expenses related to the transactions with ONEOK and TC PipeLines Intermediate Limited Partnership.
Effective April 1, 2006, the partnership sold to TC PipeLines Intermediate Limited Partnership, a publicly traded partnership affiliated with TransCanada, a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company for approximately $297 million. The price of the 20 percent interest, along with a related share of Northern Border Pipeline's outstanding debt, totals $418 million. As a result, Northern Border Partners and TC PipeLines, LP, will each own a 50-percent interest in the pipeline, with an affiliate of TransCanada becoming operator of the pipeline in April 2007.
