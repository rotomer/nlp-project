TULSA, Okla. -- July 19, 2006 -- The board of directors of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today increased the quarterly dividend by 7 percent to 32 cents per share of common stock, payable Aug. 14, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business July 31, 2006. With this action, the company's annual dividend increases to $1.28 from $1.20 per share of common stock.
"Our continued strong business performance has increased our cash flow, enabling us to provide our shareholders with improved returns in the form of dividends," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In approving this increase, the board determined that a target payout above 50 percent of sustainable earnings would be appropriate," Kyle added.
In April 2006, the company raised its dividend to 30 cents per share from 28 cents a share. Since January 2003, the company has increased its dividend nine times, representing a 106 percent increase during that period.
