Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Aug. 2, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its second-quarter 2006 net income increased to $77.8 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, compared with $24.9 million, or 23 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year. The company also announced that it is increasing its 2006 earnings guidance to the range of $2.36 to $2.44 per diluted share, compared with previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.36 per diluted share.
Second-quarter 2006 results include increases in the company's energy services and distribution segments and the consolidation of ONEOK Partners, L. P. (NYSE:OKS) results, which also had improved operating performance. Second-quarter ONEOK Partners results included a $113.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006; ONEOK's share of the gain is $52.0 million. ONEOK sold its gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and pipelines and storage assets to ONEOK Partners and became sole general partner in April 2006.
"The completion of the transaction with ONEOK Partners, resulting in our becoming sole general partner and owner of 45.7 percent of the partnership, was a transforming event for our company," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "ONEOK Partners' second-quarter performance improved, resulting in $96.0 million in pre-tax income for ONEOK," Kyle added.
"Our energy services segment turned in exceptional results, continuing to create value for customers through the delivery of physical products and risk management services from its portfolio of contracted transportation and storage capacity," Kyle said. "Improved marketing margins, primarily due to optimization activities, and increased transportation basis spreads benefited the energy services business.
"The company's distribution segment had higher operating income, primarily as a result of increased rates in Oklahoma, partially offset by warmer than average weather in the quarter," Kyle added.

ONEOK adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, requiring the company to consolidate its investment in ONEOK Partners in its financial statements, effective Jan. 1, 2006. The adoption did not have an effect on the company's net income; however, reported revenues, costs and expenses are higher, reflecting the activities of the partnership. Second-quarter and year-to-date 2006 results reflect the consolidation, which resulted in increased operating income to the company. Attachment A provides a consolidating income statement for the second quarter.
"ONEOK Partners' quarterly distributions have increased 19 percent this year and exceed the high end of the indicated distribution target range, and the partnership anticipates increasing future distributions as the partnership grows," Kyle stated. "The partnership has established a solid foundation for future growth  benefiting partnership unit holders and ONEOK shareholders  by announcing more than $1 billion in internally generated growth projects over the next three years."
ONEOK's net income for the six-month period was $207.3 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared with $132.5 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2005. Strong performances in the energy services and distribution segments, combined with the gain from the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline and stronger performance by the assets sold to ONEOK Partners contributed to the increase.

SECOND-QUARTER 2006 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
Energy Services
The energy services segment posted operating income of $53.5 million in the second quarter 2006, compared with $2.9 million in the second quarter 2005. Net margin increased to $64.3 million from $11.2 million in the same period last year.
Net margin increases during the second quarter included: $21.9 million in marketing margins due to optimization activities; $16.8 million in transportation margins, net of hedges, due to improved natural gas basis differentials in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions; and a $1.3 million increase from improved physical margins in the retail business. Financial trading margins were $8.7 million in the second quarter 2006, compared with a loss of $4.7 million in the second quarter 2005, due to improved trading margins in the natural gas options portfolio.
Operating costs for the second quarter 2006 increased to $10.3 million, compared with $7.8 million in the same period last year, due primarily to higher employee-related costs.
Six-month operating income was $146.8 million, compared with $55.6 million in the same period 2005. Net margin increased to $167.5 million from $72.4 million in the same period last year.
Net margin increases during the first half of the year included: $45.0 million in transportation margins, net of hedges, due to improved natural gas basis differentials in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions; a $32.0 million increase in marketing margins due to increases in demand fees associated with peaking and load-following services in the first quarter 2006 and optimization activities in the second quarter 2006, and a $1.5 million increase from improved physical margins in the retail business. Financial trading margins were $20.6 million in the first half 2006, compared with $3.1 million in the same period 2005, due to successful basis trading activities, as well as improved trading margins in the option portfolio.
Operating costs for the first half 2006 increased to $19.6 million, compared with $15.8 million in the same period last year, due primarily to higher employee-related costs.

Natural gas volumes marketed declined in the second quarter and six-month period, primarily due to higher storage injections in the second quarter 2006. In addition, warmer weather in the first quarter throughout most of the segment's service territory resulted in decreased storage withdrawals.
On June 30, 2006, natural gas in storage was 73.3 Bcf, compared with 59.0 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas in storage on July 31, 2006, was 69.9 Bcf. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf on June 30, 2006, unchanged from a year earlier.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
 
Distribution
The distribution segment reported second-quarter 2006 operating income of $0.9 million, compared with a loss of $7.0 million in the same period last year. Net margin was $119.6 million versus $106.5 million in the same period a year earlier.
Second-quarter net margins improved $13.1 million, primarily resulting from a $15.4 million increase from the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma in July 2005, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease related to expiring riders and lower volumetric-dependent rider collections in Oklahoma.
Operating costs were $91.5 million in the quarter, compared with $83.5 million in the same quarter 2005, primarily as a result of a $7.8 million increase in labor and employee benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $27.2 million, compared with $30.0 million in the second quarter 2005. The decrease was primarily related to a limited issue rider that expired in Oklahoma.
The distribution segment reported six month 2006 operating income of $77.7 million, compared with $73.6 million in the same period last year. Net margin was $315.1 million versus $307.7 million in the same period a year earlier.
Six-month net margins improved $7.4 million with the implementation of new rate schedules in Oklahoma in July 2005 adding $30.3 million, offset by a $15.8 million decline

related to expiring riders and lower volumetric-dependent rider collections in Oklahoma and a $9.0 million decline in customer sales due to warmer weather in the segment's entire service territory.
Operating costs were $182.0 million in the first six months, compared with $174.1 million in the same period 2005, primarily as a result of a $9.9 million increase in labor and employee benefit costs, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in bad debt expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $55.3 million, compared with $60.0 million in the six-month period 2005. The decrease was primarily related to a $2.9 million charge in the first quarter 2005 related to the replacement of a customer service system in Texas and the expiration of a limited issue rider in Oklahoma.
Residential and commercial natural gas volumes decreased in the second quarter and six-month period due to warmer weather, primarily in the first quarter 2006.
ONEOK Partners
Partnership operating income increased to $212.6 million in the second quarter 2006, compared with $56.4 million in the same period a year earlier, and included a $113.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006.
Net margin was $215.2 million in the second quarter 2006 versus $114.3 million in the same period 2005. Net margin increases included $44.1 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners' assets that ONEOK was required to consolidate on Jan. 1, 2006; $59.4 million related to the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets acquired by ONEOK, Inc. in July 2005; $8.5 million increase resulting from the partnership's consolidation of the Guardian Pipeline, beginning Jan. 1, 2006; and $12.2 million from higher commodity prices, wider gross processing spreads and increased transportation revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $20.9 million decrease resulting from the December 2005 sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $39.3 million in the second quarter 2006, compared with $13.0 million in the same period last year. Second-quarter depreciation, depletion and amortization expense included a non-cash impairment charge of $11.8 million related to the partnership's Black Mesa coal slurry pipeline operation.
Operating expenses for the second quarter 2006 were $77.2 million versus $44.9 million in the same period last year. The operating cost increase is primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, the natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005 and the consolidation of Guardian Pipeline, offset by the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets.

For the six months, operating income increased to $312.5 million, compared with $108.4 million in the same period a year earlier, and included the gain on the sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Net margin was $420.1 million in the first half 2006 versus $222.8 million in the same period a year earlier. Net margin increases included $91.5 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners' assets that were consolidated on Jan. 1, 2006; $101.8 million related to the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets acquired by ONEOK in July 2005; $17.8 million increase resulting from the consolidation of Guardian Pipeline, beginning Jan. 1, 2006; and 28.4 million from higher commodity prices, significantly wider gross processing spreads and increased transportation revenues. These increases were partially offset by a $39.7 million decrease resulting from the December 2005 sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $66.8 million in the first half 2006 and includes the $11.8 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Black Mesa coal slurry pipeline, compared with $25.7 million in the same period last year. Operating expenses in the first six months of 2006 were $155.8 million, compared with $88.7 million last year, primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, the natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005 and the consolidation of Guardian Pipeline, offset by the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets.
2005 operating results for the assets sold to ONEOK Partners are included in ONEOK's consolidated financial results; however, ONEOK Partners' legacy assets are not included in ONEOK's 2005 results.
UPDATED 2006 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
As reflected in Attachment B, ONEOK is updating its 2006 earnings guidance, which was originally disclosed on March 8, 2006, to reflect projected changes in the company's energy services and ONEOK Partners segments.
For 2006, the company expects net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.36 to $2.44 per diluted share. Previous guidance was $2.30 to $2.36 per diluted share.
Energy services operating income estimates have been updated to $195 million from $183 million to reflect financial trading margins realized in the first half of 2006, partially offset by lower than expected natural gas storage withdrawals in the second half of 2006. Second-half 2006 guidance does not include any additional margin from financial trading activities.
Distribution operating income is now estimated at $122 million, compared with previous guidance of $124 million. The slight reduction is related to warmer weather in the first half of 2006.

Operating income from ONEOK Partners has been increased to $363 million from $340 million. The increase is the result of the partnership purchasing the remaining interest in Guardian Pipeline and higher first-half 2006 gross processing spreads in the partnership's gathering and processing segment.
Estimated consolidated capital expenditures have increased to $472 million from $319 million. ONEOK Partners' capital expenditures increased to $321 million to reflect the planned expenditures related to Overland Pass Pipeline and related infrastructure projects and the increased ownership in Guardian Pipeline. Distribution segment capital expenditures are unchanged at $148 million.
On a consolidated basis, expected cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, is being revised to $701 million, a reduction of $98 million, to reflect current income taxes on the partnership's distributions received by ONEOK, which are expected to be higher in 2006 than originally estimated. As a result, capital expenditures, dividends and distributions to minority interests are expected to exceed cash flow by $73 million.
On a stand-alone basis, ONEOK's cash flow, before changes in working capital, is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by $108 million to reflect the higher taxes and the timing of the partnership's fourth-quarter distribution of about $43 million, which will not be received until February 2007.
