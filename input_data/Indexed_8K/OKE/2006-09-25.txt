Exhibit 99.1
TULSA, Okla.  Sept. 21, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) and ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS) announced today that they are increasing their 2006 earnings guidance and providing earnings guidance for the 2006 third and fourth quarters.
ONEOK, Inc. is increasing its 2006 earnings guidance to the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per diluted share, compared with previous guidance of $2.36 to $2.44 per diluted share. ONEOK, Inc. third-quarter earnings guidance is estimated in a range between $0.15 and $0.19 per diluted share, with fourth-quarter earnings guidance projected in a range of between $0.55 and $0.59 per diluted share. The average number of outstanding shares is now estimated at 113.9 million shares, as a result of the accelerated stock repurchase program completed and announced in August. Previous earnings guidance included an average of 117 million outstanding shares.
ONEOK Partners is increasing its 2006 earnings guidance to the range of $4.77 to $4.90 per unit, compared with previous guidance of $4.43 to $4.69 per unit. ONEOK Partners' third-quarter earnings guidance is estimated in a range between $0.89 and $0.99 per unit, with fourth-quarter earnings guidance projected in a range between $0.72 and $0.82 per unit. As a result, distributable cash flow for 2006 is expected to be in the range of $353 million to $363 million, or $4.32 to $4.46 per unit.
"ONEOK Partners will benefit from stronger than expected performance in its gathering and processing, and pipelines and storage segments," said David Kyle, chairman, president and CEO of ONEOK, Inc. and chairman and CEO of ONEOK Partners.
Continued strong NGL prices and processing spreads in the gathering and processing segment and higher throughput and realized rates in the pipelines and storage segment are expected to benefit ONEOK Partners' second half 2006 performance.
"ONEOK will benefit from the higher anticipated results from the partnership, as well as stronger results in ONEOK's energy services segment," Kyle added. "As a result, we are increasing our earnings guidance for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners."
