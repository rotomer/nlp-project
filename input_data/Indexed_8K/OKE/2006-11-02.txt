Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 1, 2006  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its third-quarter 2006 net income was $24.4 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, compared with $176.4 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net income for the nine months was $231.7 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, compared with $308.9 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
Third-quarter and year-to-date 2005 results included a net after-tax gain of $151.4 million, or $1.39 per diluted share in the third quarter and $1.38 in the nine-month period, from the sale of the company's oil and gas production business, partially offset by a $32.9 million, or 30 cents per diluted share, loss from discontinued operations related to the recently completed sale of the company's Spring Creek power plant in Oklahoma.
"Performance in our ONEOK Partners and distribution segments improved in the quarter," said David Kyle, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Strong commodity prices and higher gross processing spreads contributed to ONEOK Partners' performance, while implementation of new rates in Oklahoma last July improved results in our distribution segment."
"Lower storage and marketing margins in the company's energy services segment were responsible for lower third-quarter results; however, the segment's nine-month performance has been exceptional," Kyle added.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was $119.5 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 9 percent, compared with the same period in 2005. For the first nine months of 2006, operating income was $659.0 million, an increase of $310.4 million, or 89 percent, from the same period last year.
ONEOK adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, requiring the company to consolidate its investment in ONEOK Partners in its financial statements, effective Jan. 1, 2006. The adoption did not have an effect on the company's net income; however, reported revenues, costs and expenses are higher, reflecting the activities of the partnership. Third-quarter and year-to-date 2006 results reflect the

consolidation, which resulted in increased operating income to the company. Attachment A provides a consolidating income statement for the third-quarter and year-to-date 2006 results.

ONEOK Partners
Operating income for the third quarter 2006 was $107.6 million, compared with $80.8 million in the same period 2005. Net margin was $210.7 million, compared with $168.7 million in the same period 2005.
The net margin increase in the third quarter 2006 included: a $49.5 million increase from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations that were consolidated beginning Jan. 1, 2006; an increase of $19.7 million from higher natural gas liquids prices, wider gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues; and a decrease of $25.2 million, resulting from the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005.
Third-quarter 2006 operating costs were $75.5 million, compared with $66.8 million in the third quarter 2005, with the increases related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Third-quarter 2006 depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $27.5 million versus $21.2 million in the same period last year. The increase of $6.3 million is primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, offset by the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005.
Equity earnings from investments were $22.8 million in the third quarter 2006 and result from ONEOK Partners' 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline and its gathering and processing joint venture interests in the Powder River and Wind River Basins. Other income increased in the three-month 2006 period primarily as a result of interest income from cash and other investments.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2006 was $420.1 million, compared with $189.2 million in the same period 2005. Operating income includes a $113.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006. Net margin was $624.1 million, compared with $391.5 million in the same period 2005.
Net margin increases in the nine-month 2006 period included: a $152.6 million increase from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations that were consolidated beginning Jan. 1, 2006; an increase of $101.8 million for the natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005; an increase of $48.1 million from higher natural gas liquids prices, wider gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues; and a decrease of $64.9 million, resulting from the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005.
Operating costs for the first nine months of 2006 were $224.7 million, compared with $155.5 million in the third quarter 2005, with the increases related to the consolidation of the

legacy ONEOK Partners operations and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the first nine months of 2006 was $94.3 million versus $46.9 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets acquired in July 2005 and the Black Mesa Pipeline impairment in the second quarter 2006, offset by the sale of natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Texas in December 2005.
Equity earnings from investments were $72.8 million for the first nine months of 2006 and resulted from ONEOK Partners' 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline and its gathering and processing joint venture interests in the Powder River and Wind River Basins. Other income increased in the nine-month 2006 period primarily as a result of interest income from cash and other investments.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported an operating loss of $9.2 million in the third quarter 2006, compared with an operating loss of $12.8 million in the third quarter 2005. Net margin for the third quarter 2006 was $106.9 million, compared with net margin of $105.1 million in the same period a year earlier.
The third-quarter net margin increase resulted from an increase of $5.6 million, primarily due to the implementation of new rates in Oklahoma, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease from expiring riders and lower volumetric rider collections in Oklahoma, and a $1.5 million reduction in transport margins in Oklahoma.
Operating costs were $88.8 million, compared with $91.6 million in the third quarter 2005. The reduction is related to lower labor and employee benefit costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $27.3 million, compared with $26.3 million in the third quarter last year.
Operating income for the nine-month period in 2006 was $68.5 million, compared with $60.8 million in the same period last year. Net margin increased to $422.0 million versus $412.8 million last year. The increase was primarily due to a $39.4 million increase related to implementation of new rates in Oklahoma; a decrease of $18.0 million primarily due to expiring riders and lower volumetric rider collections in Oklahoma; and a decrease of $12.9 million in customer sales due to warmer weather in the segment's entire service territory.
The impact of warmer-than-normal weather during the nine-month period was moderated by approved weather-protection mechanisms and by the implementation of a new two-tier rate structure in Oklahoma. The new Oklahoma rate structure reduces volumetric sensitivity and provides more consistent earnings and cash flow.

Operating costs for the nine months were $270.9 million, compared with $265.7 million in the same period last year due to an increase of $7.8 million in labor and employee benefit costs, which were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in bad debt expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $82.6 million, compared with $86.3 million in the same period last year. The decrease was related primarily to a $2.9 million charge in the first quarter 2005 related to the replacement of a field customer service system in Texas.
Residential and commercial volumes decreased for the nine-month period due to warmer weather, primarily in the first quarter of 2006. Decreases in wholesale volumes were due to a reduction in volumes available for sale.
Energy Services
The energy services segment had operating income in the third quarter of $21.6 million, compared with operating income of $42.1 million in the same period in 2005. The decrease was related to lower natural gas sales from storage and lower marketing margins in the third quarter 2006, compared with the same period in 2005.
Net margin was $30.7 million, compared with $55.0 million in the three-month period 2005. In the third quarter 2006, there were $6.6 million in mark-to-market gains on unqualified hedges of transportation and storage contracts. In the same period of 2005, there were $12.6 million in losses for these same activities.
The third quarter also included: a $34.5 million decline in storage and marketing margins as a result of reduced storage and marketing optimization opportunities in 2006, compared with 2005 when hurricanes had a significant impact on natural gas volatility and affected natural gas prices; and a decrease of $10.2 million in financial trading margins primarily due to positions in the natural gas options portfolio that benefited from increased natural gas prices and higher volatility in 2005, compared with 2006.
Operating costs for the quarter were $8.6 million, compared with $12.5 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily due to lower litigation costs, employee-related expenses and bad debt expenses.
Nine-month operating income was $168.4 million, compared with $97.7 million in the same period in 2005. Net margin increased to $198.2 million, compared with $127.5 million in the nine-month period 2005.
In the nine-month period of 2006, there were $4.9 million in mark-to-market gains on unqualified hedges of transportation and storage contracts. In the nine-month period of 2005, there were $11.7 million in losses for these same activities.

The nine-month period also included: an increase of $41.3 million in physical transportation margins, net of hedging activities, primarily due to improved natural gas basis differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions; an increase of $7.2 million in financial trading margins primarily associated with favorable basis spread movements in the basis trading portfolio; and an increase of $4.8 million primarily related to storage and marketing margins due to storage optimization activities in the second quarter of 2006.
Operating costs for the nine months were $28.2 million, compared with $28.3 million due to decreased litigation expenses, offset primarily by increased employee-related costs.
Natural gas volumes marketed decreased for the three- and nine-month periods in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due to higher storage injections in the second and third quarters of 2006, and warmer weather in the majority of the segment's service territory in the first quarter, resulting in decreased sales from storage.
Natural gas in storage at Sept. 30, 2006, was 80.2 Bcf, compared with 60.4 Bcf at Sept. 30, 2005. Natural gas in storage on Oct. 31, 2006, was 80.4 Bcf. At Sept. 30, 2006, total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf, unchanged from the same period a year earlier.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
