Our updated 2006 earnings guidance is in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. This includes a $52 million, or 28 cents per share, one-time gain on our portion of ONEOK Partners, L.P.'s sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.

ONEOK's updated 2006 earnings guidance is in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share and includes a $52 million, or 28 cents per share, one-time gain on ONEOK's share of ONEOK Partners' sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline. ONEOK's preliminary 2007 earnings guidance is estimated to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.75 per diluted share.

ONEOK Partners' preliminary 2007 earnings guidance is $3.06 to $3.46 per unit. Preliminary estimates for ONEOK Partners' 2007 distributable cash flow are $370 million to $404 million, or $3.91 to $4.32 per unit. The average number of units outstanding for 2007 is expected to be 82.9 million, compared with 73.8 million in 2006.
Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners preliminary 2007 guidance is based on estimates using current New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for natural gas and crude oil and current Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) prices for natural gas liquids. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to update their 2007 guidance during the year.

"ONEOK Partners' 2007 guidance reflects higher interest expense, reduced margins from gathering and

processing, and lower equity earnings from our investment in Northern Border Pipeline," he added.
2006 UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR ONEOK, INC.
The updated segment income statement, capital expenditure forecasts and cash flow projections for 2006 are included in Attachment I. Following are the significant changes in operating income.
The operating income for ONEOK Partners is forecasted at $508 million versus a previous forecast of $498 million. For energy services, operating income is projected at $220 million versus $205 million from the previous forecast, due to greater than expected natural gas sales and optimization opportunities in the fourth quarter.
2006 UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR ONEOK PARTNERS, L.P.
The most significant change in operating income is in the gathering and processing segment where operating income is projected to be $183 million, compared with the previous estimate of $176 million. This improvement is primarily due to strong commodity prices and wider than expected gross processing spreads.
The updated segment income statement and distributable cash flow projections for 2006 are included in Attachment II.
2007 PRELIMINARY GUIDANCE FOR ONEOK, INC.
ONEOK's operating income from its ONEOK Partners segment for 2007 is forecasted at $387 million. For 2006, revised operating income guidance of $508 million includes a $114 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Operating income for the distribution segment for 2007 is projected at $161 million, compared with revised 2006 guidance of $120 million. The increase is due to the recently settled rate increase in Kansas, partially offset by lower margins and higher employee and operating costs in Oklahoma.
In the energy services segment, operating income for 2007 is projected at $205 million, compared with revised guidance of $220 million in 2006. The decrease is primarily due to lower estimated commodity prices and related spreads.
The ONEOK segment income statement projections for 2007 are included in Attachment III.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
ONEOK Partners has disclosed in this news release forecasted EBITDA and DCF amounts that are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes EBITDA and DCF provide useful information to investors as a measure of comparison with peer companies. However, these calculations may vary from company to company, so the partnership's computations may not be comparable with those of other companies. DCF is not necessarily the same as available cash as defined in the Partnership Agreements. Management further uses EBITDA to compare the financial performance of its segments and to internally manage those business segments. Reconciliations of forecasted EBITDA to forecasted net income, and forecasted computations of DCF for 2006 and 2007, are included in Attachments II and IV to this release.
