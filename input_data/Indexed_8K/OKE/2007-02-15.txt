Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
We own a 45.7 percent interest in ONEOK Partners, L.P. which owns a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company. We reflect our interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company as an investment in unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On February 14, 2007, Northern Border Pipeline Company disclosed in a Current Report on form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission certain unaudited operating and financial information for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Our share of Northern Border Pipeline Company's operating results is reported as equity earnings from investments in our Consolidated Statements of Income and is $16.7 million and $72.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, respectively. For those same periods, we received partner distributions of $24.4 million and $98.4 million, respectively.
The summarized unaudited operating and financial information disclosed by Northern Border Pipeline Company as of, and for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows:
 
 
Northern Border Pipeline Company's net income for the three months ended December 31, 2006, was $3.2 million lower when compared with the same period in 2005. This reduction in net income was primarily due to increased operations and maintenance expenses. Net income for the year was $22.4 million lower when compared to 2005. The reduction in net income was primarily due to decreased net operating revenues and increased operations and maintenance expenses. The decrease in net operating revenues for 2006 was mainly due to a one-time increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2005 of $9.4 million resulting from the sale of bankruptcy claims against Enron Corp. and Enron North America Corp. The increased operations and maintenance expenses, as compared with last year, were due to increased general and administrative expenses.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
