Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 26, 2007  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today that its net income for the year was $306.3 million, or $2.68 per diluted share of common stock, compared with $546.5 million, or $5.06 per diluted share of common stock, a year earlier. 2006 results include a $113.9 million pre-tax gain related to ONEOK Partners' sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline; ONEOK's after-tax share of the gain was $32.3 million, or 28 cents per diluted share.
Year-end 2005 net income included an after-tax gain on the sale of a discontinued component of $149.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share of common stock, from the sale of the company's oil and gas production business, and an after-tax gain of $161.8 million, or $1.50 per diluted share of common stock, on the sale of the company's Texas gathering and processing assets, recorded in income from continuing operations. These 2005 gains were partially offset by a $32.4 million, or 30 cents per diluted share, impairment related to the company's sale of its Spring Creek power plant in Oklahoma.
The following table adjusts 2006 and 2005 reported net income to eliminate the effects of these gains and losses:
 
In the fourth quarter 2006, ONEOK reported net income of $74.6 million, or 66 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $75.8 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2005, excluding the $161.8 million, or $1.57 per diluted share of common stock,

after-tax gain on the sale of the Texas gathering and processing assets, recorded in income from continuing operations.
"Our ONEOK Partners and energy services segments turned in exceptional performances," said John W. Gibson, chief executive officer of ONEOK. "Our distribution segment also reported solid results, benefiting from the first full year of new rates in Oklahoma.
"The transaction with ONEOK Partners that was completed in April 2006 is delivering strong operating results and providing an excellent platform for additional growth at ONEOK," Gibson stated.
Net margin increased in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of the Jan. 1, 2006, consolidation of the company's investment in ONEOK Partners as required by the applicable accounting rules; the effect of the natural gas liquids assets acquired from Koch in July 2005; strong commodity prices, wider gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenue in the ONEOK Partners segment; and higher transportation margins in the energy services segment.
In 2006, operating income increased to $745.7 million from $534.8 million in 2005, excluding the gains on the sales of assets of $115.9 million in 2006 and $264.2 million in 2005.
Operating costs for 2006 increased primarily because of the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily as a result of the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations at the beginning of 2006, the acquisition of the natural gas liquids assets in July 2005 and the ONEOK Partners impairment charges for Black Mesa Pipeline of $12.0 million in the second quarter 2006.
Equity earnings from investments increased $93.3 million in 2006, compared with 2005. Equity earnings from Northern Border Pipeline contributed $72.4 million, and ONEOK Partners' gathering and processing joint ventures contributed $22.6 million in 2006.

Net margin increased to $841.2 million for 2006, compared with $546.8 million in 2005, as a result of: an increase of $191.1 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, which was consolidated beginning Jan. 1, 2006; an increase of $101.8 million related to the natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines acquired from Koch in July 2005; an increase of $72.1 million from the legacy ONEOK operations, driven primarily by strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues; and a decrease of $80.5 million resulting from the sale of Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Operating costs increased $103.2 million in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations at Jan. 1, 2006, and the natural gas liquids assets acquired in 2005, offset by the impact resulting from the sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by $54.6 million for 2006 compared with 2005, primarily due to $37.9 million related to the consolidation of the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, $12.0 million for the Black Mesa Pipeline impairments and $15.5 million for the acquisition of natural gas liquids assets from Koch in 2005. These increases were offset by an $8.2 million decrease resulting from the December 2005 sale of the Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets.
Equity earnings from investments increased by $103.5 million in 2006, primarily from ONEOK Partners' interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Fourth-quarter operating income was $90.5 million versus $70.0 million in the same quarter 2005, excluding the 2005 pre-tax gain of $264.2 million on the sale of the company's Texas gathering and processing assets. Net margin for the period was $217.0 million, compared with $155.3 million in 2005, as a result of an increase of $48.4 million from the legacy ONEOK Partners operations, which were consolidated beginning Jan. 1, 2006; an increase of $24.0 million, driven primarily by strong commodity prices, higher gross processing spreads and increased natural gas transportation revenues from the legacy ONEOK operations; and a decrease of $15.6 million resulting from the sale of Texas natural gas gathering and processing assets in December 2005.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported 2006 operating income of $117.5 million, compared with $113.9 million last year. Net margin was $599.8 million in 2006 versus $587.7 million in 2005, an increase of $12.1 million.
Net margin improvements were the result of implementation of new rates in Oklahoma, which contributed $39.7 million, and in Texas, which contributed $2.6 million. These increases were offset by a decrease of $19 million, primarily due to expired riders that are a component of the new rates in Oklahoma; a decrease of $10 million in customer sales due to warmer weather in

the company's service territory; and a decrease of $1.8 million due to reduced wholesale volumes in Kansas.
Operating costs increased $11.1 million year over year because of $17.2 million in higher labor and employee benefit costs and $1.7 million of higher property taxes, partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in bad debt expense.
Residential and commercial volumes decreased for the year due to warmer weather, primarily in the first quarter of 2006. Customer conservation also contributed to lower volumes. Wholesale volumes decreased in 2006, compared with 2005, due to reduced volumes available for sale.
The temperatures for the 2006 winter heating season were among the warmest on record in the past 100 years  second warmest year in Texas and Oklahoma, and fourth warmest in Kansas. The impact of warmer-than-normal weather for the year was moderated by approved weather-protection mechanisms and by the implementation of a new two-tier rate structure in Oklahoma. The new rate structure in Oklahoma reduces volumetric sensitivity while providing more consistent earnings and cash flow over time.
Fourth-quarter operating income was $48.9 million versus $53.1 million in the same quarter 2005, primarily due to increased operating costs. Net margin was $177.8 million, compared with $174.9 million in the fourth quarter 2005. Operating costs increased $6.0 million in the fourth quarter 2006 versus 2005 primarily because of higher employee-related costs and property taxes, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.
Energy Services
The energy services segment posted operating income of $229.2 million, compared with $165.6 million in 2005. Net margin increased to $273.8 million from $206.4 million in 2005.
Net margin increases included $58 million in transportation margins primarily due to improved natural gas basis differentials between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions, and $7.1 million from financial trading.
Operating costs for the year increased to $42.5 million, compared with $38.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of higher employee-related costs.
On Dec. 31, 2006, natural gas in storage was 74.1 Bcf, compared with 62.1 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 86 Bcf on Dec. 31, 2006, and 2005. On Jan. 31, 2007, natural gas in storage was 53.0 Bcf.
Fourth-quarter operating income was $60.9 million versus $68.0 million in the same quarter 2005. Net margin was $75.6 million, compared with $78.9 million in the 2005 fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter 2006 net margin decreased $9.4 million related to transportation margins associated with strong 2005 Mid-Continent to Gulf Coast spreads, partially offset by an increase

of $6.1 million due to improved storage and marketing margins. Trading and retail margins in the fourth quarter 2005 were relatively unchanged, compared with the fourth quarter 2005.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
