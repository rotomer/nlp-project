Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  Aug. 1, 2007  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today second-quarter 2007 net income of $35.2 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, compared with $77.8 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2007, was $188.1 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared with $207.3 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Both the second quarter and year-to-date 2006 results include ONEOK's share of its ONEOK Partners' gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company, which had an after-tax impact of $32.3 million, or 27 cents per share, in the second quarter 2006 and 28 cents per share in the six-month 2006 period.
The company also reaffirmed its previous 2007 earnings guidance, but narrowed the range to $2.50 to $2.70 per diluted share, reflecting anticipated stronger performance in the ONEOK Partners and distribution segments, and the recently completed share repurchase. Additional information is available on Exhibit A. The average number of shares outstanding for 2007 is estimated to be approximately 109 million. ONEOK's previous 2007 earnings guidance was estimated to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.75 per diluted share.
"We continue to benefit from our ownership in ONEOK Partners," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer. "The partnership's assets are performing well, and we continue to see increased NGL volumes and favorable market conditions in the natural gas liquids businesses.
"Our distribution segment also turned in a strong performance in the quarter as a result of the implementation of new rates in Kansas and Texas at the first of the year," Gibson added. "Our energy services segment reported lower results in the quarter, reflecting reduced natural gas price volatility."
Operating income for the second quarter 2007 decreased to $135.7 million, compared with $154.5 million for the second quarter 2006, which excludes the gains on the sale of assets in

2006. The decrease is primarily due to the energy services segment's lower storage and marketing margins caused by reduced natural gas price volatility. This decrease was partially offset by the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in ONEOK's distribution segment.
Year-to-date 2007 operating income increased to $464.0 million, compared with $423.6 million for the same period last year, excluding the 2006 gains on the sale of assets. The increase was primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in the distribution segment and increased volumes and product price spreads in ONEOK Partners' natural gas liquids businesses. These increases were partially offset by ONEOK's energy services segment, which experienced lower transportation and financial trading margins, partially offset by higher seasonal spreads in the storage business.
Equity earnings from investments increased slightly to $18.8 million in the second quarter 2007, compared with $18.3 million in the same period in 2006. For the six-month period, equity earnings from investments decreased $7.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in ONEOK Partners' share of Northern Border Pipeline's earnings, as a result of its sale of a 20 percent interest in the pipeline in the second quarter of 2006.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007, primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $11.8 million recorded in the second quarter of 2006, related to Black Mesa Pipeline, Inc.
Results for 2006 are reported as if the April 2006 transaction in which ONEOK Partners purchased assets from ONEOK had occurred on Jan. 1, 2006.

SECOND-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 2007 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
Operating income for the second quarter 2007 was $107.6 million, compared with $212.8 million in the same period 2006, which included the $113.9 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Second-quarter 2007 results reflect increased margins in the natural gas liquids segment as a result of higher product price spreads between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Conway, Kan., higher isomerization price spreads and increased NGL volumes gathered and fractionated resulting from new supply connections. These results were partially offset by lower processed volumes in the gathering and processing segment due to anticipated contract terminations, and lower demand revenues in the interstate natural gas pipelines segment. Second-quarter 2007 operating costs were $80.4 million, compared with $73.8 million in the second quarter 2006, primarily due to increased employee-related costs.
Equity earnings from investments were $18.8 million in the second quarter 2007, compared with $18.3 million in the second quarter 2006.
For the six months, operating income was $211.9 million, compared with $313.0 million in the same period a year earlier, which included the $113.9 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.

Six-month 2007 results reflect increased margins in the natural gas liquids businesses as a result of higher product price spreads between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Conway, Kan., higher isomerization price spreads and increased NGL volumes resulting from new supply connections. These results were partially offset by lower processed volumes in the gathering and processing segment due to anticipated contract terminations. Six-month 2007 operating costs were $155.9 million, compared with $149.1 million in the same period a year earlier, due to higher employee-related costs.
Equity earnings from investments for the six months 2007 were $42.8 million, compared with $50.0 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $11.8 million in the second quarter 2007, compared with operating income of $0.9 million in the second quarter 2006.
The second-quarter 2007 operating income increase is the result of implementation of new rate schedules, which included $9.8 million in Kansas and $1.1 million in Texas. Operating costs were $91.6 million, relatively unchanged from the second quarter 2006.
Operating income for the first half of 2007 was $115.0 million, compared with $77.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is the result of new rate schedules, which included $28.8 million in Kansas and $3.3 million in Texas, and an increase of $10.7 million from higher customer sales volumes as a result of a return to more normal weather patterns in the distribution segment's entire service territory. Operating costs increased $5.3 million for the first half of 2007, compared with the same period in 2006, as a result of higher employee-related costs, bad debt expense and property taxes.
Residential and commercial volumes increased for the three- and six-month periods of 2007 due to more normal weather patterns when compared with the unseasonably warm winter weather in 2006.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported second-quarter 2007 operating income of $10.2 million, compared with operating income of $53.5 million in the same period in 2006. The decline was due primarily to a decrease of $44.0 million in marketing and storage margins, resulting from lower natural gas price volatility, and higher storage fees on renewals and new capacity, partially offset by an increase of $6.5 million in transportation margins associated with higher realized regional spreads. Financial trading margins decreased $6.6 million. Operating costs for the quarter were $8.4 million, compared with $10.3 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.

Six-month operating income was $130.3 million, compared with $146.7 million for the same period last year, primarily due to changes in the natural gas market as lower natural gas price volatility reduced financial trading opportunities. Six-month operating costs were $19.1 million, relatively unchanged from the same period a year earlier.
Natural gas in storage at June 30, 2007, was 64.4 Bcf, compared with 73.3 Bcf at June 30, 2006. At July 31, 2007, total natural gas in storage was approximately 72.3 Bcf. Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 96 Bcf in the second quarter 2007, compared with 86 Bcf in the same period 2006. Storage and transportation costs were higher in the 2007 second-quarter and six-month period, compared with 2006, primarily because of increased storage fees and more capacity under lease.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
