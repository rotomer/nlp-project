EL PASO, Texas - August 31, 2007 -- Texas Gas Service Company has filed for a rate adjustment with the city of El Paso and the municipalities of Anthony, Clint, Horizon City, Socorro and Vinton.
"This rate adjustment will allow us to recover the costs associated with our ongoing capital investment program in the El Paso service area, as well as recover operating and maintenance costs," said Richard Fleager, vice president western region.
Also included in the filing are definitive changes to the cost of purchased gas, transportation tariffs and rules of service. Texas Gas Service is also proposing a conservation program for the El Paso service area.
Texas Gas Service is requesting a total increase of $5,450,250, which would increase the average monthly residential bill by $1.49. The last rate case filed was in 2002. Since then, Texas Gas Service has made interim adjustments for its capital investments under a state statute known as the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). This filing will update all the capital investments filed under GRIP.
Texas Gas Service anticipates that all issues included in this filing will be resolved by January 2008.
