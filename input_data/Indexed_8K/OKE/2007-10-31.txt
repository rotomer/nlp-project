Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  Oct. 31, 2007  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) announced today third-quarter 2007 net income of $13.9 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, compared with $24.4 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Net income for the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2007, was $202 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, compared with $231.7 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, in the same period last year. The year-to-date 2006 results include ONEOK's share of ONEOK Partners' gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company, which had an after-tax impact of $32.3 million, or 28 cents per share.
The company also increased its previous 2007 earnings guidance to a range of $2.62 to $2.72 per diluted share, reflecting anticipated stronger performance in the ONEOK Partners and distribution segments. Additional information is available in Exhibit A. ONEOK's previous 2007 earnings guidance was estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 per diluted share.
"Our ONEOK Partners segment continues to perform well, benefiting ONEOK in the third quarter and in the nine-month period," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer. "Our distribution segment continues to see the positive effects from new rates in Kansas and Texas, however, our energy services segment earnings were lower, reflecting reduced natural gas price volatility," he added.
Operating income for the third quarter 2007 was $102.8 million, compared with $119.6 million for the third quarter 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the energy services segment's lower transportation and storage margins, partially offset by increased financial trading margins.
Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of assets, year-to-date 2007 operating income increased to $564.9 million, compared with $543.1 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas in the distribution segment, partially offset by ONEOK's energy services segment, which experienced lower transportation margins.

THIRD-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 2007 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
Operating income for the third quarter 2007 was $105.1 million, compared with $107.7 million in the same period 2006.
Third-quarter 2007 results reflect increased margins in both of the partnership's natural gas liquids segments from new supply connections in the Mid-Continent, which increased volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold. These results were offset by lower natural gas volumes processed as a result of contract terminations in late 2006 in the partnership's natural gas gathering and processing segment.
Third-quarter 2007 operating costs were $80.1 million, compared with $76.3 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily due to increased employee-related costs and the acquisition of the Mont Belvieu storage business in the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the nine months, operating income was $317.1 million, compared with $420.6 million in the same period a year earlier. The 2006 year-to-date results included the $113.9 million one-time gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Nine-month 2007 results reflect increased margins in the natural gas liquids businesses as a result of higher volumes from new supply connections and higher product price spreads. These increases were partially offset in the natural gas gathering and processing business by lower natural gas volumes processed due primarily to contract terminations in late 2006.
Nine-month 2007 operating costs were $237.4 million, compared with $227.1 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and the acquisition of the Mont Belvieu storage business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Depreciation and amortization decreased $10.0 million, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $11.8 million related to Black Mesa Pipeline, Inc. recorded in the second quarter of 2006.
Equity earnings from investments for the nine months 2007 were $65.0 million, compared with $72.8 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline in the second quarter 2006.
Distribution
Third-quarter results in the distribution segment improved, with an operating loss of $1.6 million in 2007, compared with an operating loss of $9.2 million in the third quarter 2006.

The third-quarter 2007 earnings increase is the result of implementation of new rate schedules, which included $8.1 million in Kansas and $0.5 million in Texas. Operating costs were $91.6 million, compared with $88.8 million in the third quarter 2006, primarily as a result of higher bad debt expense in Oklahoma.
Operating income for the nine-month period in 2007 was $113.5 million, compared with $68.5 million in the same period last year. The increase is the result of new rate schedules, which included $36.7 million in Kansas and $3.9 million in Texas, and an increase of $10.3 million from higher customer sales volumes primarily as a result of a return to more normal weather patterns in the distribution segment's entire service territory.
Operating costs were $278.9 million for the 2007 nine-month period, compared with $270.9 million in the same period of 2006, due primarily to $4.9 million of higher bad debt expense in Oklahoma and $3.0 million of higher property taxes.
Residential and commercial volumes increased for the 2007 nine-month period, primarily due to more normal weather patterns when compared with the unseasonably warm winter weather in 2006. Wholesale volumes declined for the 2007 nine-month period as a result of reduced volumes available for sale.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported a third-quarter operating loss of $0.7 million, compared with operating income of $21.5 million in the same period in 2006. In the third quarter 2007, the segment experienced cooler weather, which resulted in lower natural gas power-generation demand and lower natural gas price volatility in the natural gas markets.
The earnings decline in the quarter was due primarily to a decrease of $16.7 million in transportation margins, which includes a $7.4 million impact from the Cheyenne Plains pipeline outage; and a decrease of $15.7 million in storage margins and increased storage fees, which were partially offset by higher demand fees collected. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $12.2 million in financial trading margins.
In mid-September 2007, Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company notified the company that a portion of the volume contracted under the company's firm transportation agreement was curtailed due to a force majeure event. This resulted in a loss of margin, which reduced the September physical transportation margins by $1.9 million and reduced the unrealized fair value of related transportation hedges for October and a portion of November by $5.5 million. Cheyenne Plains expects the pipeline to resume full operations in November 2007.
Nine-month operating income was $129.6 million, compared with $168.3 million for the same period last year. The decrease is primarily due to reduced transportation margins of $32.3 million resulting from reduced natural gas price volatility, a decrease in realized physical

margins in the Mid-Continent region and the third-quarter 2007 Cheyenne Plains outage. Storage margins also declined $3.5 million related to increases in storage fees on renewals and new capacity contracts, partially offset by higher realized spreads in the first quarter of 2007 and higher demand fees collected. Nine-month operating costs were $27.7 million, relatively unchanged from the same period a year earlier.
At Oct. 30, 2007, total natural gas in storage was approximately 92.3 Bcf. Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 96 Bcf in the third quarter 2007, compared with 86 Bcf in the same period 2006. Storage costs were higher in both the three- and nine-month periods 2007, compared with the prior year, primarily because of increased fees and more capacity under lease.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
