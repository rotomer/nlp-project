Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 25, 2008  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced that its fourth-quarter 2007 net income rose 38 percent to $102.9 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $74.6 million, or 66 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2006.
Net income for the full year 2007 was $304.9 million, or $2.79 per diluted share, compared with $306.3 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, a year earlier. 2006 results include ONEOK's share of ONEOK Partners' gain on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline Company, which had an after-tax impact of $32.3 million, or 28 cents per diluted share. Excluding the one-time gain, 2007 net income was up $30.9 million, or 11 percent.
"All of our businesses performed well in the fourth quarter and the year," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer.
"Our ONEOK Partners segment benefited from continued supply growth in our natural gas liquids (NGL) businesses, our October acquisition of an NGL and refined petroleum products pipeline and higher realized commodity prices," Gibson said. "Our distribution segment's performance was solid, benefiting from new rates in Kansas and Texas and a continued emphasis on cost control. The energy services segment turned in an exceptional quarter, driven by higher transportation, storage and marketing activities.
"In 2008, we will continue to see the benefits of ONEOK Partners' $1.6 billion investment in internal growth projects that will start to come on line this year," Gibson added. "And we will continue to focus on improving the profitability of our distribution segment."
Fourth-quarter operating income was $255.7 million in 2007, compared with $202.7 million in 2006, reflecting improvement in all three of the company's operating segments. ONEOK Partners benefited from higher commodity prices and the first quarter of earnings from the North System, an interstate NGL and refined petroleum products pipeline system acquired in October 2007. The distribution segment benefited from implementing new rate schedules in

Kansas and Texas. And, the energy services segment experienced higher transportation, storage and marketing margins.
Excluding gains on the sale of assets, full-year 2007 operating income increased to $820.6 million from $745.7 million in 2006. The distribution segment improved its margins by the implementation of new rate schedules in Kansas and Texas. ONEOK Partners increased its margins in its natural gas liquids businesses from new supply connections that increased NGL volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold; higher isomerization and product price spreads; and the first quarter of earnings from the recently acquired North System. These increases were partially offset by reduced transportation and financial trading margins in the energy services segment.
Operating costs for the year were $761.5 million, compared with $740.8 million in 2006. The increase is due to higher employee-related costs and the incremental operating expenses associated with the North System acquisition, and increased bad debt expense and higher property taxes in the distribution segment. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the year, compared with 2006, primarily as a result of a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $12.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to the Black Mesa Pipeline, which is included in the ONEOK Partners segment.

2007 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
The ONEOK Partners segment posted fourth-quarter operating income of $129.7 million versus $90.6 million in the same quarter 2006. The segment's natural gas gathering and processing business benefited from higher realized commodity prices and a favorable one-time contract settlement in the fourth quarter 2007. The fourth quarter also marked the first quarter of earnings from the recently acquired North System, an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related assets, which improved the performance of the natural gas liquids pipelines business.
Full-year operating income was $446.8 million in 2007, compared with $511.2 million in 2006. Operating income for 2006 includes the one-time gain on sale of assets of $113.9 million related to ONEOK Partners' sale of a 20 percent partnership interest in Northern Border Pipeline in April 2006. Excluding the gain on sale in 2006, operating income increased $49.5 million, or 12 percent, in 2007.
Full-year 2007 results reflect increased margins in the segment's natural gas liquids businesses, which benefited primarily from new supply connections that increased NGL volumes gathered, transported, fractionated and sold. The natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business also benefited from both higher product and isomerization price spreads, and the natural gas liquids pipelines business had incremental margin related to the recently acquired North System. These increases were partially offset by decreased natural gas processing and transportation margins in the partnership's natural gas businesses, due primarily to lower natural gas volumes processed and lower natural gas throughput as a result of various contract terminations in late 2006.

Operating costs were $337.4 million for the full year 2007, compared with $325.8 million in 2006, increasing primarily as a result of higher employee-related costs and incremental operating expenses associated with the recently acquired North System. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $8.3 million for 2007, compared with 2006, primarily due to a goodwill and asset impairment charge of $12.0 million related to the Black Mesa Pipeline recorded in the second quarter of 2006.
Equity earnings from investments for the full year 2007 were $89.9 million, compared with $95.9 million in the same period last year. The reduction is primarily due to ONEOK Partners' share of Northern Border Pipeline's earnings declining from 70 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to 50 percent beginning in the second quarter of 2006.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported fourth-quarter operating income of $60.7 million versus $49.0 million in the same quarter 2006.
The increase in fourth-quarter 2007 earnings is primarily the result of implementation of new rate schedules, which included $13.5 million in Kansas and $0.4 million in Texas, partially offset by reduced volumes due to the December ice storm in Oklahoma. Operating costs decreased to $98.8 million in the fourth quarter 2007 versus $100.6 million in 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.3 million in the fourth quarter 2007, compared with the same period last year.
The distribution segment reported 2007 operating income of $174.2 million, compared with $117.5 million last year. Net margin increased $63.9 million as a result of a $55.2 million increase from the implementation of new rate schedules, which includes $51.1 million in Kansas and $4.1 million in Texas; and an increase of $8.0 million from higher customer sales volumes due to a return to more normal weather in the distribution segment's entire service territory.
Operating costs for 2007 increased to $377.8 million, compared with $371.5 million in 2006, due to $4.8 million in higher bad debt expense, primarily in Oklahoma, and $5.3 million in higher property taxes in Kansas. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in employee-related costs.
Residential and commercial volumes increased during 2007, compared with 2006, due to a return to more normal weather from the unseasonably warm weather in 2006.
Energy Services
The energy services segment posted fourth-quarter operating income of $75.7 million versus $60.9 million in the same quarter 2006. The increase in earnings for the quarter was due

primarily to $10.3 million in improved transportation margins and $5.8 million in storage and marketing margins resulting from higher seasonal storage spreads and storage withdrawals, partially offset by $2.1 million in lower financial trading margins.
Full-year 2007 operating income was $205.3 million, compared with $229.2 million in 2006. The decrease is primarily due to reduced transportation margins of $14.1 million as a result of narrower location spreads; a $7.9 million impact from the third-quarter 2007 Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline outage; $5.0 million in lower retail margins due to market conditions; and $4.3 million in lower financial trading margins. These decreases were partially offset by $4.9 million in improved storage margins due to higher realized seasonal storage spreads and optimization activities, partially offset by increased storage fees.
Operating costs for the year decreased to $39.9 million, compared with $42.5 million in 2006, due primarily to lower legal and employee-related costs.
On Dec. 31, 2007, natural gas in storage was 66.7 Bcf, compared with 74.1 Bcf a year earlier. Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 96 Bcf on Dec. 31, 2007, compared with 86 Bcf in 2006.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
