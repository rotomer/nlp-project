99.1    News release issued by ONEOK, Inc., April 30, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
TULSA, Okla.  April 30, 2008  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced first-quarter 2008 net income of $143.8 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared with $152.9 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
"All three business segments turned in solid performances this quarter," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer. "ONEOK Partners had an exceptionally strong quarter, driven by increased volumes, higher commodity prices and wider commodity spreads. Colder weather and increased volumes in our Oklahoma and Kansas service territories benefited our distribution segment. Our energy services segment also performed well in the first quarter, although results are down compared with last year, primarily as a result of lower marketing and storage margins.
"We also increased our ownership of ONEOK Partners to 47.7 percent, providing ONEOK with a larger share of the partnership's current earnings and positioning us for additional future earnings through the $1.6 billion in internally generated growth projects currently under way at the partnership," Gibson added.
ONEOK also reaffirmed its 2008 net income guidance, announced on Jan. 8, 2008, in the range of $2.75 to $3.15 per diluted share.
Operating income for the first quarter 2008 was $333.1 million, compared with $328.3 million for the first quarter 2007. The earnings increase is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and wider NGL product price spreads in the ONEOK Partners segment, as well as higher volumes. This increase was offset by reduced marketing and storage margins in the energy services segment, driven primarily by colder than anticipated weather.
Operating costs were $193.3 million in the first quarter 2008, compared with $182.3 million in the first quarter 2007, primarily as a result of incremental operating expenses associated with ONEOK Partners' North System, an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system that was acquired in October 2007, as well as costs incurred to comply with regulations and higher employee-related costs.

Equity earnings from investments increased $3.7 million to $27.8 million in the first quarter 2008, compared with the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of higher throughput on Northern Border Pipeline, in which ONEOK Partners has a 50 percent ownership interest.

FIRST-QUARTER 2008 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
First-quarter 2008 operating income increased 44 percent to $150.5 million, compared with $104.4 million in the same period last year.
The first-quarter 2008 operating income increase is primarily the result of higher commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business and wider regional NGL product price spreads in the natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business. Also, both the natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses experienced higher volumes than in the previous year, primarily due to new supply connections and the recently acquired North System.
First-quarter 2008 operating costs were $88.1 million, compared with $75.7 million in the first quarter 2007. The increase is primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the recently acquired North System, as well as costs incurred to comply with regulations and higher employee-related costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.4 million, compared with the same period last year, also primarily due to the North System acquisition.
Equity earnings from investments for the first quarter 2008 increased to $27.8 million, compared with $24.1 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily as a result of higher throughput from ONEOK Partners' 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $108.5 million in the first quarter 2008, compared with operating income of $103.2 million in the first quarter 2007.
First-quarter 2008 earnings increased as a result of colder temperatures and increased volumes in the Oklahoma and Kansas service territories. Transportation volumes were strong in Oklahoma and Kansas and improved margins by $2.5 million. Residential margins were moderated by weather normalization mechanisms and reflect an increase of $1.2 million from the implementation of new rate schedules.
Operating costs decreased to $94.2 million, compared with $95.7 million in the first quarter 2007, primarily as a result of lower employee-related costs.
Energy Services
Energy Services reported first-quarter operating income of $74.3 million, compared with operating income of $120.1 million in the same period in 2007.

The first-quarter 2008 earnings decline is due primarily to a decrease of $47.9 million in marketing and storage margins. Colder than anticipated weather in the first quarter 2008 increased supply requirements of customers, leaving less volume available for the segment's marketing optimization activities. With lower volumes available, combined with steadily increasing natural gas prices, storage optimization margins were also reduced. In addition, financial trading margins were down $7.8 million, partially offset by an increase of $7.0 million in transportation margins and an increase of $2.2 million in retail marketing activities.
Operating costs for the quarter were $10.2 million, relatively flat compared with the same period a year earlier.
At March 31, 2008, total natural gas in storage was 14.6 Bcf, compared with 37.3 Bcf a year earlier. Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 96 Bcf in the first quarter of 2008, compared with 88 Bcf in the same period 2007.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
