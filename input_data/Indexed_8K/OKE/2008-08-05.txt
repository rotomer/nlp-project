On August 5, 2008, we announced our results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. The news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Aug. 5, 2008  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced that its second-quarter 2008 net income rose 19 percent to $41.9 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, compared with $35.2 million, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Net income for the six-month period ending June 30, 2008, was $185.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared with $188.1 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
"ONEOK's performance was driven by continued strong results in our ONEOK Partners segment, which has had another exceptional quarter as a result of higher commodity prices and increased volumes," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer. "New rate mechanisms in Oklahoma continue to benefit our distribution segment. Our energy services segment had lower than expected results due to reduced transportation margins.
"Some of the internally generated growth projects in ONEOK Partners are beginning to come on line, as anticipated, providing additional income opportunities to ONEOK and long-term value to our shareholders," Gibson added.
ONEOK raised its 2008 net income guidance to the range of $2.90 to $3.10 per diluted share from the range of $2.75 to $3.15 per diluted share. The ONEOK Partners segment's guidance was increased to reflect its strong performance in the first half of 2008, combined with the current commodity price environment and hedges in place. The distribution segment's 2008 income guidance has also increased, reflecting the strong performance in the first half of the year, and the energy services segment's guidance has been reduced to reflect lower first-half 2008 results and lower anticipated transportation, storage and marketing margins. Additional information is available in exhibit A.
Operating income for the second quarter 2008 was $173.0 million, compared with $135.7 million for the second quarter 2007. The earnings increase was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices and increased NGL volumes due to new supply connections in the ONEOK Partners segment, as well as earnings from the partnership's North System, an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system that was acquired in October 2007.

This increase was partially offset by reduced transportation margins in the energy services segment, primarily from decreased transportation basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.
Year-to-date 2008 operating income increased to $506.1 million, compared with $464.0 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to ONEOK Partners' higher realized commodity prices, increased NGL volumes, wider NGL product price differentials and incremental earnings received from the North System. In addition, the distribution segment benefited from new rate mechanisms in Oklahoma and Texas. These increases were partially offset by the energy services segment, which experienced lower transportation, storage and marketing margins than in the previous year.
Operating costs were $188.1 million in the second quarter 2008, compared with $175.9 million in the second quarter 2007. Operating costs for the first six months 2008 were $381.4 million, compared with $358.2 million in the same period last year. Operating costs increased for the three- and six-month periods, primarily as a result of operating expenses associated with ONEOK Partners' acquisition of the North System, as well as increased general operating and employee-related costs in the ONEOK Partners segment.

SECOND-QUARTER 2008 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
The ONEOK Partners segment's second-quarter 2008 operating income increased 52 percent to $163.7 million, compared with $107.6 million in the second quarter last year. For the first six months 2008, operating income increased 48 percent to $314.3 million, compared with $211.9 million in the same period a year earlier.
The second-quarter and year-to-date 2008 operating income increases were primarily due to higher realized commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business and increased volumes from new supply connections and wider regional product price differentials in the natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business. In addition, earnings increased in the natural gas liquids pipelines business primarily due to the North System acquired last fall.
Second-quarter 2008 operating costs were $87.2 million, compared with $81.6 million in the second quarter 2007. Six-month 2008 operating costs were $175.2 million, compared with $157.3 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in operating costs for the three- and six-month periods was primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the North System, as well as increased expenses associated with outside services, chemicals and employee-related costs.
Equity earnings from investments for the second quarter 2008 were $17.6 million, compared with $18.8 million in the same period a year earlier. The decrease was primarily a result of lower throughput from ONEOK Partners' 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
Equity earnings from investments for the 2008 six-month period increased to $45.4 million, compared with $42.8 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily due to higher gathering revenues in ONEOK Partners' natural gas gathering and processing investments in the Rocky Mountain region.

Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $12.0 million in the second quarter 2008, compared with operating income of $11.8 million in the second quarter 2007.
Second-quarter 2008 earnings increased as a result of the implementation of new capital and expense recovery mechanisms, which includes $3.8 million in Oklahoma. This increase was partially offset by higher operating costs, which were $93.9 million in the second quarter 2008, compared with $91.6 million in the second quarter 2007. The higher operating costs were primarily the result of a $3.3 million non-recurring expense reimbursement in 2007, partially offset by a reduction of $1.1 million in bad debt expense in Oklahoma and Texas during the second quarter 2008.
For the six months, operating income was $120.6 million, compared with $115.0 million in the same period a year earlier.
Six-month 2008 results reflect the implementation of new rate mechanisms, including $6.1 million in Oklahoma, primarily due to new capital and expense recovery mechanisms, and $1.3 million in Texas. Both residential and transportation volumes increased, compared with the same period in 2007. Colder temperatures in the Oklahoma and Kansas services territories resulted in the increased residential volumes.
Six-month 2008 operating costs were $188.1 million, relatively flat compared with costs in the same period a year earlier.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported a second-quarter operating loss of $4.4 million, compared with operating income of $10.2 million in the same period in 2007.
The second-quarter 2008 earnings decline was the result of a decrease of $18.9 million in transportation margins, primarily due to decreased transportation basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions. This was partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in financial trading margins and an increase of $1.9 million in storage and marketing margins.
Operating income for the six months was $69.9 million, compared with operating income of $130.3 million in the same period in 2007.
The six-month 2008 earnings decline was due primarily to $46.1 million in reduced storage and marketing margins, $11.9 million in reduced transportation margins and $4.9 million in reduced financial trading margins. Commodity prices and weather provided a more favorable environment during the first half of 2007, which improved storage margins during that period.

Transportation margins declined primarily due to decreased transportation basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions. These decreases were partially offset by $1.4 million in improved retail margins.
At June 30, 2008, total natural gas in storage was 41.2 bcf, compared with 64.4 bcf a year earlier. At July 31, 2008, total natural gas in storage was 50.2 bcf. Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 91 bcf in the second quarter of 2008, compared with 96 bcf in the same period 2007.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
