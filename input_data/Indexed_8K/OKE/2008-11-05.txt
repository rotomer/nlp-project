Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 5, 2008  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced third-quarter 2008 net income of $58.0 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, compared with $13.9 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Net income for the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2008, was $243.7 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $202.0 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
The company also affirmed its 2008 net income guidance, but narrowed the range to $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share, reflecting stronger nine-month performance in the ONEOK Partners segment, partially offset by anticipated lower operating income in the energy services segment. ONEOK's previous 2008 earnings guidance was estimated to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.10 per diluted share. Additional information is available in Exhibit A.
"Our quarterly performance was driven by the exceptional results in our ONEOK Partners segment, clearly demonstrating the benefit ONEOK Partners provides to ONEOK," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer.
"Our ONEOK Partners segment's exceptional performance was the result of volume growth and wider natural gas liquids product price differentials in its natural gas liquids businesses, and higher commodity prices and volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing business. In addition, for the nine months, our distribution segment benefited from new rate mechanisms and cost controls that we successfully implemented," Gibson added.
Operating income for the third quarter 2008 was $192.2 million, compared with $102.8 million for the third quarter 2007. The increase was primarily due to wider NGL product price differentials and higher realized commodity prices in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Year-to-date 2008 operating income increased to $698.3 million, compared with $566.8 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to ONEOK Partners' higher realized commodity prices, wider NGL product price differentials, increased NGL throughput and incremental earnings from the North System, an interstate natural gas liquids and

refined petroleum products pipeline system that was acquired in October 2007. In addition, rate mechanisms in Oklahoma and Texas benefited the distribution segment during the 2008 nine-month period. These increases were partially offset by the energy services segment, which experienced lower storage, marketing and transportation margins than in the previous year.
"Through our ONEOK Partners segment, we realized higher margins in the favorable commodity price environment in the first nine months of 2008. In the fourth quarter, we are experiencing a return to more normal NGL product differentials and commodity prices," Gibson added.
Operating costs were $203.9 million in the third quarter 2008, compared with $181.1 million in the third quarter 2007. Operating costs for the nine months 2008 were $585.3 million, compared with $539.3 million in the same period last year. Operating costs increased for the three- and nine-month periods, primarily as a result of incremental operating expenses associated with ONEOK Partners' acquisition of the North System, as well as increased employee-related costs.
In response to uncertainties in the capital markets, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners took proactive measures to increase their available cash by drawing down their respective revolving credit facilities to provide funding for working capital requirements and growth projects.
At Oct. 31, 2008, ONEOK had $1.4 billion outstanding and $115 million available under its revolving credit facilities and approximately $335 million in available cash and cash equivalents. The additional funds and remaining borrowing capacity, as well as operating cash flow, will fund ONEOK's capital requirements for the remainder of the winter heating season.
At Oct. 31, 2008, ONEOK Partners had $870 million outstanding and $130 million available under its revolving credit facility and approximately $396 million in available cash and cash equivalents. The additional funds and remaining borrowing capacity, as well as operating cash flow, will fund the partnership's capital requirements for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009.
"Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow have served us well, especially in today's challenging financial markets, providing us with the resources and financial flexibility to operate and continue to grow our business," Gibson added.

THIRD-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 2008 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
The ONEOK Partners segment's third-quarter 2008 operating income increased 88 percent to $197.5 million, compared with $105.1 million in the same period 2007.
Third-quarter 2008 results, when compared with the same period in 2007, included $43.7 million from wider regional NGL product price differentials, $13.3 million in operational measurement gains primarily at NGL storage caverns, and $12.5 million from increased volumes in its NGL gathering and fractionation business; $18.3 million from higher realized commodity

prices in the partnership's natural gas gathering and processing business; and $12.0 million of incremental margins from the acquired North System.
Third-quarter 2008 operating costs were $97.5 million, compared with $80.1 million in the third quarter 2007. The increase was primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the North System and higher employee-related costs.
For the nine months, operating income was $511.8 million, compared with $317.1 million in the same period a year earlier.
Nine-month 2008 results, when compared with the same period in 2007, included $66.2 million from higher realized commodity prices in the partnership's natural gas gathering and processing business; $59.3 million from wider regional NGL product price differentials and $31.8 million from increased volumes in its NGL gathering and fractionation business; and $34.0 million of incremental margins from the North System.
Nine-month 2008 operating costs were $272.7 million, compared with $237.4 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the North System and higher employee-related costs.
Equity earnings from investments for the third quarter 2008 were $29.4 million, compared with $22.2 million in 2007. Equity earnings from investments for the nine months 2008 were $74.8 million, compared with $65.0 million in the same period a year earlier. The third-quarter and nine-month increases were primarily due to a gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline, of which ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest, as well as higher gathering revenues in its various investments, partially offset by lower throughput on Northern Border Pipeline.
Capital expenditures for the nine months 2008 increased to $860.2 million, compared with $408.4 million in the same period in 2007, as a result of the partnership's internally generated growth projects.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported an operating loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter 2008, compared with a loss of $1.6 million in the third quarter 2007.
Third-quarter 2008 earnings benefited from new rate mechanisms, which contributed $3.9 million in Oklahoma and $1.0 million in Texas. These increases were offset by higher operating costs, which increased to $97.6 million in the third quarter 2008 from $91.6 million in the third quarter 2007. The higher operating costs resulted primarily from $3.2 million of higher employee-related costs and $1.2 million from higher fuel-related vehicle costs.

Operating income for the 2008 nine-month period was $117.7 million, compared with $113.5 million in the same period last year. Operating income increased primarily because of the implementation of new capital and expense recovery mechanisms of $10.0 million in Oklahoma and new rates of $2.3 million in Texas.
Operating costs were $285.6 million for the 2008 nine-month period, compared with $278.9 million in the same period of 2007. The higher operating costs were primarily the result of a $3.3 million non-recurring expense reimbursement in 2007, $2.1 million in higher employee-related costs and $1.5 million in higher fuel-related vehicle costs.
Capital expenditures for the nine months 2008 increased to $126.4 million, compared with $108.7 million in the same period in 2007, due to the timing of system maintenance expenditures.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported a third-quarter operating loss of $3.5 million, compared with a loss of $0.7 million in the same period in 2007.
Third-quarter 2008 results, when compared with the same period in 2007, reflect a $9.9 million decrease in financial trading margins, partially offset by a $7.5 million increase in storage and marketing margins, primarily due to a more favorable pricing environment that benefited optimization activities. Included in the third-quarter storage and marketing margins was a $9.7 million net loss to reflect natural gas in inventory at the lower of cost or market.
Nine-month operating income was $66.4 million, compared with $129.6 million for the same period last year.
Nine-month 2008 results were lower, when compared with the same period a year earlier, primarily due to decreases of $38.6 million in storage and marketing margins, $14.8 million in financial trading margins and $11.7 million in transportation margins. Nine-month 2008 transportation margins decreased, primarily due to a reduction in the basis differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions. During the nine-month 2007 period, commodity prices and weather provided a more favorable environment, which improved storage margins.
At Sept. 30, 2008, total natural gas in storage was 74.7 bcf, compared with 80.1 bcf a year earlier. At Oct. 31, 2008, total natural gas in storage was approximately 84.5 bcf. Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 91 bcf in the third quarter 2008, compared with 96 bcf in the same period in 2007.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
