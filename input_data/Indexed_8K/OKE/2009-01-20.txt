(c)           Notice of any meeting of shareholders shall not be required to be given to any shareholder who shall have waived such notice, and such notice shall be deemed waived by any shareholder who shall have submitted a written waiver of notice or who shall have attended such meeting in person or by proxy, except a shareholder who shall have attended such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock.  Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation shall have expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or the pledgees proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon.  Shares having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation Act.
(c)           A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for the shareholder by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  The following shall constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant such authority:
(i)           by executing a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the shareholder or the shareholders authorized officer, director, employee, agent or other authorized person signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or
(ii)           by authorizing another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy by transmitting or authorizing transmission of a facsimile, electronic mail, telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission capable of being reduced to writing to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission; provided, that any facsimile, electronic mail, telegram, cablegram, or other acceptable means of electronic transmission must either set forth, or be submitted with information from which it can be determined, that such transmission was authorized by the shareholder.  If it is determined that a facsimile, electronic mail, telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, any other person making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.
Any copy, facsimile, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this subsection may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided, that the copy, facsimile, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

(d)           The attendance at any meeting by a shareholder who may theretofore have given a proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless the shareholder shall in writing so notify the secretary of the meeting prior to the voting of a proxy.
(e)           At any meeting of the shareholders, all matters, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, in the By-laws or by law, and except for the election of directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat and thereon, provided that a quorum is present.  With respect to the election of directors at any meeting of the shareholders, each nominee shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that directors election by the shareholders present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote for the election of directors, provided that a quorum is present and, provided further, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of shareholders for which (i) the secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a shareholder has nominated a person for election to the Board in compliance with the advance notice requirements for shareholder nominees for director set forth in Section 3.03(c) and (d) of these By-laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such shareholder on or before the tenth (10) day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the shareholders.  The vote at any meeting of the shareholders on any matter need not be by written ballot, except election of directors, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting.

  In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.  If no record date is fixed by the directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.  In order that the Corporation may determine shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation.  If, in any case involving the determination of shareholders for any purpose other than notice of or voting at a meeting of shareholders, the Board shall not fix a record date, the record date for determining shareholders for such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto.

The termination of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was unlawful.

incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article VIII, to the extent that a present or former director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in Sections 8.01 and 8.02, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

Any indemnification under Sections 8.01 or 8.02 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02.  Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (ii) by a committee of directors designated by a majority vote of directors, even though less than a quorum; (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (iv) by the shareholders.

Such expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by former directors or officers or other employees and agents may be so paid under such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board may deem appropriate.
Section 8.05 Advance of Expenses.  
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
Section 8.06 Provisions of By-laws not Exclusive.
