TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 23, 2009  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today reported higher 2008 net income, which increased to $311.9 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, from $304.9 million, or $2.79 per diluted share, a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter 2008 net income was $68.2 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $102.9 million, or 98 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2007.
Our ONEOK Partners segment had a record year in 2008, driven by continued volume growth, as well as high commodity prices and wider NGL product price differentials, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer. In the first nine months of 2008, we saw unprecedented commodity price levels, which began falling in the fourth quarter.  The partnership benefited from these higher prices, but we anticipate lower prices in 2009.
Our distribution segment also had a record year as we continued to implement rate strategies and focused on operating efficiencies to improve financial performance.  Our energy services segment had a challenging year in 2008, adversely affected by the commodity markets and weather, said Gibson. However, we are continuing with our efforts to improve this business  to have more predictable, less volatile earnings and lower working capital requirements  while continuing to serve our customers.
Our ONEOK Partners segment turned in a solid fourth-quarter performance, despite challenges in the energy and financial markets during the second half of the year, Gibson added. Our distribution segments performance improved as expected in the quarter, with results in our energy services segment reflecting reduced storage and transportation margins.
ONEOKs fourth-quarter operating income was $218.7 million in 2008, compared with $255.7 million in 2007, reflecting a decrease in storage, marketing and transportation margins in the energy services segment.
ONEOKs 2008 operating income increased to $917.0 million from $822.5 million in 2007.  The increase is primarily due to the record performance in the ONEOK Partners segment,
which benefited from significantly wider NGL product price differentials, higher realized commodity prices, increased volumes and incremental net margin associated with the North System, an interstate natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system that was acquired in October 2007.  In addition, the distribution segment contributed higher earnings in 2008, due to the implementation of new rate mechanisms and operating efficiencies.  These increases were partially offset by lower storage, marketing and transportation margins in the energy services segment.
Operating costs for the year were $776.9 million, compared with $761.5 million in 2007.  The increase is primarily due to incremental operating expenses associated with the acquired North System and higher operating costs at ONEOK Partners fractionation facilities.
2008 SUMMARY INCLUDES:
2008 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS
ONEOK Partners
 
The ONEOK Partners segment posted fourth-quarter operating income of $133.0 million, compared with $129.7 million in the same quarter 2007.
 
 
The increase in fourth-quarter earnings comes primarily from the natural gas liquids pipelines business, which increased $12.1 million from higher volumes, which included $10.3 million from increased volumes on the North System.  In addition, the Overland Pass Pipeline became fully operational during the fourth quarter.  ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business benefited $11.4 million from wider NGL product price differentials.  These increases were partially offset by reduced earnings in its natural gas gathering and processing business, as a result of $7.8 million from lower commodity prices and $8.6 million from a one-time favorable contract settlement in 2007.  Depreciation expense increased $5.0 million in 2008, compared with the fourth quarter 2007, associated with the partnerships completed capital projects.
 
For the year, operating income increased 44 percent to $644.8 million, compared with $446.8 million in 2007.
Full-year 2008 results reflect a $70.8 million increase in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business, as a result of significantly wider NGL product price differentials and a $32.1 million increase from higher NGL gathering and fractionation volumes. The natural gas gathering and processing business increased $58.4 million due to higher realized
commodity prices.  The natural gas liquids pipelines business benefited $44.3 million from the North System - which included $10.3 million from higher fourth-quarter volumes - and $4.3 million from higher volumes on other pipelines.  The natural gas pipelines business benefited $11.7 million from higher transportation and storage margins, primarily due to the impact of natural gas prices on retained fuel, and new and renegotiated storage contracts.
Operating costs for the ONEOK Partners segment were $371.8 million for the full year 2008, compared with $337.4 million in 2007, increasing primarily as a result of incremental operating expenses associated with the North System and higher operating costs at ONEOK Partners fractionation facilities.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $11.1 million for 2008, compared with 2007, primarily due to depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners completed capital projects and the acquired North System.
The ONEOK Partners segments equity earnings from investments for the full year 2008 were $101.4 million, compared with $89.9 million in the same period last year.  The increase is primarily due to higher gathering revenues in ONEOK Partners various investments, as well as an $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline, partially offset by reduced volumes on Northern Border Pipeline.  ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent equity interest in Northern Border Pipeline.
The ONEOK Partners segments capital expenditures for the year ending Dec. 31, 2008, increased to $1.3 billion, compared with $709.9 million in the same period in 2007, as a result of the partnerships internal growth projects.  During 2008, ONEOK Partners completed a number of growth projects, including the Overland Pass Pipeline, related NGL infrastructure upgrades, an NGL pipeline extension into the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma, the Fort Union Gas Gathering expansion and Midwestern Gas Transmissions eastern extension pipeline.  In addition, the partnership placed the Guardian Pipeline extension and expansion in partial service in December 2008 and full service is expected during the first quarter of 2009.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported fourth-quarter 2008 operating income of $71.2 million versus $60.7 million in the same quarter 2007.
Fourth-quarter 2008 earnings benefited from new rate mechanisms, which contributed $2.5 million in Oklahoma and $1.0 million in Texas.  Operating costs decreased to $89.7 million in the fourth quarter 2008 versus $98.8 million in the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.
The distribution segment reported record 2008 operating income of $188.8 million, compared with $174.1 million last year.  The increase resulted primarily from the
implementation of new rate mechanisms, which included a $12.4 million increase in Oklahoma from new capital and expense recovery mechanisms, and a $3.3 million increase in Texas.
Operating costs for 2008 decreased to $375.3 million, compared with $377.8 million in 2007, primarily due to $4.3 million in lower employee-related costs and $1.0 million in lower bad-debt expense, partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in fuel-related vehicle costs.
Residential and commercial volumes increased during 2008, compared with 2007, due to colder temperatures in the Oklahoma and Kansas service territories; however, margins were moderated by weather normalization mechanisms.
Energy Services
The energy services segment posted fourth-quarter operating income of $9.3 million versus $75.7 million in the same quarter 2007.
Fourth-quarter 2008 results, when compared with the same period in 2007, reflect a decrease of $44.7 million in storage and marketing margins as a result of less favorable pricing conditions in 2008, and a decrease of $28.7 million in transportation margins primarily due to narrower natural gas price differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.
Operating costs decreased $4.6 million for the quarter, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.
Energy services full-year 2008 operating income was $75.7 million, compared with $205.4 million in 2007.  Compared with the same period a year earlier, 2008 results were lower primarily due to a decrease of $83.3 million in storage and marketing margins, which included hedging activities and a $9.7 million net loss to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market in the third quarter 2008.  In addition, transportation margins decreased $40.3 million, and financial trading margins decreased $13.9 million from the same period in 2007.
During 2008, commodity prices and weather provided a less favorable operating environment, which lowered storage margins when compared with 2007.  The realized seasonal storage differential in 2008 was 96 cents per MMBtu, compared with $1.94 per MMBtu realized in 2007.  Reductions in the transportation margins in 2008 were primarily due to narrower natural gas price differentials between the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions.
Operating costs for the year decreased to $35.6 million, compared with $39.9 million in 2007, due primarily to lower employee-related costs.
On Dec. 31, 2008, natural gas in storage was 81.9 Bcf, compared with 66.7 Bcf a year earlier.  At Jan. 31, 2009, natural gas in storage was 62.6 Bcf.  Natural gas storage capacity under lease was 91 Bcf on Dec. 31, 2008, compared with 96 Bcf in 2007.
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
