Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  April 29, 2009  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced first-quarter 2009 earnings of $1.16 per diluted share, compared with $1.36 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Net income attributable to ONEOK was $122.3 million in the first quarter 2009, compared with $143.8 million in the same period in 2008.
 
ONEOK also reaffirmed its 2009 earnings per share guidance, announced on Feb. 5, 2009, in the range of $2.25 to $2.75 per diluted share.
 
The distribution segment had a great quarter as we continue to see the benefits from the successful execution of our rate strategies and cost-control initiatives, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer.  We are also pleased that both our ONEOK Partners and energy services segments turned in strong performances, despite the difficult economic conditions and significantly lower commodity prices.
 
Continued positive free cash flow enabled us to further reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet.  With strong liquidity and no debt maturities until 2011, we have the financial flexibility to perform well in a challenging economic environment and make the investments necessary to drive the companys continued success, Gibson added.
 
First-quarter 2009 operating income was $293.0 million, compared with $333.1 million for the first quarter 2008.  The decrease was due primarily to lower realized commodity prices and narrower natural gas liquids (NGL) product price differentials in the ONEOK Partners segment, and lower transportation, storage and marketing margins in the energy services segment.  These decreases were partially offset by the implementation of new rate mechanisms in the distribution segment and increased NGL volumes in the ONEOK Partners segment, due, in part, to the Overland Pass Pipeline, which began operations in the fourth quarter 2008.
 
First-quarter 2009 operating costs decreased to $186.9 million, compared with $193.3 million in the same period last year, primarily as a result of lower bad-debt expenses in the distribution segment and reduced general operating costs.  These decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs at ONEOK Partners fractionation facilities, which included costs from

The first-quarter 2009 results decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices, which reduced the natural gas gathering and processing business results by $27.5 million, and narrower NGL product price differentials and lower NGL marketing margins, which reduced the natural gas liquids gathering and fractionation business results by $16.5 million.  These decreases were partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in the natural gas liquids businesses due to increased throughput in the partnerships NGL gathering, distribution and fractionation facilities, driven by the Overland Pass Pipeline, which began operations in the fourth quarter 2008, and by new supply connections.
 
First-quarter 2009 operating costs were $89.4 million, compared with $88.1 million in the first quarter 2008.  Operating costs increased at fractionation facilities, due, in part, to the recently expanded Bushton fractionator, and incremental expenses associated with the Overland Pass Pipeline.  These increases were partially offset by lower general operating costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $39.9 million, compared with $29.9 million in the same period in 2008, primarily due to incremental expenses associated with the partnerships completed capital projects.
 
Equity earnings from investments for the first quarter 2009 were $21.2 million, compared with $27.8 million in the same period a year earlier, primarily as a result of lower revenues in ONEOK Partners various natural gas gathering and processing investments and in the Northern Border Pipeline, of which the partnership owns 50 percent.
 
Distribution
 
The distribution segment reported operating income of $112.9 million in the first quarter 2009, compared with $108.5 million in the first quarter 2008.
 
First-quarter 2009 results increased as a result of the implementation of new rate mechanisms of $2.4 million in Oklahoma, $0.7 million in Kansas and $0.7 million in Texas, compared with the same period last year.  These increases were partially offset by $1.9 million in lower sales volumes due to warmer weather across the segments three-state service territory.
 
First-quarter 2009 operating costs decreased to $90.1 million, compared with $94.2 million in the first quarter 2008, primarily as a result of $2.9 million in reduced bad-debt expenses across the segments service territory, as well as lower employee-related costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense was $31.6 million in the first quarter 2009, compared with $29.0 million in the same period last year.
 
Residential natural gas volumes sold were lower in the first quarter 2009, compared with the same period last year, due to warmer temperatures in the segments entire service territory; however, the impact on margins was moderated by weather-normalization mechanisms.

Energy Services
 
Energy Services reported first-quarter 2009 operating income of $54.9 million, compared with $74.3 million in the same period in 2008.
 
The decrease in first-quarter 2009 earnings, compared with the prior-year period, is due to $16.0 million in reduced transportation margins, net of hedging activities, primarily as a result of lower Mid-Continent-to-Gulf Coast region margins; and $12.5 million in reduced storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage differentials; partially offset by an increase of $7.0 million in financial trading margins.
 
At March 31, 2009, total natural gas in storage was 45.8 Bcf, compared with 14.6 Bcf a year earlier.  Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 91 Bcf in the first quarter of 2009, compared with 96 Bcf in the same period 2008.  At May 1, 2009, total natural gas storage capacity under lease will be 82.5 Bcf.
 
The net margin for the energy services segment was derived from the following sources:
