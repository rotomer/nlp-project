Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 3, 2009  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced third-quarter 2009 net income attributable to ONEOK of $48.0 million, or 45 cents per diluted share, compared with $58.0 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
Net income attributable to ONEOK for the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2009, was $212.0 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, compared with $243.7 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
The company also increased its 2009 net income guidance to the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per diluted share to reflect higher expected operating income performance in the distribution and energy services segments.  ONEOKs previous 2009 earnings guidance was in the range of $2.40 to $2.70 per diluted share.  Additional information is available in Exhibit A.
 
Our energy services segment had a strong quarter, building on its solid second-quarter performance, benefiting from higher W. Gibson, ONEOK chief executive officer.  The distribution segment also turned in a solid performance as a result of implementing new rate mechanisms.  Our ONEOK Partners segment benefited from the recently completed Overland Pass and Arbuckle natural gas liquids pipelines, which helped offset the impact of lower commodity prices and narrower natural gas liquids product price differentials.

and our continued efforts to reduce this segments earnings volatility
 
ONEOK continues to benefit from its investment in ONEOK Partners, which successfully completed more than $2 billion in capital investments at the end of the third quarter, providing the company with solid earnings and cash flow growth, Gibson added.  These projects, together with additional opportunities the partnership has identified over the next five years, are expected to drive additional growth at the partnership and at ONEOK.
 
Operating income for the third quarter 2009 was $173.8 million, compared with $192.2 million for the third quarter 2008.  For the nine months 2009, operating income was $621.6 million, compared with $698.3 million for the same period last year.

The operating income decreases in both the three- and nine-month 2009 periods were due primarily to lower realized commodity prices and narrower natural gas liquids (NGL) product price differentials in the ONEOK Partners segment.  The decreases were partially offset by increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, transported and marketed, associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline, and increased natural gas volumes processed and sold in the ONEOK Partners segment; increased transportation margins in the energy services segment; and the implementation of new rate mechanisms in the distribution segment.
 
Third-quarter 2009 operating costs were $204.6 million, compared with $203.9 million in the third quarter 2008.  Nine-month 2009 operating costs were $601.7 million, compared with $585.3 million in the same period last year.  These increases were due primarily to incremental operating expenses in the ONEOK Partners segment, associated with the Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline and increased costs at NGL fractionation facilities, including the expanded Bushton fractionator, and higher employee-related costs.  These increases were partially offset by lower bad-debt expense in the distribution segment.

THIRD-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 2009 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
 
ONEOK Partners
The ONEOK Partners segments third-quarter 2009 operating income was $144.7 million, compared with $197.5 million in the same period 2008.
 
Third-quarter 2009 results were lower, compared with the prior-year period, primarily as the result of a $33.7 million decrease from lower realized commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business; a $28.0 million decrease from narrower NGL product price differentials; and an $11.6 million decrease from prior-year operational measurement gains in the natural gas liquids business.
 
These decreases were partially offset by an $18.2 million increase in NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new supply connections in the natural gas liquids business; an $11.4 million increase from higher natural gas volumes processed and sold in the natural gas gathering and processing business; and a $10.1 million increase from higher natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in February 2009 and from an increase in contracted volumes on Midwestern Gas Transmission in the natural gas pipelines business.

For the nine-month 2009 period, operating income was $394.4 million, compared with $511.8 million in the same period a year earlier.
 
Nine-month 2009 results, compared with the same period in 2008, include a $95.1 million decrease due to significantly lower realized commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business; a $38.4 million decrease from narrower NGL product price differentials; and a $12.5 million decrease due to prior-year operational measurement gains in the natural gas liquids business.
 
These operating income decreases were partially offset by a $46.2 million increase due to higher NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported,  primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new supply connections in the natural gas liquids business; a $23.3 million increase from higher natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in February 2009 and from an increase in contracted volumes on Midwestern Gas Transmission in the natural gas pipelines business; and a $20.1 million increase due to higher natural gas volumes processed and sold in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
Third-quarter 2009 operating costs were $105.1 million, compared with $97.5 million in the third quarter 2008.  Nine-month 2009 operating costs were $295.0 million, compared with $272.7 million in the same period a year earlier.  Operating costs for the three- and nine-month 2009 periods reflect increased incremental operating expenses associated with the operation of Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline, and increased costs at fractionation facilities, which includes the expanded Bushton fractionator.
 
Equity earnings from investments for the third quarter 2009 were $20.1 million, compared with $29.4 million in 2008.  Equity earnings from investments for the nine months 2009 were $55.5 million, compared with $74.8 million in the same period a year earlier.
 
For the three- and nine-month 2009 periods, equity earnings decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline, in which ONEOK Partners has a 50 percent interest.  Third-quarter and nine-month 2008 results included an $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline.  Additionally, equity earnings from investments decreased due to lower volumes gathered at various natural gas gathering and processing investments in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.

Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $7.6 million in the third quarter 2009, compared with an operating loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter 2008.
 
Third-quarter 2009 earnings benefited from new rate mechanisms, which contributed $2.0 million in Oklahoma, $1.2 million in Kansas and $1.2 million in Texas.  Operating costs decreased to $91.0 million in the third quarter 2009 from $97.6 million in the third quarter 2008, due primarily to a $3.8 million decrease in bad-debt expense and a $2.1 million decrease in vehicle-related costs.
 
Operating income for the 2009 nine-month period was $130.3 million, compared with $117.7 million in the same period last year.
 
Nine-month 2009 operating income benefited from new rate mechanisms, which contributed $4.8 million in Oklahoma, $5.4 million in Kansas and $2.6 million in Texas; and a $2.2 million increase related to the recovery of the carrying costs of natural gas in storage.  These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in lower natural gas sales volumes due to warmer weather across the segments entire service territory and a $1.9 million decrease in transportation margins.
 
Operating costs were $280.5 million for the 2009 nine-month period, compared with $285.6 million in the same period of 2008.  The operating costs decreased as a result of $9.6 million in reduced bad-debt expense and $3.8 million in lower vehicle-related costs.  These lower costs were partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in employee-related costs and $1.9 million increase in property tax expense.
 
Capital expenditures for the nine months 2009 were $110.9 million, compared with $126.4 million in the same period in 2008.  Capital expenditures decreased, primarily as a result of timing and lower spending on modifications to customer service lines, general replacements and improvements, as well as lower spending on growth projects during 2009.
 
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported third-quarter operating income of $21.2 million, compared with a $3.5 million loss in the same period in 2008.
 
Third-quarter 2009 results reflect a $17.8 million increase in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rockies-to-Mid-Continent margins; a $4.5 million increase in storage and marketing margins; a $1.7 million increase in premium service margins resulting from additions to our customer base; and a $1.4 million increase in retail marketing margins.

Nine-month 2009 operating income was $95.6 million, compared with $66.4 million for the same period last year.
 
Operating income for the 2009 nine-month period benefited from a $32.0 million increase in premium service margins due to additions to customer base; and a $27.9 million increase in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rockies-to-Mid-Continent margins.  These increases were partially offset by a $38.1 million decrease in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to lower realized seasonal storage differentials.
 
At Sept. 30, 2009, total natural gas in storage was 79.6 Bcf, compared with 74.7 Bcf a year earlier.  At Oct. 30, 2009, total natural gas in storage was approximately 77.4 Bcf.  Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 82.8 Bcf in the third quarter 2009, compared with 91 Bcf in the same period in 2008.
 
2009 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
ONEOK increased its 2009 earnings per share guidance to the range of $2.65 to $2.85 per diluted share from its previous range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share.  Exhibit A includes updated information on the 2009 earnings guidance.
 
The updated earnings guidance reflects an anticipated operating income increase in the distribution and energy services segments.  Distribution segment operating income guidance includes the $17.3 million capital investment recovery mechanism in Oklahoma, partially offset by higher employee-related costs, primarily employee incentive accruals.  Energy services operating income guidance reflects higher premium service margins and increased optimization opportunities.
