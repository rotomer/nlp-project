Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 22, 2010  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today reported 2009 earnings of $2.87 per diluted share, compared with $2.95 per diluted share in 2008.  Net income attributable to ONEOK was $305.5 million, compared with $311.9 million in 2008.
 
Fourth-quarter 2009 net income attributable to ONEOK was $93.4 million, or 87 cents per diluted share, compared with $68.2 million, or 65 cents per diluted share, in the same period in 2008.
 
We delivered strong financial results in a challenging industry and economic environment, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK president and chief executive officer.
 
 Substantially higher natural gas liquids throughput and increased natural gas volumes processed in the ONEOK Partners segment helped reduce the impact of lower commodity prices and narrower natural gas liquids product price differentials, compared with 2008, Gibson said.
 
Our energy services segment turned in a strong performance as it continued to focus on providing premium services to our customers and reducing earnings volatility, Gibson added.  Our distribution segment delivered solid results with the continued implementation of innovative rate strategies that have essentially closed the performance gap between actual and allowed returns.
 
Our recently completed $2 billion-plus capital investment program in our ONEOK Partners segment also contributed to our positive results and will provide a full year of earnings in 2010, Gibson said. The partnership has identified additional potential investments, which, depending on market needs and producer commitments, could average approximately $300 million to $500 million annually between 2010 and 2015  creating additional value for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
 
ONEOKs operating income in the fourth quarter 2009 was $273.1 million, compared with $218.7 million in the fourth quarter 2008.

Fourth-quarter 2009 results improved due to increased storage and marketing margins in the energy services segment; substantially higher natural gas liquids (NGL) throughput primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in the ONEOK Partners segment; partially offset by lower premium-services margins in the energy services segment.  Additionally, the distribution segment benefited from the recovery of additional revenues from capital-recovery mechanisms, primarily in Oklahoma.
 
ONEOKs fourth-quarter 2009 operating costs were $235.5 million, compared with $191.6 million for the fourth quarter 2008.  The increases were primarily due to increased employee-related costs in the distribution segment; higher employee-related and other incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline, the Arbuckle Pipeline and the expanded Bushton fractionator; and increased outside services expenses and incremental general taxes associated with the completed capital projects in the ONEOK Partners segment.
 
2009 operating income was $894.6 million, compared with $917.0 million in 2008.
 
2009 results decreased due primarily to lower realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials in the ONEOK Partners segment.  The decreases were offset partially by substantially higher NGL volumes gathered, fractionated, transported and marketed, associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline; increased natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension and an increase in volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas Transmission in the ONEOK Partners segment; increased transportation and premium-service margins in the energy services segment; and the recovery of additional revenues from capital-recovery mechanisms in the distribution segment.
 
ONEOKs 2009 operating costs were $837.1 million, compared with $776.9 million in the same period last year.  These increases were due primarily to higher employee-related costs and incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline, the Arbuckle Pipeline and the expanded Bushton fractionator; increased outside services expenses and incremental general taxes associated with the completed capital projects in the ONEOK Partners segment; and increased employee-related costs in the distribution segment.  These increases were partially offset by lower bad-debt expense in the distribution segment.

2009 BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS
 
ONEOK Partners
 
The ONEOK Partners segment posted fourth-quarter 2009 operating income of $152.3 million, compared with $133.0 million in the same quarter 2008.
 
Fourth-quarter 2009 results increased $30.9 million, compared with 2008, due to substantially higher natural gas liquids (NGL) throughput in the natural gas liquids business, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections; a $15.5 million increase in natural gas transportation margins, as a result of the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension and increased contracted volumes on Midwestern Gas Transmission as a result of a new interconnection with the Rockies Express Pipeline in the natural gas pipelines business; a $6.5 million gain, after expenses, from selling the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy claims in the natural gas gathering and processing business; and a $4.1 million increase as a result of higher natural gas volumes processed and sold in the natural gas gathering and processing business.  These increases were partially offset by $10.8 million due to lower realized commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
2009 operating income was $546.6 million, compared with $644.8 million in 2008.
 
2009 results decreased from 2008 primarily as the result of $106.0 million in lower realized commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business; $41.7 million in

rower NGL product price differentials in the natural gas liquids business; and $4.3 million due to a prior-year operational measurement gain in the natural gas liquids business.

These decreases were offset partially by a $68.7 million increase from substantially higher NGL throughput in the natural gas liquids business, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections; a $38.8 million increase in natural gas transportation margins, as a result of the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension and an increase in contracted volumes on Midwestern Gas Transmission as the result of a new interconnection with the Rockies Express Pipeline in the natural gas pipelines business; and $22.3 million in higher volumes processed and sold in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
Operating costs were $116.2 million in the fourth quarter 2009, compared with $99.1 million in the same period last year.  2009 operating costs were $411.3 million, compared with $371.8 million in 2008.  The increases for both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 periods were due primarily to higher employee-related costs and incremental costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and the Arbuckle Pipeline, higher operating expenses at fractionation facilities, including the expanded Bushton fractionator, and incremental general taxes.
 
Equity earnings from investments for the fourth quarter 2009 were $17.3 million, compared with $26.6 million in the same period last year.  In 2009, equity earnings from investments were $72.7 million, compared with $101.4 million in 2008.
 
Equity earnings from investments decreased in both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 periods, as a result of lower subscription volumes and rates on Northern Border Pipeline, in which ONEOK Partners has a 50 percent interest.  2008 results included an $8.3 million gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline.   Additionally, equity earnings from investments decreased due to lower volumes gathered at various natural gas gathering and processing investments in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.
 
2009 capital expenditures were $615.7 million, compared with $1.25 billion in 2008.  Capital expenditures decreased significantly in 2009, primarily as a result of the completion of more than $2 billion in internal growth projects that were first announced in 2006.
 
Distribution
 
The distribution segment reported operating income of $79.5 million in the fourth quarter 2009, compared with $71.2 million in the fourth quarter 2008.

2009 margins increased $26.3 million from additional revenues from capital-recovery mechanisms; $6.3 million from revenue-recovery riders for safety-related capital investments; and $1.9 million from the implementation of rate mechanisms in Texas.  These increases were offset partially by $1.7 million in lower sales volumes due to warmer weather across the segments entire service territory.
 
Operating costs were $384.1 million in 2009, compared with $375.3 million in 2008.

2009 capital expenditures were $157.5 million, compared with $169.0 million in 2008.  Capital expenditures decreased primarily as a result of reduced spending on growth projects during 2009.
 
Energy Services

Fourth-quarter 2009 results reflect a $45.9 million increase in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher seasonal storage differentials and marketing margins; and a $13.4 million increase in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rocky Mountain-to-Mid-Continent margins.  These increases were offset partially by an $18.1 million decrease in premium-services margins.
 
2009 operating income was $135.3 million, compared with $75.7 million in 2008.
 
2009 results reflect a $41.3 million increase in transportation margins, net of hedging activities, due primarily to higher realized Rocky Mountain-to-Mid-Continent margins; a $13.9 million increase in premium-services margins due to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2009; a $7.8 million increase in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities; and a $3.2 million increase in retail marketing margins.

ONEOK has disclosed in this news release a stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, amount that is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We use stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, as a measure of our financial performance.  We define stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests adjusted for, equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes net of taxes receivable, and certain other items.
 
We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of our fundamental business activities.   ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
