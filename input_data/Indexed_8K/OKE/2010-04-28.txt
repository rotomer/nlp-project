ONEOK Announces Higher First-quarter 2010 Earnings;
TULSA, Okla.  April 28, 2010  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced higher first-quarter 2010 earnings of $1.44 per diluted share, compared with $1.16 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Net income attributable to ONEOK was $154.5 million in the first quarter 2010, compared with $122.3 million in the same period in 2009.
ONEOK also reaffirmed its 2010 net income guidance, announced on Jan. 19, 2010, in the range of $300 million to $335 million.
Our first-quarter 2010 financial results confirm that our energy services and distribution segments are benefiting from the execution of the strategies put in place over the last several years, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK president and chief executive officer.  Our ONEOK Partners segment delivered solid operating performance but slightly lower earnings due to less natural gas liquids fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization.
First-quarter 2010 operating income was $337.3 million, compared with $293.0 million for the first quarter 2009.
First-quarter 2010 results benefited from higher realized seasonal storage differentials and marketing margins, net of hedging, in the energy services segment; increased revenues from various riders and higher transportation and sales volumes in the distribution segment; higher natural gas liquids (NGL) throughput primarily associated with the Arbuckle Pipeline and the lateral pipelines connected to the Overland Pass Pipeline and new NGL supply connections; and increased natural gas throughput from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension and from Midwestern Gas Transmission in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset partially by lower premium-services margins in the energy services segment and lower natural gas liquids margins due to less NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization in the ONEOK Partners segment.
First-quarter 2010 operating costs were $203.3 million, compared with $187.0 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the operation of the recently completed capital projects and higher employee-related costs in the ONEOK Partners segment; as well as the

ONEOK Partners first-quarter 2010 operating income was $120.2 million, compared with $124.8 million in the same period last year.
First-quarter 2010 results reflect a $20.0 million increase in NGL throughput, primarily associated with the Arbuckle Pipeline and the lateral pipelines connected to the Overland Pass Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in the natural gas liquids business; and a $9.2 million increase as a result of higher natural gas throughput from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension and from Midwestern Gas Transmission in the natural gas pipelines business.
These increases were offset by a $14.8 million decrease as a result of lower margins due to less NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization; a $6.8 million decrease due to the impact of operational measurement adjustments, compared with the same period last year, in the natural gas liquids business; a $4.8 million net margin decrease due to lower gathered volumes, primarily in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and a favorable contract settlement recognized in the first quarter of 2009  in the natural gas gathering and processing business; and a $4.0 million increase in depreciation expense.
First-quarter 2010 operating costs were $96.2 million, compared with $89.5 million in the first quarter 2009.  Operating costs increased due to the operation of the recently completed capital projects and higher employee-related costs.
Equity earnings from investments for the first quarter 2010 were relatively unchanged, compared with the same period a year earlier.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter 2010 were $35.8 million, compared with $192.5 million in the same period a year earlier, due to the completion of capital projects.
Distribution
As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter 2010, the retail marketing operations in the energy services segment were moved to the distribution segment.  Prior reporting periods for both segments have been recast to reflect the realignment.
The distribution segment reported operating income of $113.7 million in the first quarter 2010, compared with $115.9 million in the first quarter 2009.
First-quarter 2010 results reflect a $3.1 million increase in revenue from various riders; a $2.7 million increase in transportation margins; and a $2.4 million increase due to higher sales volumes.

Operating costs were $99.8 million, compared with $91.4 million in the first quarter 2009.  The operating cost increase included $3.1 million related to the recognition of previously deferred integrity management program costs in Oklahoma that have been approved for recovery in its revenues; and $2.9 million in higher employee-related costs.
Residential natural gas volumes sold by the segments regulated operations were higher in the first quarter 2010, compared with the same period last year, due to colder temperatures in its service territory; however, the impact on earnings was moderated by weather-normalization mechanisms.
Energy Services
As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter 2010, the retail marketing operations in the energy services segment were moved to the distribution segment.  Prior reporting periods for both segments have been recast to reflect the realignment.
Energy Services reported first-quarter 2010 operating income of $103.0 million, compared with $51.9 million in the same period in 2009.
First-quarter 2010 results reflect a $71.6 million increase due primarily to higher realized seasonal storage differentials and marketing margins, net of hedging; and a $4.8 million increase in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to wider realized Rockies-to-Mid-Continent location differentials.
These increases were offset partially by a $22.6 million decrease in premium-services margins, primarily associated with lower demand fees and managing increased demand to meet customer-peaking requirements due to colder weather in the first quarter this year, compared with the same quarter last year; and a $1.4 million decrease in financial trading margins.
At March 31, 2010, total natural gas in storage was 25.0 Bcf, compared with 45.5 Bcf a year earlier.  Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 82.8 Bcf in the first quarter 2010, compared with 91.0 Bcf in the same period 2009.  At April 28, 2010, total natural gas in storage is approximately 34 Bcf and capacity under lease is 74.6 Bcf.  Storage capacity is expected to be 71 Bcf by the end of this year and 65 Bcf by the end of 2011.
At April 28, 2010, total long-term natural gas transportation capacity under lease is 1.4 Bcf per day.  Long-term transportation capacity is expected to be 1.3 Bcf per day by the end of this year and 1.0 Bcf per day by the end of 2012.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release a stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, amount that is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-

alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes net of the change in taxes receivable and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.   ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
