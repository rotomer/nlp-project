Board Authorizes Purchase of up to
$750 million of Companys Common Stock
 
 TULSA, Okla.  Oct. 21, 2010  The board of directors of ONEOK, Inc.

The purchases will be funded by the companys available cash, free cash flow and short-term borrowings.
   
 
 Our strong cash position, solid financial performance and continued growth through our ownership in ONEOK Partners provide us with the financial flexibility to deliver additional value to our shareholders in the form of repurchasing ONEOK shares, said John W.

 If the company repurchases shares, the purchases will be made periodically in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions at the companys discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors.
   
 
 The program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $750 million of common stock or on Dec. 31, 2013, whichever occurs first.
   
 
 Previously, the board had authorized a 7.5 million share repurchase program in May 2007, which was completed in June 2007.
