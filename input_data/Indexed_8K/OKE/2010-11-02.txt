Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 2, 2010  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced third-quarter 2010 earnings of 51 cents per diluted share, compared with 45 cents for the same period last year.  Net income attributable to ONEOK was $55.3 million in the third quarter 2010, compared with $48.0 million for the same period in 2009.
Net income attributable to ONEOK for the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2010, was $251.6 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, compared with $212.0 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
All of our businesses are performing well, with our ONEOK Partners segment benefiting from continued volume growth as the result of the $2 billion-plus capital investment program that was completed last year, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK president and chief executive officer.
Our distribution segment is benefiting from the new rate design that was implemented in Oklahoma earlier this year.  As anticipated, our energy services segment posted lower quarterly results in a challenging environment and continues to align its contracted natural gas transportation and storage capacity with the needs of its premium-services customers to reduce annual earnings volatility, he said.
Third-quarter 2010 operating income was $186.9 million, compared with $173.8 million for the third-quarter 2009, as a result of higher net margin in the distribution segment due primarily to new rates in Oklahoma that increase fixed fees, resulting in less volumetric sensitivity and increased revenue in the warmer months; and a gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in the ONEOK Partners segment.
 
These third-quarter 2010 increases were offset partially by lower natural gas liquids (NGL) optimization margins due to narrower NGL product price differentials between the NGL market centers in Conway, Kan., and Mont Belvieu, Texas, and limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities in the ONEOK Partners segment; and lower realized seasonal natural gas storage differentials, net of hedging, and lower marketing margins in the energy services segment.

 Third-quarter 2010 operating costs were $203.4 million, compared with $204.6 million in the same period last year, due primarily to lower property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009 and lower costs for outside services in the ONEOK Partners segment; offset partially by the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in the distribution segment.
   
Year-to-date 2010 operating income was $702.9 million, compared with $621.6 million for the same period last year.
The increase in year-to-date 2010 results was driven primarily by higher realized seasonal natural gas storage differentials, net of hedging, and higher marketing margins in the energy services segment; higher NGL throughput in the ONEOK Partners segment, primarily from the completion of capital projects in late 2009, and new NGL supply connections; higher net margin in the distribution segment due primarily to new rates in Oklahoma; the gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in the ONEOK Partners segment; higher contracted natural gas transportation capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission, Viking Gas Transmission and Guardian Pipelines in the ONEOK Partners segment; and higher natural gas and natural gas liquids storage margins, primarily as a result of contract renegotiations in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These year-to-date 2010 increases were offset partially by lower natural gas liquids optimization margins due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities and narrower NGL product price differentials between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers in the ONEOK Partners segment; lower premium-services margins, primarily associated with lower demand fees and managing increased demand to meet customer-peaking requirements due to colder weather in the first quarter 2010, compared with the same period last year, in the energy services segment; and lower natural gas volumes gathered in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Operating costs for the nine-month 2010 period were $610.3 million, compared with $601.7 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in the distribution segment; higher employee-related costs and higher property insurance costs in the ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by lower property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009 and lower costs for outside services in the ONEOK Partners segment.

BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS:
ONEOK Partners
ONEOK Partners third-quarter 2010 operating income was $160.5 million, compared with $144.7 million in the same period last year.
Third-quarter 2010 results reflect a $16.3 million gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company; and a $3.8 million increase due to higher

NGL throughput, primarily from the completion of capital projects in 2009, as well as new NGL supply connections in the natural gas liquids business.
These increases were offset by a $9.9 million decrease in optimization margins in the natural gas liquids business due to narrower NGL product price differentials between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers and limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities.
Additional NGL fractionation capacity, which benefits optimization activities, became available on Sept. 1, 2010, when a contract at the partnerships Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionator expired.  Additional capacity also will become available when a 60,000 bpd fractionation services agreement with Targa Resources Partners begins in the second quarter 2011.  The expansion of the Sterling I NGL distribution pipeline, expected to be completed in the second half of 2011,will enable the transportation of additional NGL purity products to the Gulf Coast market.
 
Third-quarter 2010 operating costs were $97.8 million, compared with $105.1 million in the third quarter 2009.  The decrease was due primarily to lower property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009 and lower costs for outside services.
Operating income for the nine-month 2010 period was $426.6 million, compared with $394.4 million in the same period a year earlier.
Nine-month 2010 results reflect a $49.2 million increase due to increased NGL throughput, primarily from the completion of its capital projects, as well as new NGL supply connections and a $16.3 million gain on the sale of a 49 percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in its natural gas liquids business; an $11.3 million increase as a result of higher contracted natural gas transportation capacity on Midwestern Gas Transmission, Viking Gas Transmission and Guardian Pipelines in its natural gas pipelines business; a $10.8 million increase from higher storage margins, primarily as a result of contract renegotiations in its natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids businesses; and a $5.6 million increase from the impact of higher natural gas prices on retained fuel in its natural gas pipelines business.
These nine-month 2010 increases were offset partially by a $39.5 million decrease in optimization margins due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities and narrower NGL product price differentials between the Conway and Mont Belvieu NGL market centers in its natural gas liquids business, compared with the same period last year; and a $5.3 million decrease from lower natural gas volumes gathered, primarily in the Powder River Basin, in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
Nine-month 2010 operating costs were $292.1 million, compared with $295.1 million in the same period a year earlier, due primarily to lower property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009 and lower costs for outside services, offset partially by higher property insurance costs and higher employee-related costs.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $43.8 million in the third quarter 2010, compared with $41.9 million in the same period in 2009.  For the nine-month 2010 period, depreciation and amortization expense was $131.7 million, compared with $121.8 million in the same period in 2009.  The increases were primarily associated with the partnerships completed capital projects in 2009.
 
Equity earnings from investments were $29.4 million in the third quarter 2010, compared with $20.1 million in the same period in 2009.  Nine-month 2010 equity earnings from investments were $71.2 million, compared with $55.5 million in the same period last year.  The increases were due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, of which ONEOK Partners owns 50 percent.
Allowance for equity funds used during construction for the third quarter 2010 was $0.3 million, compared with $7.3 million in the same period last year.  Allowance for equity funds used during construction for the nine-month 2010 period was $0.7 million, compared with $25.8 million in the same period last year.  These decreases were due primarily to the completion of capital projects last year in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $19.6 million in the third quarter 2010, compared with $9.1 million in the third quarter 2009.
Third-quarter 2010 results reflect an $18.0 million increase from new rates in Oklahoma that increase fixed fees, resulting in less volumetric sensitivity and increased revenue in the warmer months; and a $1.0 million increase in transportation revenues.
Natural gas volumes sold by the segments regulated operations were lower in the third quarter 2010, compared with the same period last year, due to reduced sales to lower margin wholesale customers in Kansas.
Operating costs in the third quarter 2010 were $98.4 million, compared with $92.5 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in Oklahoma that are recovered in revenues and increased costs for outside services.
Operating income for the nine-month 2010 period was $165.7 million, compared with $140.0 million in the same period in 2009.
Nine-month 2010 results improved due primarily to a $35.6 million increase from new rates in Oklahoma; a $4.6 million increase in rider and surcharge recoveries in Kansas and Oklahoma; a $2.9 million increase due to higher natural gas sales, primarily in the first quarter of this year; a $2.6 million increase from capital-recovery mechanisms in Kansas; and a $2.6 million increase in transportation margins.  These increases were offset partially by a $5.9

million decrease in retail marketing margins associated primarily with reduced customer risk-management services.
Residential volumes increased for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2010, compared with the same period last year, due to colder temperatures across the segments entire service territory in the first quarter 2010.
Operating costs were $296.4 million for the nine months of 2010, compared with $285.1 million for the same period last year.  The operating cost increase includes the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in Oklahoma and increased costs for outside services, offset partially by lower employee-related costs.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported third-quarter 2010 operating income of $6.9 million, compared with $19.7 million in the same period in 2009.
Third-quarter results reflect an $8.7 million decrease due to lower realized seasonal natural gas storage differentials, net of hedging, and lower marketing margins, offset partially by a decrease in storage expense due to lower contracted storage capacity; a $3.2 million decrease in premium-services margins, primarily associated with lower demand fees; and a $3.1 million decrease in natural gas transportation margins, net of hedging.  These decreases were offset partially by a $2.4 million increase in financial trading margins.
Third-quarter 2010 operating costs were $7.0 million, compared with $6.8 million in the same period last year.
Operating income for the nine-month 2010 period was $110.9 million, compared with operating income of $85.9 million in the same period in 2009, reflecting a $57.0 million increase due primarily to higher realized seasonal storage differentials, net of hedging, and higher marketing margins and a $2.2 million increase in financial trading margins.
These increases were offset partially by a $28.5 million decrease in premium-services margins, associated primarily with lower demand fees and managing increased demand to meet customer-peaking requirements due to colder weather in the first quarter 2010, compared with the same period last year; and a $6.4 million decrease in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast location differentials.
Operating costs for the nine-month 2010 period were $21.0 million, compared with $21.8 million in the same period last year.
 
At Sept. 30, 2010, total natural gas in storage was 65.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf), compared with 79.4 Bcf a year earlier.  Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 76.6 Bcf at the end of the third quarter 2010, compared with 82.8 Bcf in the same period in 2009.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE:

ONEOK Reports Higher Third-quarter 2010 Earnings

Page 8
 
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release a stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, amount that is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes net of the change in taxes receivable and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
