ONEOK Announces Solid Fourth-quarter and
TULSA, Okla.  Feb. 21, 2011  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced fourth-quarter 2010 earnings of 76 cents per diluted share, compared with 87 cents for the same period last year.   Net income attributable to ONEOK was $83.1 million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with $93.4 million for the same period in 2009.
Full-year 2010 net income attributable to ONEOK was $334.6 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, compared with $305.5 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, for 2009.  2010 results include a $16.3 million, or 4 cents per share, gain on the sale of a 49-percent ONEOK Partners interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, LLC to Williams Partners L.P. that was completed in September 2010.
 
"All of our businesses performed well in 2010.  Our ONEOK Partners segment achieved higher results for both the quarter and the year as the result of the natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth associated with the first full-year of operation of the $2 billion growth projects we completed in 2009," said John W. Gibson, ONEOK vice chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"Our distribution segment is benefiting from the new rate design that was implemented in Oklahoma in early 2010, Gibson continued.  Our energy services segment performed as expected and continues to focus on realigning its contracted natural gas transportation and storage capacity with the needs of its premium-services customers.
 
ONEOKs fourth-quarter 2010 operating income was $241.1 million, compared with $273.1 million for the fourth-quarter 2009.
 
Fourth-quarter financial 2010 results decreased, compared with the same period last year, as a result of lower natural gas storage, marketing and transportation margins, net of hedging, in the energy services segment; expiration of the 2009 capital-recovery mechanism in Oklahoma in the distribution segment now included in base rates; and the ONEOK Partners segment selling its bankruptcy claims with Lehman Brothers in the same period in 2009.

These fourth-quarter 2010 decreases were offset partially by higher premium-services margins in the energy services segment, which were lower for the full year; higher natural gas liquids (NGL) optimization margins and favorable NGL price differentials, which were lower for the full year, higher storage margins and NGL volumes in the natural gas liquids business; new performance-based rates in Oklahoma in the distribution segment; and increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin in the natural gas gathering and processing business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
 
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating costs were $229.5 million, compared with $235.5 million in the same period in 2009, due primarily to lower than estimated property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009 in the ONEOK Partners segment.  These decreases were offset partially by higher property insurance and employee-related costs in the ONEOK Partners segment; and the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in Oklahoma in the distribution segment.
 
2010 operating income was $944.0 million, compared with $894.6 million for 2009.
 
2010 financial results increased due to higher NGL volumes, primarily from the completion of capital projects in 2009, new NGL supply connections and the gain on the sale of a 49-percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline in the ONEOK Partners segment; higher net margin in the distribution segment from new rates in Oklahoma that increased fixed fees and reduced volumetric sensitivity; and higher storage and marketing margins due to higher realized seasonal natural gas storage price differentials, net of hedging, in the energy services segment.
 
These 2010 increases were offset partially by lower NGL optimization margins due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid-Continent and Gulf-Coast markets until September 2010 and less favorable NGL price differentials in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment; lower transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast price differentials, and lower premium-services margins, primarily associated with lower demand fees, in the energy services segment; and the expiration of the 2009 capital-recovery mechanism in Oklahoma in the distribution segment.

BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS:
ONEOK Partners
ONEOK Partners fourth-quarter 2010 operating income was $159.7 million, compared with $152.3 million in the same period last year.
 
The increases in operating income for the fourth quarter 2010 reflect a $4.9 million increase from higher NGL optimization margins due to increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid-Continent and Gulf-Coast markets and favorable NGL price differentials, a $3.5 million increase in NGL storage margins and a $2.2 million increase in NGL volumes, primarily from the completion of capital projects in 2009 and new supply connections, in the natural gas liquids business; and a $3.6 million increase due to higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin, due primarily to the increased drilling activity in the Bakken Shale in the partnerships natural gas gathering and processing business.

These fourth-quarter 2010 increases were offset partially by a $6.5 million decrease due to selling the partnerships bankruptcy claims with Lehman Brothers in the same period in 2009, a $2.7 million decrease from lower net realized commodity prices and a $2.4 million decrease due to lower natural gas volumes processed and sold in western Oklahoma and Kansas, driven partially by natural production declines  all in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
Additional NGL fractionation capacity, which benefits optimization activities, became available on Sept. 1, 2010, when a contract at the partnerships Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionator expired.  Additional capacity also will become available when a 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) fractionation services agreement with Targa Resources Partners begins in the second quarter 2011.  The expansion of the Sterling I NGL distribution pipeline, expected to be completed in the second half of 2011,will enable the transportation of additional NGL purity products to the Gulf Coast market.
 
 
For 2010, operating income was $586.3 million, compared with $546.6 million in 2009.
 
2010 financial results reflect an increase of $51.4 million as a result of higher NGL volumes, primarily from the completion of capital projects in 2009 and new supply connections, and a $16.3 million gain on the sale of a 49-percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company in the natural gas liquids business; a $14.4 million increase due to higher natural gas and NGL storage margins, primarily as a result of contract renegotiations in the natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids businesses; a $9.1 million increase from higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the Williston Basin, due primarily to the increased drilling activity in the Bakken Shale in the natural gas gathering and processing business; and an $8.7 million increase from increased contracted natural gas transportation capacity on the Midwestern Gas Transmission and Viking Gas Transmission pipelines in the natural gas pipelines business.
 
These increases were offset partially by a $34.7 million decrease from lower NGL optimization margins in the natural gas liquids business due to limited NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid-Continent and Gulf-Coast markets until September 2010 and less favorable NGL price differentials; a $7.8 million decrease from lower natural gas volumes processed and sold in western Oklahoma and Kansas, a $6.5 million decrease from selling the partnerships bankruptcy claims with Lehman Brothers in 2009, and a $6.3 million decrease as a result of lower natural gas volumes gathered in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming as a result of reduced drilling activity  all in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating costs were $111.4 million, compared with $116.2 million in the fourth quarter 2009.  2010 operating costs were $403.5 million, compared with $411.2 million in the same period a year earlier.   Fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 operating cost decreases were due primarily to lower than estimated property taxes associated with the capital projects completed in 2009.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $42.0 million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with $42.4 million in the same period in 2009.  For 2010, depreciation and amortization expense was $173.7 million, compared with $164.1 million in 2009, due primarily to the completion of capital projects last year.
 
  Equity earnings from investments were $30.7 million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with $17.3 million in the same period in 2009.  2010 equity earnings from investments were $101.9 million, compared with $72.7 million in 2009.  The fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 increases were due primarily to increased contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, of which ONEOK Partners owns 50 percent.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline is now included in equity earnings from investments, effective September 2010.
Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $60.8 million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with $81.6 million in the fourth quarter 2009.
 
Fourth-quarter 2010 margins decreased $17.4 million as a result of the expiration of the 2009 capital-recovery mechanism in Oklahoma recognized in the same period last year.  This decrease was offset partially by a $4.4 million increase due to new rates in Oklahoma and a $1.8 million increase in rider and surcharge recoveries in Kansas and Oklahoma.
 
Natural gas volumes sold by the distribution segments regulated operations were lower in the fourth quarter 2010, due to warmer weather in the period, compared with the same period in 2009.  This decrease was moderated by weather-normalization mechanisms.
 
Operating income for 2010 was $226.4 million, compared with $221.6 million in 2009.
 
2010 results improved due primarily to a $40.1 million increase from new rates in Oklahoma; a $6.5 million increase in rider and surcharge recoveries in Oklahoma and Kansas; a $3.7 million increase due to higher natural gas sales, primarily in the first quarter of 2010; a $3.4 million increase from capital-recovery mechanisms in Kansas; and a $2.7 million increase in transportation margins.  These increases were offset partially by a $17.4 million decrease from the expiration of the 2009 capital-recovery mechanism recognized last year in Oklahoma; and a $7.6 million decrease in retail marketing margins.
 
Operating costs in the fourth quarter 2010 were $111.4 million, compared with $105.2 million in the same period last year.  Operating costs were $407.8 million for 2010, compared with $390.3 million for 2009.  Fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 increases were due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred integrity-management program costs in Oklahoma.
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense was $34.1 million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with $30.4 million in the same period in 2009.  For 2010, depreciation and amortization expense was $131.1 million, compared with $122.7 million in 2009.  These

increases were due primarily to increased regulatory amortization associated with revenue rider recoveries.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported fourth-quarter 2010 operating income of $19.8 million, compared with $37.7 million in the same period in 2009.
Fourth-quarter results reflect a $17.2 million decrease in storage and marketing margins due to a reduction in storage withdrawals from lower contracted natural gas storage capacity, offset partially by higher realized seasonal natural gas storage price differentials, net of hedging, and a decrease in storage expense due to lower contracted natural gas storage capacity; and a $15.0 million decrease in natural gas transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast price differentials.  These decreases were offset partially by a $7.3 million increase in premium-services margins, associated primarily with managing demand of customer-peaking requirements as a result of warmer weather in the fourth quarter 2010, compared with the same period last year.
 
Operating income for 2010 was $130.7 million, compared with $123.6 million in the same period in 2009.  Results include a $39.7 million increase due primarily to higher realized seasonal storage price differentials, net of hedging, and higher marketing margins and a $3.1 million increase in financial trading margins.
 
These increases were offset by a $21.4 million decrease in transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast price differentials; and a $21.3 million decrease in premium-services margins, associated primarily with lower demand fees as a result of lower natural gas price volatility, compared with the same period last year.
 
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating costs were $7.4 million, compared with $13.7 million in the same period last year.  Operating costs for the full-year 2010 period were $28.4 million, compared with $35.5 million in 2009.  Fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 decreases were due primarily to lower legal-related costs and lower property taxes.
 
At Dec. 31, 2010, total natural gas in storage was 63.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf), compared with 60.5 Bcf a year earlier.  Total natural gas storage capacity under lease was 73.6 Bcf at the end of the fourth quarter 2010, compared with 82.8 Bcf in the same period in 2009.  At Feb.18, 2011, total natural gas in storage was approximately 27.1 Bcf, and natural gas storage capacity under lease was 73.6 Bcf.
 
At Dec. 31, 2010, total natural gas transportation capacity was 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), of which 1.1 Bcf/d was contracted under long-term natural gas transportation contracts, compared with 1.7 Bcf/d of total capacity and 1.4 Bcf/d of long-term capacity at the end of 2009.   At Feb. 18, 2011, total long-term natural gas transportation capacity under lease was 1.1 Bcf/d.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net of the change in taxes receivable, and certain other items.
 
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
