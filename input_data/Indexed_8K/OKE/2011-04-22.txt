ONEOK Partners Increases Quarterly Distribution
 
   
TULSA, Okla.  April 20, 2011  The board of directors of the general partner of ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS) today increased the partnerships quarterly cash distribution to $1.15 per unit from $1.14 per unit, effective for the first quarter 2011, resulting in an annualized cash distribution of $4.60 per unit. The distribution is payable May 13, 2011, to unitholders of record as of April 29, 2011.
 
 This latest distribution increase reflects our continuing commitment to deliver value to our unitholders, said John W. Gibson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK Partners. The completion of our $2-billion capital-investment program in 2009 and our plan to invest another $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion for additional growth projects between now and 2014 provide us with the opportunity to continue to increase distributions to unitholders.
   
 
 In October 2010, ONEOK Partners indicated that it expects to increase its distribution by 1 cent per quarter in 2011 and between 5 percent to 10 percent annually in 2012 and 2013, subject to approval by the board of directors of the general partner.
   
 
 ONEOK Partners has increased its distribution by approximately 44 percent since April 2006, when a wholly owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) became the sole general partner.

(NYSE: OKS) is one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships, and is a leader in the gathering, processing, storage and transportation of natural gas in the U.S. and owns one of the nations premier natural gas liquids (NGL) systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers.
