Exhibit 99.1
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  May 3, 2011  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced first-quarter 2011 earnings of $1.19 per diluted share, compared with $1.44 per diluted share for the same period last year.   Net income attributable to ONEOK was $130.1 million in the first quarter 2011, compared with $154.5 million for the same period in 2010.
ONEOK also reaffirmed its 2011 net income guidance, announced on Jan. 18, 2011, in the range of $325 million to $360 million.
Our business segments performed well in the first quarter, with ONEOK Partners turning in exceptional results, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK vice chairman, president and chief executive officer.  Our distribution segment delivered a solid quarter, and our energy services segment, as expected, continued to perform well in a challenging market.
 
ONEOKs first-quarter 2011 operating income was $330.0 million, compared with $337.3 million for the first-quarter 2010.
 
First-quarter financial 2011 results reflect favorable natural gas liquids (NGL) price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset by lower margins in the energy services segment due primarily to lower realized seasonal natural gas storage price differentials and narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast price differentials.  Results in the distribution segment were lower due to higher operating costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense.
 
In addition, first-quarter 2011 operating costs were $223.6 million, compared with $203.3 million in the same period in 2010, due primarily to higher share-based compensation costs, as well as increased employee benefits costs and higher property taxes.

BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS:
ONEOK Partners
ONEOK Partners first-quarter 2011 operating income was $177.6 million, compared with $120.2 million in the same period last year.
The increase in first-quarter 2011 operating income reflects a $56.4 million increase due to higher NGL optimization margins as a result of favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid-Continent and Gulf-Coast markets due in part to the expiration of a fractionation-only contract at the Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionator in September 2010 and an $8.9 million increase from higher NGL gathering volumes and contract renegotiations associated with exchange services activities in the natural gas liquids business; and a $7.9 million increase from higher net realized commodity prices and a $4.1 million increase from changes in contract terms in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
These increases were offset partially by an $11.9 million decrease due to the September 2010 deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in the natural gas liquids business.
First-quarter 2011 operating costs were $108.7 million, compared with $96.3 million in the first quarter 2010.  This increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and benefit plans administered by ONEOK and higher property taxes.  These increases were offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline, which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business.
 Equity earnings from investments were $32.1 million in the first quarter 2011, compared with $21.1 million in the same period in 2010.  This increase was due primarily to higher contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, in which the partnership owns 50 percent.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline is now included in equity earnings from investments, effective September 2010.
Capital expenditures increased to $144.8 million, compared with $35.8 million in the first quarter 2010, due to construction costs related to the announced partnership growth projects.

Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $104.8 million in the first quarter 2011, compared with $113.7 million in the first quarter 2010.
First-quarter 2011 results reflect higher operating costs due primarily to $4.6 million in higher share-based compensation costs and $1.2 million from increased pension costs.
Net margin was relatively unchanged from the same period last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $36.0 million for the first quarter 2011, compared with $33.3 million for the same period in 2010.  This increase was due primarily to increased regulatory amortization expense associated with previously deferred costs that have been approved for recovery in its revenues and higher depreciation expense associated with the investment in automated meter-reading devices in Oklahoma during 2010.
Residential and commercial volumes decreased due to warmer temperatures compared with the same period last year; however, the impact on net margin was moderated by weather-normalization mechanisms.

Energy Services
The energy services segment reported first-quarter 2011 operating income of $47.8 million, compared with $103.0 million in the same period in 2010.
First-quarter results reflect a $31.6 million decrease in storage and marketing margins due primarily to lower realized seasonal natural gas storage price differentials, net of hedging; a $14.9 million decrease in natural gas transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized Mid-Continent-to-Gulf-Coast price differentials; a $6.8 million decrease in premium-services margins associated with lower demand fees; and a $1.4 million decrease in financial trading margins compared with the same period last year.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net of the change in taxes receivable, and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
