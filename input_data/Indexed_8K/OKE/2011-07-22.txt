Exhibit 99.1
 
ONEOK Partners Increases Quarterly Distribution
Increase is 1 cent on a post-split basis, or 2 cents on a pre-split basis
 
 TULSA, Okla.  July 21, 2011  The board of directors of the general partner of ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS) today increased the partnerships quarterly cash distribution to 58.5 cents per unit from 57.5 cents per unit on a post-split basis, effective for the second quarter 2011, resulting in an annualized post-split cash distribution of $2.34 per unit. The distribution is payable Aug. 12, 2011, to unitholders of record as of Aug. 1, 2011.
   
 
 This distribution increase is twice what was originally factored into our 2011 financial guidance, based on the continued strong performance at the partnership, said John W. Gibson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK Partners. Incremental earnings from our $2-billion capital-investment program completed in 2009 provide us with the opportunity to increase distributions to unitholders. We expect that our plans to invest approximately $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion for growth projects between now and 2014 will enable us to continue to execute our strategy of delivering value to unitholders.
   
 
 ONEOK Partners completed its two-for-one split of the partnerships common units and Class B units on July 12, 2011, with the distribution of one unit for each unit outstanding and held by holders of record on June 30, 2011. As a result of the two-for-one unit split, the partnership now has 130,827,354 common units and 72,988,252 Class B units outstanding.
   
 
 In October 2010, ONEOK Partners indicated that it expected to increase its distribution by 1 cent per quarter in 2011 on a pre-split basis, or 0.5 cents per quarter on a post-split basis, and between 5 percent to 10 percent annually in 2012 and 2013, subject to approval by the board of directors of the general partner.
   
 
 ONEOK Partners has increased its distribution by approximately 46 percent since April 2006, when a wholly owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) became the sole general partner.
