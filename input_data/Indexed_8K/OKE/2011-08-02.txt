TULSA, Okla.  Aug. 2, 2011  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced second-quarter 2011 earnings of 51 cents per diluted share, compared with 39 cents per diluted share for the same period last year.  Net income attributable to ONEOK was $55.1 million in the second quarter 2011, compared with $41.7 million for the same period in 2010.
Net income attributable to ONEOK for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, was $185.3 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared with $196.3 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
ONEOK also updated its 2011 net income guidance to the range of $325 million to $345 million compared with the previous guidance of $325 million to $360 million.
We continued to build on our solid first-quarter results and performed well in the second quarter, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer.  The ONEOK Partners segment turned in an exceptional quarter, increasing operating income by almost 40 percent, with its natural gas liquids business results almost doubling from the same period last year.
 
Our distribution segment delivered a solid quarter, while our energy services segment continues to face a challenging market, Gibson said.
 
ONEOKs second-quarter 2011 operating income was $216.9 million, compared with $178.7 million for the second quarter 2010.
Second-quarter 2011 operating income benefited from higher natural gas liquids (NGL) optimization, isomerization and exchange margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities; and higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by

the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset by lower margins in the energy services segment due primarily to lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities, resulting from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials offset partially by increased storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities; and increased operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense in the distribution segment.
Year-to-date 2011 operating income was $547.0 million, compared with $516.0 million for the same period last year.
 
The increase in year-to-date 2011 results was driven primarily by higher NGL optimization, isomerization and exchange margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities; and higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset by lower margins in the energy services segment due primarily to lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities, resulting from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials and lower storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities.
Results in the distribution segment were lower as a result of higher operating costs and higher depreciation expense.
In addition, second-quarter 2011 operating costs were $225.7 million, compared with $203.6 million in the same period in 2010.  Operating costs for the six-month 2011 period were $449.3 million, compared with $406.9 million in the same period last year.  The increases for both the three- and six-month 2011 periods were due primarily to higher share-based compensation and other employee-benefit costs.
Share-based compensation costs primarily relate to the companys employee stock award program that awards eligible employees with a share of company stock whenever the stock closes at a new one-dollar high.  Through June 30, 2011, the company awarded 19 shares of company stock to each employee at a cost of $8.9 million, which includes taxes paid on behalf of employees.

BUSINESS-UNIT RESULTS:
ONEOK Partners
ONEOK Partners second-quarter 2011 operating income was $202.0 million, compared with $146.0 million in the same period last year.
The increase in second-quarter 2011 operating income, compared with the same period in 2010, reflects:
These increases were offset partially by a $16.7 million decrease due to the September 2010 deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in the natural gas liquids business.
For the first six months 2011, the ONEOK Partners segment posted operating income of $379.6 million, compared with $266.1 million in the same period a year earlier.
Six-month 2011 results reflect a $118.2 million increase due to higher NGL optimization margins as a result of favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities between the Mid-Continent and Gulf-Coast markets and a $27.2 million increase from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated,

and contract renegotiations associated with storage and exchange services activities in the natural gas liquids business; and a $15.1 million increase from higher net realized commodity prices and a $8.8 million increase due to favorable changes in contract terms in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
These increases were offset partially by a $32.3 million decrease due to the September 2010 deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in the natural gas liquids business.
Second-quarter 2011 operating costs were $113.6 million, compared with $97.9 million in the second quarter 2010.  Six-month 2010 operating costs were $222.3 million, compared with $194.3 million in the same period a year earlier.  The increases for both the three- and six-month 2011 periods are due primarily to higher employee-related costs associated with incentive and benefit plans, which includes share-based compensation costs and higher property taxes.  These increases were offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline, which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business.
Equity earnings from investments were $29.5 million in the second quarter 2011, compared with $20.7 million in the same period in 2010.  For the six-month 2011 period, equity earnings from investments were $61.6 million, compared with $41.8 million in the same period in 2010.  These increases were due primarily to higher contracted capacity on Northern Border Pipeline, in which the partnership owns 50 percent.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline is now included in equity earnings from investments, effective September 2010.

Second-quarter 2011 results reflect higher operating costs due primarily to $5.5 million in higher share-based compensation costs, $1.2 million in increased pension costs and $1.0 million in higher employee-benefit costs.
For the six months 2011, operating income was $125.7 million, compared with $146.1 million in the same period in 2010.
Six-month 2011 results decreased as a result of higher operating costs due primarily to $11.2 million in higher share-based compensation costs, $2.4 million in increased pension costs and $1.9 million in higher employee-benefit costs.
Net margin for both the three- and six-month 2011 periods were relatively unchanged compared with the same periods last year.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $34.5 million for the second quarter 2011, compared with $30.9 million for the same period in 2010.  For the six-month 2011 period, depreciation and amortization expense was $70.4 million, compared with $64.2 million in the same period of 2010.  These increases were due primarily to increased regulatory amortization expense associated with previously deferred costs that were approved for recovery in the segments revenues; and higher depreciation expense associated with the investment in automated meter-reading in Oklahoma during 2010.
Key Statistics: More detailed information is listed on page 18 of the tables.
Energy Services
The energy services segment reported a second-quarter 2011 operating loss of $5.8 million, compared with operating income of $0.9 million in the same period in 2010.
Second-quarter results reflect a $19.3 million decrease in natural gas transportation margins, net of hedging, due primarily to narrower realized natural gas price location differentials resulting from lower hedge settlements in 2011; and a $1.5 million decrease in financial trading margins compared with the same period last year.  These decreases were offset

The increase in Northern Border Pipeline equity earnings is due to wider natural gas price location differentials between the markets it serves. The increase in Overland Pass Pipeline equity earnings is due to lower interest expense as the result of financing the Overland Pass Pipeline at the partnership level versus the joint-venture level that was assumed in the initial 2011 financial guidance.
Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be approximately $1.55 billion, comprised of approximately $1.3 billion at ONEOK Partners and $258 million on a stand-alone basis.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net of the change in taxes receivable, and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
