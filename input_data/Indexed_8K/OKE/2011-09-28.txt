ONEOK Announces Higher 2012 Financial Guidance
 
2012 Net Income Expected to Increase 13 Percent
 
TULSA, Okla.  Sept. 26, 2011 - ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced that its 2012 net income is expected to increase 13 percent compared with its current 2011 earnings guidance that was updated on Aug. 2, 2011.
 
ONEOKs 2012 net income is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $400 million compared with its current 2011 guidance range of $325 million to $345 million, reflecting higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners and natural gas distribution segments, compared with 2011.
 
Our 2012 earnings guidance reflects significantly higher anticipated earnings in our ONEOK Partners segment as projects from our previously announced $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion, four-year growth program are placed into service later this year and in 2012, said John W. Gibson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK. ONEOKs continued strong cash flow is further enhanced by higher anticipated distributions from ONEOK Partners, enabling us to deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders, including increased dividends.
 
2012 earnings guidance reflects increased operating income in the ONEOK Partners segment due to higher anticipated earnings from increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes and higher natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes gathered and fractionated and higher margins from rates activity in the natural gas distribution segment. These increases are expected to be offset partially by lower NGL optimization margins resulting from lower optimization volumes and narrower NGL price differentials in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business.
 
The midpoint for ONEOKs 2012 operating income guidance is approximately $1.1 billion. Additional information is available in Exhibit A in the on the ONEOK website.

For 2012, ONEOKs capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $306 million on a stand-alone basis.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
 
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income attributable to ONEOK adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net of the change in taxes receivable, and certain other items.
 
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities. ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
