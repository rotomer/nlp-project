TULSA, Okla.  Nov. 1, 2011  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced third-quarter 2011 earnings of 57 cents per diluted share, compared with 51 cents per diluted share for the same period last year.  Third-quarter net income attributable to ONEOK was $60.3 million, compared with $55.3 million for the same period in 2010.
Nine-month period 2011 net income attributable to ONEOK was $245.6 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, compared with $251.6 million, or $2.34 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
ONEOK also increased its 2011 net income guidance to the range of $345 million to $365 million compared with the previous guidance of $325 million to $345 million, reflecting higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment.
We continued to build on our solid second-quarter results and performed well in the third quarter, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman, president and chief executive officer.  Our ONEOK Partners segment turned in exceptional third-quarter results, due primarily to strong natural gas liquids price differentials and higher volumes.
Our distribution segment delivered a solid quarter, while our energy services segment continues to face a challenging market, Gibson said.
 
ONEOKs third-quarter 2011 operating income was $248.9 million, a 33-percent increase compared with $186.9 million for the third quarter 2010.
Third-quarter 2011 operating income benefited from higher natural gas liquids (NGL) optimization, isomerization and exchange margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities; higher net realized NGL and condensate prices, higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and higher natural gas volumes processed, offset partially by the

deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Third-quarter 2011 distribution segment results were relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year.
The energy services segment had lower third-quarter results due primarily to lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities, resulting from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials.
Year-to-date 2011 operating income was $795.8 million, compared with $702.9 million for the same period last year.
 
The nine-month 2011 increase was driven primarily by higher NGL optimization, isomerization and exchange margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities; higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, higher net realized commodity prices and higher natural gas volumes processed, offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in the natural gas liquids business in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset by lower earnings in the energy services segment due primarily to lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities, resulting from narrower realized natural gas price location differentials, lower storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, and lower premium-services margins.
Nine-month 2011 distribution segment results were lower as a result of higher operating costs, primarily higher share-based compensation, and higher depreciation and amortization expense.
Operating costs for the third quarter 2011 were $209.0 million, compared with $203.4 million in the same period last year.  Operating costs for the nine-month 2011 period were $658.4 million, compared with $610.3 million in the same period last year.  The increase for the nine-month 2011 period was due to higher labor and other employee-benefit costs, including share-based compensation costs; higher property taxes; and higher expenses for materials and outside services in the ONEOK Partners segment.
Share-based compensation costs relate primarily to the companys employee stock award program that awards eligible employees with a share of company stock whenever the stock closes at a new one-dollar high.  Through Sept. 30, 2011, the company awarded 20 shares of company stock to each employee at a cost of $9.7 million, which includes taxes paid on behalf of employees.

These increases were offset partially by a $16.3 million gain from the third-quarter 2010 sale of a 49-percent ownership interest in Overland Pass Pipeline Company, and a $10.2 million decrease, compared with the same period last year, from the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline in September 2010 in the natural gas liquids business.
For the nine-month 2011 period, the ONEOK Partners segment posted operating income of $622.0 million, compared with $426.6 million in the same period a year earlier.

month 2011 periods were due primarily to higher labor and employee-related costs associated with incentive and benefit plans, which includes share-based compensation costs; higher property taxes; and higher expenses for materials and outside services associated with scheduled maintenance at the partnerships fractionator and storage facilities.  These increases were offset partially by the deconsolidation of Overland Pass Pipeline, which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business.
Equity earnings from investments were $32.0 million in the third quarter 2011, compared with $29.4 million in the same period in 2010.  For the nine-month 2011 period, equity earnings from investments were $93.7 million, compared with $71.2 million in the same period in 2010.  The increase for the nine-month 2011 period was due primarily to higher contracted capacity on the partnerships 50-percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners 50-percent interest in Overland Pass Pipeline is now included in equity earnings from investments, effective September 2010.

Distribution
The distribution segment reported operating income of $19.4 million in the third quarter 2011, compared with $19.6 million in the third quarter 2010.
For the nine months 2011, operating income was $145.0 million, compared with $165.7 million in the same period in 2010.
Nine-month 2011 results decreased as a result of higher operating costs due primarily to $9.5 million in higher share-based compensation costs and $2.4 million in increased pension costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $30.3 million for the third quarter 2011, compared with $32.8 million for the same period in 2010.  The decrease for the third quarter 2011 reflects lower regulatory amortization expense related to the expiration of the integrity- management program rider in Oklahoma, offset partially by higher depreciation expense associated with increased capital expenditures.

For the nine-month 2011 period, depreciation and amortization expense was $100.7 million, compared with $97.0 million in the same period of 2010.  The increase for the nine-month 2011 period was due primarily to higher depreciation expense associated with the investment in automated meter-reading in Oklahoma, offset partially by reduced regulatory amortization expense related to the expiration of the integrity-management program rider in Oklahoma.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, net of the change in taxes receivable, and certain other items.

The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
