ONEOK Announces 9-percent Quarterly Dividend Increase
 
Payout Higher Than Previous Guidance
 
 TULSA, Okla.  Jan. 18, 2012  The board of directors of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today increased the quarterly dividend to 61 cents per share of common stock from 56 cents per share, a 5-cent-per-share, or 9-percent, increase, effective for the fourth quarter 2011, payable Feb. 14, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business Jan. 31, 2012.
   
 
 This latest dividend increase is higher than the guidance increase of 4 cents per share that we provided in September 2011 and reflects the continued strong performance in our ONEOK Partners segment, which has resulted in increased distributions to ONEOK from the partnership, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman and chief executive officer. These distributions, combined with strong cash flow from our natural gas distribution segment, enable us to continue providing value to our shareholders in the form of higher dividends.
   
 
 ONEOK indicated in September 2011 that it expects to increase its dividend 50 percent by 2014 and affirmed a long-term dividend payout target of 60 percent to 70 percent of recurring earnings, subject to board of directors' approval. ONEOK announced today it is considering increasing its July 2012 dividend above the 4-cent-increase it provided in September 2011.
   
 
 Since January 2006, the company has increased the dividend 13 times, representing a 118-percent increase during that period.
   
 
ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) is a diversified energy company. We are the general partner and own 42.8 percent of ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS), one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships, which is a leader in the gathering, processing, storage and transportation of natural gas in the U.S. and owns one of the nation's premier natural gas liquids (NGL) systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions with key market centers. ONEOK is among the largest natural gas distributors in the United States, serving more than 2 million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Our energy services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. ONEOK is a FORTUNE 500 company and is included in Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Stock Index.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
 
ONEOK Partners has disclosed in this news release anticipated DCF that is a non-GAAP financial measure. DCF is used as a measure of the partnerships financial performance. DCF is defined as net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, income taxes and allowance for equity funds used during construction, less maintenance capital expenditures and equity earnings from investments, and adjusted for distributions received and certain other items.
 
The partnership believes DCF is useful to investors because it is used by many companies in its industry as a measurement of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate the financial performance of the partnership and to compare the financial performance of the partnership with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships within its industry.
 
DCF should not be considered an alternative to net income, earnings per unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
DCF exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, the calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, DCF should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that is available for distributions or that is planned to be distributed for a given period nor does it equate to available cash as defined in the partnership agreement.
