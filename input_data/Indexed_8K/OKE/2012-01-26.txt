Except as set forth on Annex A hereto, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, capital interests or partnership interests of the Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and, as to capital stock, are fully paid and non-assessable, and are owned by the Company free and clear of all security interests, liens, encumbrances and claims whatsoever.

Agreements
(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus) to the Base Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object, unless, (i) in the judgment of counsel to the Company, such filing is required by applicable law or (ii) is advisable in furtherance of a Commission request. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430B, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in
 
a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of each series of Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to promptly use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(b) To prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in a form approved by the Representatives and substantially as attached as Schedule IV hereto and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
(c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event,
 
(ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of Section 5(a), an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available, via the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) System, to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act, including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158, which may be satisfied through the filing with the Commission of reports required under the Exchange Act.
(f) The Company will furnish or otherwise make available upon request to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering (other than internal sales memoranda prepared by any of the Underwriters).
(g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of each series of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as reasonably required for the distribution of such series of Securities and will pay any fee of FINRA in connection with its review of the offering; in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided that
(h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a Free Writing Prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; the prior written consent
provided that
 
of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such Free Writing Prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is herein referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as applicable and as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
(i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto.
(j) The Company will not, at any time at or after the execution of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Securities by means of any "prospectus" (within the meaning of the Act), or use any "prospectus" (within the meaning of the Act) in connection with the offer or sale of the Securities, in each case other than the Final Prospectus.
6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Applicable Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in Section 1 of this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;

8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any information of the Company that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
Indemnification and Contribution
provided, however
 
omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that (i) the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities, and (ii) the following information under the heading "Underwriting": (A) the second sentence of the third paragraph related to the Underwriters' market making activities, (B) the first and second sentences of the fourth paragraph related to discounts, concessions and reallowances and (C) the sixth, seventh and eighth paragraphs related to over-allotment, stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and only to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
provided, however
 
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, but is otherwise applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided, however
 
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to TIA Section 315) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
(d) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of such Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so.
Notwithstanding TIA Section 316(c), any such record date shall be the record date specified in or pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not more than 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and no later than the date such solicitation is completed.
If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Securities then Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Securities then Outstanding shall be computed as of such record date; provided that no such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security or the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, suffered or omitted to be done by the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
SECTION 105. Notices, etc. to Trustee and Company.

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or delivered, in writing, to the Company addressed to it at: 100 West Fifth Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.
Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders of Securities by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities. Any notice mailed to a Holder in the aforesaid manner shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice.
In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Holders of Securities when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be sufficient giving of such notice for every purpose hereunder.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
SECTION 107. Conflict of any Provision of Indenture with Trust Indenture Act.
If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by TIA Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, or conflicts with any provision (an "incorporated provision") required by or deemed to be included in this Indenture by operation of such TIA Sections, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

shall apply in lieu of this Section), payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, or any such conversion need not take place at such Place of Conversion, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment or such Place of Conversion, as the case may be, with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date or sinking fund payment date, or at the Stated Maturity or Maturity or the conversion date; provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity, as the case may be.
SECTION 114. No Recourse Against Others.
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with such Company Order shall authenticate and make available for delivery such Securities. If not all the Securities of any series are to be issued at one time and if the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities and determining terms of particular Securities of such series such as interest rate, stated maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue.
In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to TIA Sections 315(a) through 315(d)) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:

(4) that all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities, and of the supplemental indentures, if any, have been complied with and that authentication and delivery of such Securities and the execution and delivery of the supplemental indenture, if any, by the Trustee will not violate the terms of the Indenture;
(5) that the Company has the corporate power to issue such Securities, and has duly taken all necessary corporate action with respect to such issuance; and

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding two paragraphs, if not all the Securities of any series are to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs prior to or at the time of issuance of each Security, but such documents shall be delivered prior to or at the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate and make available for delivery any such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties, protections, privileges, indemnities or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such
 
Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 311 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 304. Book-Entry Securities.
(a) The Securities of a series may be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities ("Book-Entry Securities") deposited with, or on behalf of, a Depositary (the "Depositary"). In the case of Book-Entry Securities, one or more Global Securities will be issued in a denomination or aggregate denomination equal to the portion of the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the series to be represented by such Global Security or Global Securities. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, the additional provisions set forth in this Section 304 shall apply to Book-Entry Securities.
(b) Book-Entry Securities will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Depositary, and registered in the name of the Depositary's nominee, for credit to the respective accounts of institutions that have accounts with the Depositary or its nominee ("Participants"); provided that Book-Entry Securities purchased by persons outside the United States may be credited to or through accounts maintained at the Depositary by or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream. The accounts to be credited will be designated by the underwriters or agents of such Securities or, if such Securities are offered and sold directly by the Company, by the Company. Ownership of beneficial interests in Book-Entry Securities will be limited to Persons that may hold interests through Participants and will be shown on records maintained by the Depositary or its nominee for such Book-Entry Security.
Participants shall have no rights under this Indenture or any indenture supplemental hereto with respect to any Book-Entry Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Book-Entry Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of the Book-Entry Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Indenture or any such indenture supplemental shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Participants, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Security.
(c) Transfers of Book-Entry Securities shall be limited to transfers in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in Book-Entry Securities may be transferred or exchanged for Securities in fully registered, certificated form ("Definitive Securities") only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Trustee in writing that the Depositary is no longer willing or able to continue as depositary and a qualified successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days following such notice, (ii) the Company, at any time and in its sole discretion, determines not to have any Securities of one or more series represented by Global Securities or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to such Securities, (A) the Trustee determines to have Definitive
 
Securities issued to all holders of such Securities or (B) a holder of such Securities notifies the Trustee in writing that it wishes to receive a Definitive Security. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Security will be entitled to physical delivery of Definitive Securities equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and registered in its name.
(d) In connection with any transfer or exchange of a portion of the beneficial interest in any Book-Entry Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Security Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the Book-Entry Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Book-Entry Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Definitive Securities of like tenor and principal amount of authorized denominations.
(e) In connection with the transfer of Book-Entry Securities as an entirety to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Book-Entry Securities shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in the Book-Entry Securities, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Securities of like tenor of authorized denominations.
(f) The Holder of any Book-Entry Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Participants and Persons that may hold interests through Participants, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the applicable Indenture or the Securities.
SECTION 305. Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of Definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are typewritten, printed, lithographed, engraved or otherwise produced by any combination of these methods, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Such temporary Securities may be in global form.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause Definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for Definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of Definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations.
 
Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of such series.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series, including temporary Global Securities (whether or not issued as Book-Entry Securities as provided in Section 304), shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as Definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.
SECTION 306. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained in such office of the Trustee and in any other office or agency designated pursuant to Section 1002 being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities.
The Trustee is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Except as otherwise described in this Article Three, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, in each case, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all documentary, stamp, similar issue or transfer taxes or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 305, 906, 1107 or 1405 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of that series under Section 1103 or 1303 and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
SECTION 307. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with, in proper cases, such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, or, in case any such mutilated Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to pay all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 307 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
SECTION 308. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved; Optional Interest Reset.
(a) Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest, if any, on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each installment of interest, if any, on any Security may at the Company's option be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 310, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) wire transfer to an account located in the United States maintained by the payee.
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such defaulted interest and, if applicable, interest on such defaulted interest (to the extent lawful) at the rate specified in the Securities of such series (such defaulted interest and, if applicable, interest thereon herein collectively called "Defaulted Interest") may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Subsection (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Subsection provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given in the manner provided in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so given, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose name the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Subsection (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
(b) The provisions of this Section 308(b) may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301).
The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) on any Security of such series may be reset by the Company on the date or dates specified on the face of such Security (each an "Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Note, which such notice shall contain such information as may be required by the Trustee to transmit the Reset Notice as hereinafter defined). Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of any such Security a notice (the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity Date of such Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable).
The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Fourteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 306, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 309. Optional Extension of Stated Maturity.
The provisions of this Section 309 may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301). The Stated Maturity of any Security of such series may be extended at the option of the Company for the period or periods specified on the face of such Security (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity") set forth on the face of such Security. The Company may exercise such option with respect to any Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such Security in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity"). If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of such Security not later than 40 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice") indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate, if any, applicable to the Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of such Security shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable.
All Securities with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate.
If the Company extends the Maturity of any Security, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity thereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Fourteen for repayment at the option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may by written notice to the Trustee revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.
 
SECTION 310. Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 306 and 308) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Security Registrar or any Conversion Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Depositary, as a Holder, with respect to such Global Security or impair, as between such Depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Security.
SECTION 311. Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer, conversion or exchange or for credit against any current or future sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Securities so delivered to the Trustee shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures, unless by Company Order the Company shall direct that cancelled Securities be returned to it.
SECTION 312. Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any Securities, interest, if any, on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
SECTION 313. CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) in addition to serial numbers, and, if so, the Trustee shall use such "CUSIP" numbers in addition to serial numbers in any notices as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice and that reliance may be placed only on the serial or other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such notice shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such "CUSIP" numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Request (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of such series expressly provided for herein or pursuant hereto) and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series when
(1) either
(A) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, or
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
(iii) if redeemable at the option of the Company, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, or has made arrangements for any such payment satisfactory to the payee; and
 
(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 606, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 612 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Subsection (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
SECTION 402. Application of Trust Money.
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.
SECTION 501. Events of Default.
"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events:
(1) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any Security of such series when it becomes due and payable, continued for 30 days; or
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of such series at its Maturity; or
(3) failure on the part of the Company to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture (other than a covenant or agreement included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of less than all series of Securities or a covenant the default in the performance of which would be covered by clause (7) below) for 60 days after written notice of such failure, requiring the Company to remedy the same, has been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities of such series; or
(4) default under any indenture or instrument under which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has at the time outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantees thereof in any individual instance in excess of $100,000,000 and, if not already matured in accordance with its terms, such indebtedness has been accelerated and such acceleration is not rescinded or annulled within 30 days after notice thereof has been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders
 
of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities of such series; provided that, if, prior to the entry of judgment in favor of the Trustee for payment of the Indenture Securities of such series, the default under such indenture or instrument has been remedied or cured by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, or waived by the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of Default under the Indenture will be deemed likewise to have been remedied, cured or waived; or
(5) the entry of a decree or order by court having jurisdiction in the premises adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable federal or state law, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of the property of the Company, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company, and the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

(7) any other Event of Default provided for the benefit of Securities of such series.
SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If any Event of Default described in Section 501 with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Securities of that series and all accrued interest thereon to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified portion thereof) shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series (or of all series, as the case may be) has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be), by written notice to the Company, and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
 
(a) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) the following;
(1) all overdue interest, if any, on all Outstanding Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be),
(2) all unpaid principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Outstanding Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be) which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, and interest on such unpaid principal (and premium, if any) at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(3) interest upon such overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
(4) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee for such series hereunder and reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(b) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be), other than the non-payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest, if any, on Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be) which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if
(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged, or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series (or of all series, as the case may be) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series (or of all series, as the case may be) under this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.
SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any), or such portion of the principal amount of any series of Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities as may be specified in the terms of such series, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 606.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any proposal, plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition or other similar arrangement affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 606;
Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, respectively; and
Third: The balance, if any, to the Company.
SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of an Event of Default described in Section 501 in its own name as Trustee hereunder,
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority or more in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of the same series, in respect of any Event of Default described in Section 501, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all Holders of Securities of the same series, in respect of such Event of Default.
SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 308) interest, if any, on, such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 307, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 512. Control by Holders.
With respect to the Securities of any series, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, related to or arising under Section 501, provided that in each case (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or expose the Trustee to personal liability, and (2) subject to the provisions of the TIA Section 315, the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.
Subject to Section 502, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default in Section 501 and its consequences, except a Default or Event of Default, (1) in respect of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of Securities of any series by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on Securities of any series on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date); provided that neither this Section 514 nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.
 
SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 601. Notice of Defaults.
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, notice of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series; and provided further that in the case of any default or breach of the character specified in Section 501(3) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.
SECTION 602. Certain Rights of Trustee.
Subject to the provisions of TIA Sections 315(a) through 315(d) which are by this reference hereby incorporated herein:
(1) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

If such Trustee files reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of federal, state, territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 608, the combined capital and surplus of the Trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so filed. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 608, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
SECTION 609. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 610.
(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 610 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may, at the expense of the Company, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the removed Trustee may, at the expense of the Company, petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
(d) If at any time:
 
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of TIA Section 310(b) after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 608 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), the Holder of any Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series). If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with Section 610, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(e) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to the Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided for in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
SECTION 610. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
(a) Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; provided, however, that the retiring Trustee shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of Section 606; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all amounts payable to it pursuant to Section 606, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Whenever there is a successor Trustee with respect to one or more (but less than all) series of securities issued pursuant to this Indenture, the terms "Indenture" and "Securities" shall have the meanings specified in the provisos to the respective definitions of those terms in Section 101 which contemplate such situation.
(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
SECTION 611. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
In case any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any successor Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee. In all such cases such certificates shall have the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee; provided, however, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
SECTION 612. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series and the Trustee shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 106. Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, and a copy of such instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an authorized signatory of an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such corporation files reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so filed. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:

SECTION 613. Collection of Claims Against Company.
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor under the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
SECTION 614. Provisions for Separate Trustees and Co-Trustees.
At any time or times, for the purpose of conforming to any legal requirements, restrictions or conditions in any State or jurisdiction in which any part of any mortgaged and pledged property then subject to this Indenture may be located, or in which any obligor or guarantor under the Securities or any series thereof is located, the Company and the Trustee shall have power to appoint, and, upon the request of the Trustee, the Company shall for such purpose join with the Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of, all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint another corporation or one or more persons approved by the Trustee, either to act as separate trustee or trustees, or co-trustee or co-trustees jointly with the Trustee, with respect to this Indenture and any of the property subject to the lien hereof. In the event that the Company shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment.
Every separate trustee, every co-trustee and every successor trustee, other than any trustee which may be appointed as successor shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following provisions and conditions, namely:
(1) The rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon trustees hereunder or any of them shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee or the Trustees and such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees jointly, as shall be provided in the supplemental indenture appointing such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees.
(2) The Securities issued hereunder shall be authenticated and delivered, and all powers, duties, obligations and rights, conferred upon the Trustee in respect of the custody of the Securities and of all cash and investments pledged or deposited hereunder, shall be exercised solely by the Trustee or its successor in the trust hereunder.
(3) The Company and the Trustee, at any time by an instrument in writing executed by them jointly, may accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee appointed under this Section or otherwise, and, upon the request of the Trustee, the Company shall, for such purpose, join with the Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to make effective such resignation or removal. In the event that the Company shall not have joined in such action within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Trustee alone shall have power to accept such resignation or to remove any such separate trustee or co- trustee. A successor to a separate trustee or co-trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section.
 
(4) No trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder.
Any notice, request or other writing, by or on behalf of the holders of the Securities delivered to the Trustee, or its successor in the trust hereunder, shall be deemed to have been delivered to all of the then trustees or co-trustees as effectually as if delivered to each of them. Every instrument appointing any trustee or trustees other than a successor to the Trustee shall refer to this Indenture and the conditions in this Article expressed, and upon the acceptance in writing by such trustee or trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees, he, they or it shall be vested with the estates or property specified in such instrument, either jointly with the Trustee or its successor, or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the trusts, conditions and provisions of this Indenture; and every such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee or its successor in the trust hereunder. Any separate trustee or trustees, or any co-trustee or co-trustees, may at any time by an instrument in writing constitute the Trustee or its successor in the trust hereunder his, their or its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the extent which may be permitted by law, to do all acts and things and exercise all discretion authorized or permitted by him, them or it, for and on behalf of him, them or it, and in his, their or its name. In case any separate trustee or trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees, or a successor to any of them, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the estates, property, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations of said separate trustee or co-trustee, so far as permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee or its successor in the trust hereunder, without the appointment of a new trustee as successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee.
SECTION 701. Disclosure of Names and Addresses of Holders.
Every Holder of Securities by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that none of the Company or the Trustee or any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with TIA Section 312, regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under TIA Section 312.
SECTION 702. Reports by Trustee.
If required to do so under the TIA, within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with the first May 15 after the first issuance of Securities pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall transmit to the Holders of Securities, in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), a brief report dated as of such May 15 if required by TIA Section 313(a).
 
SECTION 703. Reports by Company.
The Company shall:
(1) file with the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company is required to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of such Sections, then it shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations;
(2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and
(3) transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, in the manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Subsections (1) and (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission.
SECTION 801. Company May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms.
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, any Person, unless:
(1) Immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default (or event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default) shall have happened and be continuing;
(2) The corporation or other entity formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged, or the Person to which such properties and assets will have been conveyed, transferred or leased, assumes the Company's obligation as to the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on all the Securities and the performance and observance of every covenant and obligation to be performed by the Company under the Indenture, and will be organized under the laws of the United States, one of the states thereof or the District of Columbia; and
 
(3) The Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such supplemental indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with.
This Section shall only apply to a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation and to conveyances, leases and transfers by the Company as transferor or lessor.
SECTION 802. Rights and Duties of Successor Corporation.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer to which Section 801 applies and upon any such assumption by the successor corporation or Person, such successor corporation or Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company and the predecessor corporation shall be relieved of any further obligation under this Indenture. Such successor corporation or Person thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the
Company any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation or Person, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor corporation or Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. As used in this Section, "successor corporation or Person" means the corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged, or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, in each case as provided in Section 801.
SECTION 803. Securities to be Secured in Certain Events.
If, upon any such consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other corporation, or upon any conveyance, transfer or lease of the property of the Company substantially as the entirety to any other Person, any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Securities owned immediately prior thereto, would become or be subject to any Lien, then unless such Lien could be created pursuant to Section 1006 without equally and ratably securing the Securities, the Company prior to or simultaneously with such transaction will, as to such Principal Property or Restricted Securities, secure the Securities Outstanding hereunder (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other Indebtedness of the Company now existing or hereafter created which is not subordinate to the Securities) equally and ratably with
 
(or prior to) the Indebtedness which upon such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is to become secured as to such Principal Property or Restricted Securities by such Lien, or will cause such Securities to be so secured; provided that for the purpose of providing such equal and ratable security the principal amount of Original Issue Discount Securities and Indexed Securities shall mean that amount which, at the time of making such provision of such equal and ratable security, would be due and payable pursuant to Section 502 and the terms of such Original Issue Discount Securities and Indexed Securities upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof, and the extent of such equal and ratable security shall be adjusted, to the extent permitted by law, as and when said amount changes over time pursuant to the terms of such Original Issue Discount Securities and Indexed Securities.
SECTION 901. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Holders.
Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, for any of the following purposes:
(1) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company or successive successions and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities; or
(2) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such covenants are being included solely for the benefit of such series) as the Board of Directors determines to be for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities or to surrender any right or power herein or in the Securities conferred upon the Company; or
(3) to add any additional Events of Default (and if such Events of Default are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that such Events of Default are being included solely for the benefit of such series); or
(4) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no Security Outstanding of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision; or
(5) to secure the Securities pursuant to the requirements of Section 803 or 1006 or otherwise; or
(6) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 201 and 301; or
 
(7) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee or co-trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 610(b) or Section 614; or
(8) to close this Indenture with respect to the authentication and delivery of additional series of Securities; or
(9) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture; provided that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series; or
(10) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Sections 401, 1502 and 1503; provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of such series or any other series of Securities; or
(11) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property to or with the Trustee, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, as shall not adversely affect the interests of any Holders of Securities of any series; or
(12) to modify or amend this Indenture in such a manner as to permit the qualification of this Indenture or any indenture supplemental hereto under the TIA as then in effect, except that nothing herein contained shall permit or authorize the inclusion in any indenture supplemental hereto of the provisions referred to in Section 316(a)(2) of the TIA; or
(13) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on, Securities; provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities of any series in any material respect or permit or facilitate the issuance of Securities of any series in uncertificated form; or
(14) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities; provided, however, that any such addition, change or elimination not otherwise permitted under this Section 9.01 shall neither apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or shall become effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding; or
(15) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.
 
SECTION 902. Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders.
With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of such Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into one or more indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture amendment or waiver shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby:
(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of (or premium, if any) or any installment of interest on any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof (or premium, if any) or the rate of interest, if any, thereon (except as contemplated by Section 801(2) and permitted by Section 901(1)), or reduce the amount of the principal of an Indexed Security or an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502 or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy pursuant to Section 504, or adversely affect any right of repayment at the option of any Holder of any Security, or change any Place of Payment where, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption or repayment at the option of the Holder, on or after the Redemption Date or Repayment Date, as the case may be), or adversely affect any right to convert or exchange any Security as may be provided pursuant to Section 301 herein, or
(2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or
(3) modify any of the provisions of this Section 902, Section 513 or Section 1009, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby.
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
 
SECTION 903. Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d) and Section 602 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, protections, privileges, indemnities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
SECTION 904. Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
SECTION 905. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.
Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.

Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
SECTION 907. Notice of Supplemental Indentures.
Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of Sections 901 and 902, the Company shall give notice thereof to the Holders of each Outstanding Security affected, in the manner provided for in Section 106, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture.
 
SECTION 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the Securities of such series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
SECTION 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for Securities of such series an office or agency where Securities of such series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of such series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of such series may be presented for conversion and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such series and this Indenture may be served.
The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities, the Company hereby designates as Places of Payment for each series of Securities the office or agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, and initially appoints the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office in Atlanta, Georgia and at the office of its agent in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York as Paying Agent in each such city as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands, and as Conversion Agent in each such city as its agent to receive Securities for conversion.
SECTION 1003. Money for Security Payments to Be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it shall, before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such) sufficient to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if
 
any, on Securities of such Series so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities it will, prior to or on each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on any Securities of such series, deposit with the Paying Agent, a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any, on) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company shall cause each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) for any series of Securities to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on Securities of such series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the Securities of such series; and
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms as those upon which sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for the earlier of the applicable escheat laws or two years after such principal (and premium, if any, on) or interest has become due and payable, shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money
 
remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
SECTION 1004. Statement as to Compliance.
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 150 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with its fiscal year ending after the date hereof, a brief certificate from its principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer as to his or her knowledge of the compliance by the Company with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture. For purposes of this Section 1004, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice under this Indenture.
SECTION 1005. Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article Eight, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its respective corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises and the respective corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such existence, right or franchise if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of it and its Subsidiaries as a whole and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
SECTION 1006. Limitations on Liens.
The Company covenants and agrees that it will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, issue or assume any Indebtedness secured by any Lien on any Principal Property, or on shares of stock or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary ("Restricted Securities"), without making effective provision for the Outstanding Securities (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of any series) to be secured by the Lien equally and ratably with (or prior to) any and all Indebtedness and obligations secured or to be secured thereby for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, except that the foregoing restriction will not apply to:
(1) Any Lien existing on the date of the first issuance of Securities under the Indenture.
(2) Any Lien on any Principal Property or Restricted Securities of any Person existing at the time such Person is merged or consolidated with or into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary.

(4) Any Lien on any Principal Property (including any improvements on an existing Principal Property) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and any Lien on the shares of stock of a Restricted Subsidiary that was formed or is held for the purpose of acquiring and holding such Principal Property, in each case to secure all or any part of the cost of acquisition, development, operation, construction, alteration, repair or improvement of all or any part of such Principal Property (or to secure Indebtedness incurred by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary for the purpose of financing all or any part of such cost); provided that such Lien is created prior to, at the time of, or within 12 months after the latest of, the acquisition, completion of construction or improvement or commencement of commercial operation of such Principal Property and provided, further, that no such Lien may extend to any other Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than any theretofore unimproved real property on which the Principal Property is so constructed or developed or the improvement is located.
(5) Any Lien on any Principal Property or Restricted Securities to secure Indebtedness owing to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary.
(6) Any Lien in favor of governmental bodies to secure advances or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure Indebtedness incurred to finance the purchase price or cost of constructing or improving the property subject to such Lien.
(7) Any Lien created in connection with a project financed with, and created to secure, Non-Recourse Indebtedness.
(8) Carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics', landlords', materialmen's, repairmen's or other similar Liens arising in the ordinary course of business which are not delinquent or remain payable without penalty or which are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings.
(9) Liens (other than Liens imposed by ERISA) on the property of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred, or pledges or deposits required, in connection with workmen's compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation.
(10) Liens securing taxes that remain payable without penalty or which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings where collection thereof is stayed; provided that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has set aside on its books reserves with respect to such taxes (segregated to the extent required by GAAP) deemed by it to be adequate.
(11) Any right which any municipal or governmental body or agency may have by virtue of any franchise, license or contract to purchase or designate a purchaser of, or order the sale of, any property of the Company upon payment of reasonable compensation therefor or to terminate any franchise, license or other rights or to regulate the property and business of the Company.
(12) Any Liens, neither assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or on which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary customarily pays interest, existing upon real estate or rights in or relating to real estate acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for sub-station, measuring station, regulating station, gas purification station, compressor station, transmission line, distribution line or right-of-way purposes.
 
(13) Easements or reservations in any property of the Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary for the purpose of roads, pipe lines, gas transmission and distribution lines, electric light and power transmission and distribution lines, water mains and other like purposes, and zoning ordinances, regulations and restrictions which do not impair the use of such property in the operation of the business of the Company or of any Restricted Subsidiary.
(14) Any extension, renewal, substitution or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals, substitutions or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in the foregoing clauses (l) through (13), provided that the Indebtedness secured thereby may not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness so secured at the time of such renewal or refunding, and that such renewal or refunding Lien must be limited to all or any part of the same property and improvements thereon, shares of stock or Indebtedness that secured the Lien renewed or refunded.
(15) Any Lien not permitted above securing Indebtedness that, together with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of other secured Indebtedness that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (excluding Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted under the foregoing exceptions) and the Attributable Debt in respect of all Sale and Leaseback Transactions (not including Attributable Debt in respect of any such Sale and Leaseback Transactions described in clause (3) or (4) of Section 1007) would not then exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.
SECTION 1007. Limitations on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.
The Company covenants and agrees that it will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction unless (i) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled, without securing the Outstanding Securities, to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Principal Property that is the subject of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction; (ii) the Attributable Debt associated therewith would be in an amount permitted under clause (15) of Section 1006 hereof; (iii) the proceeds received in respect of the Principal Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction are used for the business and operations of the Company or any Subsidiary; or (iv) within 12 months after the sale or transfer, an amount equal to the proceeds received in respect of the Principal Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is applied to the prepayment (other than mandatory prepayment) of any Outstanding Securities or Funded Indebtedness of the Company or of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Funded Indebtedness that is held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or Funded Indebtedness of the Company that is subordinate in right of payment to any Outstanding Securities).
 
SECTION 1008. Reserved.
SECTION 1009. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Section 803 or Sections 1005 to 1007, inclusive, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities, by Act of such Holders, waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 1101. Applicability of Article.
Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
SECTION 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company, the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and shall deliver to the Trustee such documentation and records as shall enable the Trustee to select the Securities to be redeemed pursuant to Section 1103. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction.
SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions of the principal of Securities of such series; provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Security not redeemed to less than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series established pursuant to Section 301.
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided for in Section 106 not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.
All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities (including CUSIP number, if any) to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date,
(2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if any,
(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed,
(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder will receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,
(5) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106 will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
(6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, and
(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
 
SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued interest, if any, on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series)(together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest, and except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 308.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security.
SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Article Thirteen) shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
 
SECTION 1201. Conversion.
If the Board Resolution establishing the terms of a series of Securities so provides, Securities of any series may be convertible at the option of the Holders or otherwise into or for Common Stock or other equity or debt securities (a "Conversion Right"). The Board Resolution may establish, among other things, the Conversion Rate, provisions for adjustments to the Conversion Rate and limitations upon exercise of the Conversion Right.
Unless the Board Resolution otherwise provides, a Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the conversion of the aggregate principal amount of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of it.
The Board Resolution providing for Securities with a Conversion Right may establish any terms in addition to, or other than (including terms inconsistent with), those set forth in this Article Twelve with respect to the conversion of the Securities established thereby.
SECTION 1202. Conversion Procedure.
To convert a Security a Holder must satisfy all applicable requirements in the Securities or the Board Resolution and, if required, (i) complete and manually sign the conversion notice (the "Conversion Notice") provided for in the Board Resolution or the Security (or complete and manually sign a facsimile thereof) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent or any other office or agency maintained for such purpose, (ii) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent or at such other office or agency by physical delivery, (iii) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (iv) pay all transfer or similar taxes. The date on which such notice shall have been received by and the Security shall have been so surrendered to the Conversion Agent is the "Conversion Date." Such Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn by a Holder for any reason.
The Company will complete settlement of any conversion of Securities not later than the fifth Business Day following the Conversion Date in respect of the cash portion elected to be delivered in lieu of the securities into which the Security is convertible and not later than the seventh Business Day following the Conversion Date in respect of the portion to be settled in such securities.
If any Security is converted between the Regular Record Date for the payment of interest and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Security must be accompanied by funds equal to the interest payable on such succeeding Interest Payment Date on the principal amount so converted (unless such Security shall have been called for redemption during such period, in which case no such payment shall be required). A Security converted on an Interest Payment Date need not be accompanied by any payment, and the interest on the principal amount of the Security being converted will be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the registered holder of such Security on the immediately preceding Regular Record Date. Subject to the aforesaid right of the registered holder to receive interest, no payment or adjustment will be made on conversion for interest accrued on the converted Security or for interest, dividends or other distributions payable on any security issued on conversion.
 
If a Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the securities into which the Security is convertible which are issuable upon such conversion or the cash payable upon the conversion shall be based on the total principal amount of the Securities converted.
Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall authenticate for the Holder a new Security of the same series equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered the Trustee shall authenticate and, if applicable, deliver to the depository a new Global Security of the same series in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unconverted portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered.
If the last day on which a Security may be converted is not a Business Day in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Security may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding Business Day.
SECTION 1203. Taxes on Conversion.
If a Holder of a Security exercises a Conversion Right, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of the securities into which the Security is convertible upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because securities or other property are issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any income tax or other withholding required by law or regulations.
SECTION 1204. Company Determination Final.
Any determination that the Board of Directors makes pursuant to this Article Twelve or consistent with terms provided for in any Board Resolution is conclusive, absent manifest error.
SECTION 1205. Trustee's and Conversion Agent's Disclaimer.
The Trustee (and each Conversion Agent other than the Company) has no duty to determine when or if an adjustment under this Article Twelve or any Board Resolution should be made, how it should be made or calculated or what it should be. The Trustee (and each Conversion Agent other than the Company) makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities issued upon conversion of Securities. The Trustee (and each Conversion Agent other than the Company) shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article Twelve or any provision of a Board Resolution relating to a Conversion Right.
SECTION 1206. Company to Provide Conversion Securities.
The Company shall reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its Common Stock held in treasury sufficient shares to permit the conversion of all of the Securities convertible into Common Stock. The Company shall arrange and make available for issuance upon conversion the full amount of any other securities into which the Securities are convertible to permit such conversion of the Securities.
 
All shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of any person which may be issued upon conversion of the Securities shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
The Company will comply with all securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of securities upon conversion of Securities.
SECTION 1207. Cash Settlement Option.
If the Board Resolution so provides, the Company may elect to satisfy, in whole or in part, a Conversion Right of Securities convertible into Common Stock or other securities of any person by the delivery of cash. Except as the Board Resolution so provides: (a) the amount of cash to be delivered shall be equal to the Market Price on the last Trading Day preceding the applicable Conversion Date of a share of Common Stock or other securities of any person into which the Securities are convertible multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock or the number of shares or principal amount of other securities into which the Securities are convertible, respectively, in respect of which the Company elects to deliver cash; (b) if the Company elects to satisfy, in whole or in part, a Conversion Right by the delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities, no fractional shares or portion of other securities will be delivered. Instead, the Company will pay cash based on the Market Price for such fractional share of Common Stock or portion of other securities; and (c) the "Market Price" of the Common Stock into which Securities or other equity securities into which the Securities are convertible may be converted pursuant to a Board Resolution or this Article Twelve on any Trading Day means the weighted average per share sale price for all sales of the Common Stock or other equity securities on such Trading Day (or, if the information necessary to calculate such weighted average per share sale price is not reported, the average of the high and low sale prices, or if no sales are reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and average ask prices), as reported in the composite transactions for the New York Stock Exchange, or if the Common Stock or other equity securities into which the Securities are convertible are not listed or admitted to trading on such exchange, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal national or regional United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock or other equity securities into which the Securities are convertible are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Common Stock or other equity securities into which the Securities are convertible are not listed or admitted to trading on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by NASDAQ or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or if not so reported, as determined in the manner set forth in the appropriate Board Resolution. In the absence of such quotations, the Company shall be entitled to determine the Market Price on the basis of such quotations as it considers appropriate.
The "Market Price" of any debt security into which Securities are convertible shall be determined as set forth in the applicable Board Resolution.
 
SECTION 1301. Applicability of Article.
Retirements of Securities of any series pursuant to any sinking fund shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any mandatory sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1302. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
SECTION 1302. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
Subject to Section 1303, in lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (1) deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company and/or (2) receive credit for the principal amount of Securities of such series which have been previously delivered to the Trustee by the Company or for Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of the same series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; provided, however, that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
SECTION 1303. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering or crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 1302 (which Securities will, if not previously delivered, accompany such certificate) and whether the Company intends to exercise its right to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment with
 
respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate, the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Securities as provided in Section 1302 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Not more than 60 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
Prior to any sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee or a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) in cash a sum equal to any interest that will accrue to the date fixed for redemption of Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 1303.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a sinking fund for any series of Securities, if at any time the amount of cash to be paid into such sinking fund on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date, together with any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payment or payments for such series, does not exceed in the aggregate $100,000, the Trustee, unless requested by the Company, shall not give the next succeeding notice of the redemption of Securities of such series through the operation of the sinking fund. Any such unused balance of moneys deposited in such sinking fund shall be added to the sinking fund payment for such series to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date or, at the written request of the Company, shall be applied at any time or from time to time to the purchase of Securities of such series, by public or private purchase, in the open market or otherwise, at a purchase price for such Securities (excluding accrued interest and brokerage commissions, for which the Trustee or any Paying Agent will be promptly reimbursed by the Company) not in excess of the principal amount thereof.
SECTION 1401. Applicability of Article.
Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article.
 
SECTION 1402. Repayment of Securities.
Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest, if any, on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date.
SECTION 1403. Exercise of Option.
Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company.
SECTION 1404. When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable.
If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and except to the extent provided below, shall be void.
 
Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date; provided, however, that, in the case of Securities, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 308.
If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security.
SECTION 1405. Securities Repaid in Part.
Upon surrender of any Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.
SECTION 1501. Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, the provisions of this Article Fifteen shall apply to each series of Securities, and the Company may, at its option, effect defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1502, or covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1503 in accordance with the terms of such Securities and in accordance with this Article.
SECTION 1502. Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities on the date the conditions set forth in Section 1504 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 1505 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (A) and (B) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the
 
rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1504 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 305, 306, 307, 1002 and 1003, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article Fifteen. Subject to compliance with this Article Fifteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 1502 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 1503 with respect to such Securities.
SECTION 1503. Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company's exercise under Section 1501 of the option applicable to this Section 1503 with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1006 and 1007, and if specified pursuant to Section 301, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such Outstanding Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1504 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed Outstanding for financial accounting purposes). For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 501(3) or Section 501(7) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
SECTION 1504. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 1502 or Section 1503 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series:
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 608 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article Fifteen applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (A) an amount or (B) Government Obligations applicable to such Securities which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, under such Securities money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other
 
qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, (i) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Securities on the Stated Maturity (or Redemption Date, if applicable) of such principal (and premium, if any) or installment of interest, if any, and (ii) any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to such Outstanding Securities on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to said payments with respect to such Securities. Before such a deposit, the Company may give to the Trustee, in accordance with Section 1102 hereof, a notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of such Outstanding Securities at a future date in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series and Article Eleven hereof, which notice shall be irrevocable. Such irrevocable redemption notice, if given, shall be given effect in applying the foregoing.
(2) No Default or Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as paragraphs (5) and (6) of Section 501 are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).

(6) In the case of an election under Section 1503, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.
 
(7) In the case of an election under either Section 1502 or 1503, the Company shall represent to the Trustee that the deposit made by the Company pursuant to its election under Section 1502 or 1503 was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Securities of any series over other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 301) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 1505, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1504 in respect of such Outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1504 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities.
Anything in this Article Fifteen to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 1504 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
 
SECTION 1506. Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 1505 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and such Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 1502 or 1503, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 1505; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any such Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed all as of the day and year first above written.

January 26, 2012
ONEOK, Inc.
100 West Fifth Street
Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are acting as counsel to ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177048) (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the issuance of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Notes due 2022 (the "Debt Securities") of the Company. The Debt Securities are being offered and sold by the Company in a public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of January 26, 2012 by and between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). With your permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made without any independent investigation or verification on our part except to the extent otherwise expressly stated, and we express no opinion with respect to the subject matter or accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.
The Debt Securities are issuable pursuant to a senior debt indenture, dated as of January 26, 2012, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") (as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 26, 2012, the "Indenture").
In connection with this opinion, we have (i) investigated such questions of law, (ii) examined originals or certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or reproduction copies, of such agreements, instruments, documents and records of the Company, such certificates of public officials and such other documents, and (iii) received such information from officers and representatives of the Company and others, in each case as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. We have examined, among other documents, the following:
 
 
 
The documents referred to in items (a) through (c) above, inclusive, are referred to herein collectively as the "Documents."
In all such examinations, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of original and certified documents and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us as certified, conformed, facsimile, electronic or reproduction copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to the opinion expressed herein, we have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, the representations and warranties contained in the Documents, certificates and oral or written statements and other information of or from officers or other appropriate representatives of the Company and others and assume compliance on the part of all parties to the Documents with their respective covenants and agreements contained therein.
We have assumed, for purposes of the opinion expressed herein, that (i) all of the parties to the Documents are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization; (ii) all of the parties to the Documents have the power and authority to (a) execute and deliver the Documents, (b) perform their obligations thereunder and (c) consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) each of the Documents has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all of the parties thereto; (iv) each of the Documents constitutes a valid and binding obligation of all the parties thereto (other than as expressly addressed in the opinion below as to the Company), enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms; (v) the Debt Securities have been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee against payment therefor in accordance with the Agreements; (vi) all of the parties to the Documents will comply with all laws applicable thereto; and (vii) the Debt Securities conform to the specimen thereof examined by us.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Debt Securities, when paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Agreements, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications:
