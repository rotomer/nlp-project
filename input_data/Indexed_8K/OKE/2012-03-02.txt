If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, the Partnership and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing.
If the sale to the Underwriters of the Offered Units, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this Agreement, or if such sale is not carried out because the Partnership shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Partnership shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(m), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Partnership under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another hereunder.
 
8. . Subject to Sections 6 and 7 hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Firm Units to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6 hereof or a reason sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the number of Firm Units which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total number of Firm Units, the non-defaulting Underwriters (including the Underwriters, if any, substituted in the manner set forth below) shall take up and pay for (in addition to the aggregate number of Firm Units they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the number of Firm Units agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such Offered Units shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Offered Units shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of Firm Units set forth opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in .
Increase in Underwriters' Commitments
Schedule A
Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Partnership agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that they will not sell any Firm Units hereunder unless all of the Firm Units are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Partnership or selected by the Partnership with your approval).
If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Partnership for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Partnership or you shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.
The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in hereto.
Schedule A
If the aggregate number of Firm Units which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total number of Firm Units which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Partnership shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Firm Units which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Partnership to any Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter to the Partnership. Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
9. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Partnership agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based (i) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Offered Units, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Partnership or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more of the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Partnership will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Partnership may otherwise have.
provided,
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, each of the respective directors and officers of the General Partner and each person who controls the Partnership within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and only to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
 
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) effected without its written consent, but, if settled with its written consent, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this Section 9(c), then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have fully reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided,
however
 
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, but is otherwise applicable in accordance with its terms, the Partnership and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively, "") to which the Partnership and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Partnership on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Units; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Offered Units) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Offered Units purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Partnership and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Partnership shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Partnership, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Partnership within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the General Partner shall have the same rights to contribution as the Partnership, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
Losses
provided,
however
10. . The statements set forth in the last paragraph on the cover page of the Prospectus and the statements set forth in the second sentence of the first paragraph under the subheading "Commissions and Discounts" and under the subheading "Price Stabilization, Short Positions" under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus, only insofar as such statements relate to the amount of selling concession and reallowance or to over-allotment and stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in Sections 3 and 9 hereof.
Information Furnished by the Underwriters
 
11. . The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 9 hereof and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Partnership contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors or officers or any person (including each partner, officer or director of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Partnership, each of the directors or officers of the General Partner or any person who controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Offered Units. The Partnership and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Partnership, against any of the General Partner's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Units, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Basic Prospectus, any Pre-Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.

February 28, 2012
ONEOK, Inc.
100 West Fifth Street
Tulsa, OK 74103
Attention Stephen Lake, Esq.:
ONEOK Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to issue and sell to ONEOK, Inc. (the "Investor"), an aggregate of 8,000,000 common units (the "Investor Units") representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the "Common Units").
This is to confirm the agreement between the Partnership and the Investor concerning the purchase of the Investor Units from the Partnership by the Investor.
1. .
Representations, Warranties and Agreements
(a) The Partnership, represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Investor that:
(i) The Partnership has been duly formed and is validly existing in good standing as a limited partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partner Act (the "Delaware Act") with full partnership power and authority necessary to enter into this Agreement.
(ii) As of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3), the Investor Units, and the limited partner interests represented thereby, will be duly authorized by the Partnership's Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement dated as of September 15, 2006 (the "Partnership Agreement") and, when issued and delivered to the Investor against payment therefor in accordance with the terms hereof, will be validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required under the Partnership Agreement) and nonassessable.
(iii) The Partnership has all requisite power and authority to issue, sell and deliver the Investor Units, in accordance with and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement.
(iv) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Partnership.

(i) Investor is an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the investment by the Investor in the Partnership is for its own account and not for the account of others, for investment purposes. The Investor Units are being acquired for its own account, for investment and with no intention of distributing or reselling such Investor Units or any portion thereof or interest therein in any transaction which would be a violation of the securities laws of the United States of America or any state or foreign country or jurisdiction.
 
(ii) Investor acknowledges and agrees that it has been provided, to its full satisfaction, with the opportunity to ask questions concerning the terms and conditions of an investment in the Partnership and has knowingly and voluntarily elected instead to rely solely on its own investigation.
(iii) Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Investor must bear the economic risk of this investment indefinitely, that the Investor Units purchased by the Investor hereunder may not be sold or transferred or offered for sale or transfer by it without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws or the availability of exemptions therefrom, and that the Partnership has no present intention of registering the resale of any of such Investor Units.
(iv) Investor has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Investor Units, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment.

(v) Investor understands that the Investor Units are being offered and sold to the Investor in reliance upon specific exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state securities laws and that the Partnership is relying upon the truth and accuracy of, and Investor's compliance with, the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments and understandings, which are true, correct and complete, of the Investor set forth herein in order to determine the availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of the Investor to acquire the Investor Units.
(vi) Investor has a substantive pre-existing relationship with the Partnership and was directly contacted by the Partnership or its agents outside of the Partnership's concurrent public offering of 8,000,000 common units (the "Public Offering"). The Investor (i) was not identified or contacted through the marketing of the Public Offering and (ii) did not independently contact the Partnership as a result of the general solicitation by means of the prospectus for the Public Offering.
(vii) Investor has all requisite power and authority to purchase the Investor Units, in accordance with and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
(viii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Investor.
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Partnership agrees to sell to the Investor, and the Investor hereby agrees to purchase from the Partnership, at a purchase price equal to $57.48 per common unit, which is equal to the public offering price of the common units being offered in the Public Offering, less the underwriting discount related thereto.
