 Exhibit 99.3
 
ONEOK Partners to Invest $340 Million to $360 Million for
Additional Growth Projects in Cana-Woodford Shale
 
Projects Include New Natural Gas Processing Plant in Western Oklahoma
 
TULSA, Okla.  Apr. 19, 2012  ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE: OKS) today announced plans to invest approximately $340 million to $360 million between now and the first quarter of 2014 to construct a new natural gas gathering and processing plant and related infrastructure in the Cana-Woodford Shale in Oklahoma.
 
These investments include approximately $190 million for the construction of a new 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) natural gas processing facility  the Canadian Valley plant  in Canadian County, Okla.  which is expected to be in service first quarter of 2014.
 
In addition to the investments for the Canadian Valley plant, ONEOK Partners also expects to invest approximately $160 million for expansions and upgrades to its existing natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure, increasing the partnerships capacity to gather and process natural gas to 390 MMcf/d in the Cana-Woodford Shale.
 
Additional natural gas processing infrastructure is necessary to accommodate increased production of liquids-rich natural gas in the Cana-Woodford Shale where we have substantial acreage dedications from active producers, said Pierce H. Norton, executive vice president and chief operating officer of ONEOK Partners.  The new Canadian Valley plant will be located in the center of the prolific Cana-Woodford Shale and in close proximity to the partnerships existing natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines.
 
When completed, the Canadian Valley plant will be the partnerships largest natural gas processing facility in Oklahoma and will increase the partnerships total natural gas processing capacity in the state to 690 MMcf/d.  Additionally, the natural gas liquids produced from the new plant is expected to add incremental volumes to the partnerships extensive Oklahoma natural gas liquids system.
 
The partnership now has announced a total investment of $4.7 billion to $5.7 billion through 2015 for growth projects in natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas liquids and crude-oil infrastructure.

Of these projects, approximately $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion are for natural gas gathering and processing projects, which, in aggregate, are expected to generate EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples of five to seven times.  The incremental earnings from these projects are expected to increase distributable cash flow and value to unitholders in the form of higher distributions.
 
The partnership has a $1 billion-plus backlog of unannounced growth projects that it continues to evaluate.  Additional projects included in this backlog will be announced when sufficient supply commitments are completed.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
 ONEOK Partners has disclosed in this news release anticipated EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow levels that are non-GAAP financial measures.  EBITDA and DCF are used as a measure of the partnerships financial performance.  EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and allowance equity funds used during construction.  DCF is defined as EBITDA, computed as described above, less interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and equity earnings from investments, adjusted for cash and certain other items.
 
The partnership believes the non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because these measurements are used by many companies in its industry as a measurement of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate the financial performance of the partnership and to compare the financial performance of the partnership with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships within its industry.
 
 EBITDA and DCF should not be considered an alternative to net income, earnings per unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that is available for distributions or that is planned to be distributed for a given period nor do they equate to available cash as defined in the partnership agreement.
