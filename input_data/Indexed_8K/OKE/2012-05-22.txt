Kansas Gas Service Seeks Approval of New Rates
 
OVERLAND PARK, Kan.  May 18, 2012  Kansas Gas Service, a division of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE), announced today that it has filed a request with the Kansas Corporation Commission to increase its overall annual revenues by $32.7 million. The request includes a $50.7 million increase in base rates and an $18 million reduction in amounts currently recovered through surcharges.
 
Since its last adjustment in base rates in January 2007, Kansas Gas Service has invested more than $250 million in its natural gas distribution system, which stretches approximately 18,000 miles throughout Kansas and serves more than 630,000 customers.
 
This rate request reflects the significant investment we have made in our Kansas pipeline infrastructure and facilities to deliver natural gas safely and reliably to our customers, said Brad Dixon, president of Kansas Gas Service.
 
Although the company has implemented measures to hold down costs and maximize efficiency in operations, Dixon also cited continuing increases in labor, health care and pension costs since the companys last rate case as contributing factors to the filing. This request balances our customers needs with the companys and its investors needs to earn a fair and reasonable return on our investment in the natural gas distribution system.
 
If approved, this request would increase the typical residential customers monthly natural gas bill by approximately $5.68, or 9.1 percent; the average commercial customer, who uses 288 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas per year, would not experience an increase in their bill.
 
The Kansas Corporation Commission has 240 days to issue a ruling on Kansas Gas
Services application.
 
Kansas Gas Service provides clean, reliable natural gas to more than 630,000 customers in 337 communities in Kansas.   It is a division of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE), a diversified energy company.
