Exhibit 99.2
 
ONEOK Chairman Tells Shareholders Net Income Expected to Grow
18 Percent Annually Between 2012-2014;
Dividend Expected to Grow 40 Percent during Same Period
 
Growth Driven Primarily by Volume Increases
 
Also Highlights Commitment to
Environmental, Safety and Health Performance Improvement
 
TULSA, Okla.  May 23, 2012  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John W. Gibson today told shareholders at the companys annual meeting that the company expects to increase its net income by approximately 18 percent annually between 2012 and 2014, compared with 2012 earnings guidance, driven primarily by incremental earnings to ONEOK from the growth at ONEOK Partners (NYSE: OKS).
 
He also told shareholders the company expects to increase its dividend by approximately 40 percent between 2012 and 2014, which includes a projected dividend increase of 5 cents per share on a pre-split basis in July 2012, subject to ONEOK board approval. Compared with its 2011 annual dividend of $2.16 per share, this increase represents a 64-percent increase.
 
Most importantly, projected dividend and net income growth at ONEOK is expected to be driven primarily by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth at ONEOK Partners, not by higher projected commodity prices or wider price differentials, said Gibson. And ONEOK shareholders should continue to benefit from the incremental earnings generated by ONEOK Partners completion of its more than $5 billion internal-growth program, expected to be completed by 2015.
 
He also said that the companys investment in ONEOK Partners  through its 2-percent general partner interest and limited partner interests that together represent a 43.4-percent total ownership interest  continues to benefit ONEOK and fulfill the partnerships role as ONEOKs growth engine. In 2011, ONEOK received $333 million in total distributions from ONEOK Partners, compared with $145 million in 2006, the first year ONEOK was the sole general partner.

As ONEOK Partners grows, ONEOK grows, said Gibson. The partnerships current plans to invest an additional $4.7 billion to $5.6 billion for natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude-oil infrastructure in and around our existing operational footprint should result in increased earnings and cash distributions paid to ONEOK.
 
Gibson said ONEOK Partners expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to increase approximately 20 percent annually between 2012 and 2014, compared with 2012 earnings guidance.  The partnership has estimated a 2.5-cent-per-unit-per-quarter increase in unitholder distributions in 2012 and an average annual distribution increase of 15 to 20 percent in 2013 and 2014. Actual unitholder distribution declarations are subject to ONEOK Partners board approval.
 
The partnership provided the following table that includes the 2012 to 2014 average unhedged price assumptions used in these growth estimates.
 
 
Gibson said that if 2013 and 2014 commodity prices  crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids  remained at the levels assumed in 2012 guidance, 2012 to 2014 earnings growth projections at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners would be reduced by only one percentage point annually.
 
He also highlighted the companys entry into the crude-oil transportation business through the partnerships previously announced plans to build a 1,300-mile crude-oil pipeline that will transport light-sweet crude oil from the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin in North Dakota to the Cushing, Oklahoma, crude-oil market hub.
 
Gibson said ONEOK had an exceptionally strong performance in 2011, led by its ONEOK Partners segment, which increased its volumes and benefited from its integrated midstream natural gas and natural gas liquids assets.
 
He said the companys natural gas distribution segment should continue to benefit from successful rate and risk-mitigation strategies, combined with targeted capital investments that provide value to investors and its 2 million customers.  He noted that the companys energy services segment continues to operate in the most challenging natural gas marketing environment

in a decade, but that the segment has become an increasingly smaller percentage of ONEOKs total operating income, approximately 2 percent in 2011.
 
Total shareholder return for ONEOK shareholders during the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year timeframes has significantly exceeded the S&P 500 index and the S&P 500 utilities index, according to Gibson.   In 2011, ONEOK earned a total shareholder return of 61 percent compared with returns of 20 percent for the S&P 500 utilities index and 2 percent for the S&P 500 index, he said.
 
Gibson also praised the companys environmental, safety and health (ESH) initiatives. We continue to make progress to strengthen and improve our environmental, safety and health performance, which is a top priority in everything that we do, he said.
 
He noted that the company is executing to achieve by 2013 specific environmental, safety and health performance goals that include:
  Improving its safety performance metrics by 50 percent compared with 2009;
  Achieving business-segment ESH performance in the top-25 percent of our peer companies;
  Adding an additional environmental component to company ESH management systems companywide;
  Establishing a behavior-based safety program companywide;
  Reviewing company resource use, such as water, electricity and fuel;
  Developing initiatives to achieve annual environmental footprint reductions on a per-unit basis;
  Expanding companywide ESH policies, procedures and training programs;
  Establishing formal ESH audit and risk-assessment programs; and
employees and contractors to strengthen and sustain company ESH initiatives.
  Establishing an ESH culture, in which employees not only do their part as individuals, but also work together with fellow  
interdependent
By achieving these specific goals, we expect to build on the progress we have already made and will continue to make future ESH improvements a priority, Gibson said.
 
We want to be recognized as a leader in protecting the environment, safety and health of our employees, contractors, customers and the public.  To reach that goal, weve still got a ways to go; however, we are taking the steps necessary to move us to that pinnacle of achievement, he stated.
 
Gibson also thanked and recognized the companys 4,800 employees for the companys continued success, noting employees are the ones whose creativity, execution and hard work get

things done for you, our shareholders.  The talent, commitment and dedication of our employees are what distinguish us from our competitors  and ultimately make us successful.
 
NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES)
FINANCIAL MEASURE
 
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release anticipated EBITDA levels that is a non-GAAP financial measure for ONEOK Partners.  EBITDA is used as a measure of the partnerships financial performance.  EBITDA is defined as ONEOK Partners net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and allowance for equity funds used during construction attributable to ONEOK Partners.
 
ONEOK believes the non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies in its industry as a measurement of financial performance of ONEOK Partners and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate the financial performance of the partnership and to compare the financial performance of the partnership with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships within its industry.
 
ONEOK Partners EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, earnings per unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, this non-GAAP measure should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that is available for distributions or that is planned to be distributed for a given period nor does it equate to available cash as defined in the ONEOK Partners partnership agreement.
 
ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) is a diversified energy company.  We are the general partner and own 43.4 percent of ONEOK Partners, L.P.
