ONEOK Repurchases $150 Million of Common Stock
 
 
TULSA, Okla.  June 12, 2012  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced that it has entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
 
Under terms of the accelerated repurchase agreement, ONEOK immediately repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares from Goldman, Sachs & Co. based on yesterdays closing stock price of $41.19 per share, of which 80 percent of the shares will be received immediately.  Goldman, Sachs & Co. borrowed the shares sold to ONEOK and will purchase shares in the open market to settle its borrowings.
 
The repurchase agreement provides for an adjustment based on the volume-weighted average price, less a discount, of the shares over the course of a repurchase period that expires on or before the end of 2012.
 
 This second repurchase of shares under our previously announced stock repurchase program is a continuation of our ongoing commitment to increase value for our shareholders and deliver attractive returns on their investment, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman and chief executive officer.
 
The accelerated share repurchase was funded by the companys available cash and short-term borrowings.
 
The accelerated repurchase was completed under the companys previously announced three-year stock repurchase program in which the companys board of directors authorized the company to buy up to $750 million of the companys issued and outstanding common stock, subject to the limitation that purchases will not exceed $300 million in any one calendar year. The repurchase program will terminate upon completion of the repurchase of $750 million of common stock or on Dec. 31, 2013, whichever occurs first.
 
In August 2011, the company completed a $300 million accelerated share-repurchase agreement under the program.
