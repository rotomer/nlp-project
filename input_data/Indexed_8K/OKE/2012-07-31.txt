Exhibit 99.1
 
TULSA, Okla.  July 31, 2012  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced second-quarter 2012 earnings of 29 cents per diluted share, compared with 25 cents per diluted share on a split-adjusted basis for the same period last year.  Second-quarter net income attributable to ONEOK was $61.0 million, compared with $55.1 million for the same period in 2011.
Net income attributable to ONEOK for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, was $183.9 million, or 87 cents per diluted share, compared with $185.3 million, or 85 cents per diluted share on a split-adjusted basis for the same period last year.
 
ONEOK updated its 2012 net income guidance range to $345 million to $375 million, compared with the previous range of $360 million to $410 million. The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the energy services and natural gas distribution segments, offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment.
 
Our ONEOK Partners segment posted strong second-quarter results, benefiting from continued favorable natural gas liquids price differentials, increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered, and higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed, as a result of recently completed growth projects, said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman and chief executive officer.
Our natural gas distribution segment delivered solid results, while our energy services segment continues to operate in a challenging marketing environment, Gibson said.
 
ONEOKs second-quarter 2012 operating income was $234.1 million, compared with $216.2 million for the second quarter 2011.
Second-quarter 2012 results benefited from solid performance in the ONEOK Partners segment including higher natural gas liquids (NGL) optimization margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities, and higher NGL volumes gathered in the natural gas liquids business; and higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed, offset partially by lower natural gas and NGL product prices in the natural gas gathering and processing business.

Second-quarter 2012 results for the natural gas distribution segment were slightly higher due primarily to higher rates and surcharge recoveries in Texas and Kansas, offset partially by higher depreciation expense due to increased capital expenditures.
The energy services segment had lower second-quarter 2012 results due primarily to lower transportation and premium-services margins.
 
Year-to-date 2012 operating income was $560.0 million, compared with $544.5 million for the same period last year.
 
The increase in year-to-date 2012 results was driven primarily by higher NGL optimization and exchange margins resulting from favorable NGL price differentials and increased NGL fractionation and transportation capacity available for optimization activities; higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated in the natural gas liquids business; and higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed, offset partially by lower natural gas prices and NGL product prices in the ONEOK Partners segment.
These increases were offset by lower margins in the energy services segment due primarily to lower storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, including a required $29.9 million reclassification of losses on certain financial contracts and a $10.3 million non-recurring goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter 2012, and lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities.
Operating costs for the second quarter 2012 were $231.3 million, compared with $223.6 million in the same period last year.  Operating costs for the six-month 2012 period were $455.3 million, compared with $445.3 million in the same period last year.  The increases for both the three- and six-month 2012 periods were due primarily to the ONEOK Partners segments expanding operations as a result of several internal growth projects that were placed in service and scheduled maintenance costs.
In February 2012, ONEOK sold its retail natural gas marketing business, which was accounted for in the natural gas distribution segment, to Constellation Energy Group, Inc. for $32.9 million, including working capital, and recognized an after-tax gain of $13.5 million.  Financial information for this business is reflected as discontinued operations.

Natural Gas Distribution
Prior reporting periods for the natural gas distribution segment have been recast to exclude retail marketing operations that were sold in February 2012. Those operations are now reflected as discontinued operations.
The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $21.7 million in the second quarter 2012, compared with $20.2 million in the second quarter 2011.
 
Second-quarter results reflect higher rates and surcharge recoveries in Texas and Kansas offset by higher depreciation expense from increased capital expenditures, including investments in automated meter-reading devices in Oklahoma.
 
For the six months 2012, operating income was $120.6 million, compared with $123.3 million in the same period in 2011.
 
Six-month 2012 results reflect higher depreciation expense from increased capital expenditures, including investments in automated meter-reading devices in Oklahoma; and a decrease in transportation margins in Kansas and Oklahoma due to warmer-than-normal weather in the first quarter 2012 that reduced commercial customer demand that is not subject to weather normalization, offset partially by higher rates and surcharge recoveries in Texas and Kansas.
 
Second-quarter 2012 operating costs were $103.8 million, compared with $104.5 million in the second quarter 2011.  Six-month 2012 operating costs were $208.7 million, compared with $209.2 million in the same period a year earlier.  The decreases for both the three- and six-month 2012 periods were due primarily to lower share-based compensation costs offset partially by higher outside services, legal expenses and pension costs.

2012 EARNINGS GUIDANCE UPDATED
 
ONEOKs 2012 net income is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $375 million, compared with its previously announced range of $360 million to $410 million.  The updated guidance reflects lower expected earnings in the energy services and natural gas distribution segments offset partially by higher expected earnings in the ONEOK Partners segment.  Additional information is available in the on the ONEOK website.
guidance tables
 
The midpoint of ONEOKs 2012 operating income guidance decreased to $1.104 billion, compared with its previous guidance midpoint of $1.132 billion. The midpoint for ONEOKs 2012 net income guidance is $360 million, compared with its previous guidance of $385 million.
 
The midpoint of the ONEOK Partners segments 2012 operating income guidance increased to $948 million, compared with its previous guidance of $910 million.  The updated 2012 guidance reflects higher expected earnings in the natural gas liquids business and lower expected earnings in the natural gas gathering and processing business.
 
The average unhedged prices assumed for the second half of 2012 at ONEOK Partners are $85.42 per barrel for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil, $2.88 per MMBtu for NYMEX natural gas and $0.71 per gallon for composite natural gas liquids.  Previous guidance released on May 23, 2012, assumed $97.75 per barrel for NYMEX crude oil,

$3.30 per MMBtu for NYMEX natural gas and $1.20 per gallon for composite natural gas liquids.
Currently, ONEOK Partners estimates that in its natural gas gathering and processing business, a 1-cent-per-gallon change in the composite price of NGLs would change annual net margin by approximately $2.5 million. A $1.00-per-barrel change in the price of crude oil would change annual net margin by approximately $1.3 million.  Also, a 10-cent-per-MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change annual net margin by approximately $2.3 million.  All of these sensitivities exclude the effects of hedging and assume normal operating conditions.
Additionally, ONEOK Partners estimates that in the natural gas liquids business, the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu OPIS average ethane in ethane/propane mix price differential is expected to be 28 cents for the second half of 2012, compared with its previous full-year 2012 guidance of 32 cents.
The midpoint of the natural gas distribution segments 2012 operating income guidance has been updated to $215 million, compared with its previous guidance of $223 million, reflecting lower margins due to warmer than normal weather.
The midpoint of the energy services segments 2012 operating income guidance has been updated to a loss of $60 million, compared with its previous guidance of $0 million.  Updated 2012 guidance reflects the $29.9 million required reclassification of losses on certain financial contracts and the $10.3 million non-recurring goodwill impairment charge, both occurring in the first quarter 2012.  This segment also expects lower transportation and premium-services margins in 2012.  Additional information on the energy services segments revised guidance is available in the on the ONEOK website.
guidance tables
Capital expenditures for 2012 are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion, comprised of approximately $2.0 billion at ONEOK Partners and $304 million on a stand-alone basis.
On a stand-alone basis, the midpoint of ONEOKs 2012 guidance for cash flow before changes in working capital has been updated to $695 million, compared with its previous guidance of $740 million.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance.  Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation, amortization and impairments, deferred income taxes, and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities.  ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income.  Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.  A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
