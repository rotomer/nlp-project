Exhibit 99.1
ONEOK Announces Higher 2013 Financial Guidance
2013 Net Income Expected to Increase 19 Percent
Three-year Financial Forecasts Updated
TULSA, Okla. - Sept. 24, 2012 - ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced that its 2013 net income is expected to increase 19 percent compared with its current 2012 earnings guidance that was updated on July 31, 2012.
ONEOK's 2013 net income is expected to be in the range of $405 million to $455 million compared with its current 2012 guidance range of $345 million to $375 million, reflecting higher anticipated earnings in the ONEOK Partners (NYSE: OKS), natural gas distribution and energy services segments.
Our 2013 guidance reflects projects that will be placed into service later this year and in 2013 from ONEOK Partners' previously announced $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion, four-year growth program. The expected 2013 earnings growth will come from higher projected volumes, not from higher projected commodity prices or wider projected price differentials, in our ONEOK Partners segment, said John W. Gibson, chairman and chief executive officer of ONEOK.
Expected increased distributions from ONEOK Partners will enhance ONEOK's continued strong cash flow and enable us to deliver sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders, including increased dividends.
The 2013 guidance also includes a projected dividend increase of 3 cents per share semiannually in 2013, subject to ONEOK board approval.
2013 earnings guidance reflects increased operating income in the ONEOK Partners segment due to higher anticipated earnings from increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes and higher natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes gathered and fractionated resulting from the completion of several internal growth projects; and higher margins from increases in rates and surcharges in the natural gas distribution segment. These increases are expected to be offset partially by lower NGL optimization margins resulting from lower expected optimization

volumes and narrower expected NGL price differentials in ONEOK Partners' natural gas liquids business.
The midpoint of ONEOK's 2013 operating income guidance is approximately $1.2 billion. Additional information is available in Exhibit A in the
guidance tables
on the ONEOK website.
ONEOK expects to increase its net income by 20 to 25 percent annually between 2012 and 2015, compared with 2012 earnings guidance, driven primarily by incremental earnings to ONEOK from the growth at ONEOK Partners.
ONEOK also expects to increase its total dividend by approximately 65 to 70 percent between 2012 and 2015, which includes the planned 2013 dividend increases.
ONEOK's 2013 earnings guidance also includes a projected 2-cent-per-unit-per-quarter increase in unitholder distributions declared from ONEOK Partners, subject to ONEOK Partners board approval.
ONEOK PARTNERS SEGMENT
The midpoint of the ONEOK Partners segment's 2013 operating income guidance is $1.027 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared with current 2012 guidance. This increase reflects higher anticipated earnings from increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes in the natural gas gathering and processing business and higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated in the natural gas liquids business. These increases are expected to be offset partially by expected lower NGL optimization margins resulting from lower expected optimization volumes and narrower expected NGL price differentials in the natural gas liquids business.
Approximately 80 percent of the partnership's expected 2013 equity natural gas production is hedged at an average price of $3.85 per million British thermal units (MMBtu); 2 percent of its expected 2013 equity natural gas liquids production is hedged at an average price of $2.51 per gallon; and 70 percent of its expected 2013 equity condensate production is hedged at an average price of $102.25 per barrel.
The average unhedged prices used in ONEOK Partners' 2013 earnings guidance are $95.30 per barrel for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil; $4.05 per MMBtu for NYMEX natural gas; and 76 cents per gallon for composite natural gas liquids.
For 2013, the partnership estimates that in its natural gas gathering and processing business, a 1-cent per gallon change in the composite price of NGLs would change annual net margin by approximately $3.2 million; a $1.00 per barrel change in the price of crude oil would

change annual net margin by approximately $1.3 million; and a 10-cent per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change annual net margin by approximately $2.3 million. All of these sensitivities exclude the effects of hedging and assume normal operating conditions.
Additionally, ONEOK Partners estimates that in the natural gas liquids business, the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu OPIS average ethane in ethane/propane mix price differential is expected to be 19 cents per gallon for 2013, compared with its current 2012 guidance of 28 cents per gallon for the second half of 2012.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT
The midpoint of the natural gas distribution segment's 2013 operating income guidance is $227 million, an increase of 6 percent compared with current 2012 guidance, reflecting higher 2013 expected margins from increases in rates and surcharges.
ENERGY SERVICES SEGMENT
The midpoint of the energy services segment's 2013 operating income guidance is a loss of $20 million, reflecting higher storage and transportation margins compared with current 2012 guidance.
The energy services segment continues to execute its strategy of realigning its leased natural gas storage and transportation capacity, through renewals and renegotiations, with the needs of its premium-services customers and reducing operating expenses. Year-end 2013 leased storage capacity is expected to be approximately 65 billion cubic feet (Bcf) compared with approximately 72 Bcf at year-end 2012. Year-end 2013 long-term leased transportation capacity is expected to be 0.8 Bcf per day compared with 1.0 Bcf per day at year-end 2012.
OTHER INCOME
2013 other income is estimated to be higher than 2012 due to an expected increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction in the ONEOK Partners segment as a result of the previously announced growth projects of approximately $5.7 billion to $6.6 billion between 2011 and 2015.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
For 2013, ONEOK's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $317 million on a stand-alone basis. The natural gas distribution segment's planned capital expenditures of $286 million reflect increased investments related primarily to asset-integrity management and projects that are expected to reduce operating and maintenance expenses.

STAND-ALONE CASH FLOW
On a stand-alone basis, the midpoint of ONEOK's 2013 guidance for cash flow before changes in working capital is $785 million. Cash flow before changes in working capital is expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends by $140 million to $180 million. Additional information is available in Exhibit B in the
guidance tables
on the ONEOK website.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the company's financial performance. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOK's stand-alone depreciation, amortization and impairments, deferred income taxes, and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as an indicator of financial performance of the company's fundamental business activities. ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of

other companies. A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the guidance tables.
