Exhibit 99.1
ONEOK Announces Higher Third-quarter 2012 Financial Results;
Affirms 2012 Earnings Guidance Range
TULSA, Okla.  Oct. 30, 2012  ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) today announced third-quarter 2012 earnings of 31 cents per diluted share, compared with 28 cents per diluted share on a split-adjusted basis for the same period last year. Third-quarter net income attributable to ONEOK was $65.2 million, compared with $60.3 million for the same period in 2011.
Net income attributable to ONEOK for the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2012, was $249.1 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared with $245.6 million, or $1.14 per diluted share on a split-adjusted basis for the same period last year.
 
ONEOK affirmed its 2012 net income guidance range of $345 million to $375 million.
 
Our ONEOK Partners segment continued to perform well in the third quarter as a result of completed growth projects, which provided increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed and natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated said John W. Gibson, ONEOK chairman and chief executive officer.
Our natural gas distribution segment delivered expected results in the third quarter, while our energy services segment continues to face a challenging market environment, Gibson said.
ONEOKs third-quarter 2012 operating income was $242.9 million, compared with $249.3 million for the third quarter 2011.
Third-quarter 2012 results benefited from solid performance in the ONEOK Partners segment, including higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in the natural gas gathering and processing business offset by lower realized natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) product prices, particularly ethane and propane. The natural gas liquids business benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated, offset partially by decreased optimization and marketing margins resulting from narrower NGL price differentials and lower NGL transportation capacity available for optimization activities.

Third-quarter 2012 results for the natural gas distribution segment were down due primarily to higher share-based compensation costs offset partially by an increase in margins from new rates.
The energy services segment had lower third-quarter 2012 results due primarily to lower transportation and premium-services margins.
 
Year-to-date 2012 operating income was $802.9 million, compared with $793.9 million for the same period last year.
 
The increase in year-to-date 2012 results was driven primarily by higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed in ONEOK Partners natural gas gathering and processing business offset by lower realized natural gas and NGL product prices. ONEOK Partners natural gas liquids business benefited from higher NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and higher optimization and marketing margins from favorable NGL price differentials.
These nine-month 2012 increases were offset by lower margins in the energy services segment due primarily to lower storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities, including a required $29.9 million reclassification of losses on certain financial contracts and a $10.3 million non-recurring goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter 2012, lower transportation margins, net of hedging activities, and lower premium-services margins.
Operating costs for the third quarter 2012 were $229.2 million, compared with $207.3 million in the same period last year. Operating costs for the nine-month 2012 period were $684.5 million, compared with $652.6 million in the same period last year. The increases for both the three- and nine-month 2012 periods were due primarily to the ONEOK Partners segments expanding operations as a result of several internal growth-projects that were placed in service and scheduled maintenance costs.
In February 2012, ONEOK sold its retail natural gas marketing business, which was accounted for in the natural gas distribution segment, to Constellation Energy Group, Inc. for $32.9 million, including working capital, and recognized an after-tax gain of $13.5 million. Financial information for this business is reflected as discontinued operations.
Interest expense was $71.4 million in the third quarter 2012, compared with $73.8 million in the same period last year. Nine-month 2012 interest expense was $218.7 million, compared with $228.7 million in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by higher capitalized interest as a result of increased investments in growth projects in the ONEOK Partners segment.

price differentials and lower transportation capacity available for optimization activities, as an increasing portion of its transportation capacity between the Conway, Kan., and Mont Belvieu, Texas, NGL market centers is utilized by the partnerships exchange services activities to produce fee-based earnings. This decrease was offset partially by a $22.5 million increase in its marketing activities due primarily to margins realized on the fractionation and sale of NGL inventory held at the end of the second quarter of 2012 associated with the scheduled maintenance at the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation facility;
For the first nine months 2012, the ONEOK Partners segment posted operating income of $732.5 million, compared with $622.0 million in the same period a year earlier.
Nine-month 2012 results, compared with the same period last year, reflect:

Third-quarter 2012 operating costs were $121.1 million, compared with $106.3 million in the third quarter 2011. Nine-month 2012 operating costs were $360.4 million, compared with $328.6 million in the same period a year earlier.
The increases for both the three- and nine-month 2012 periods were due primarily to increased expenses for materials, supplies and outside services associated with scheduled maintenance; and increased employee-related costs associated with the growth of ONEOK Partners operations and completed projects in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.

Natural Gas Distribution

The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $15.7 million in the third quarter 2012, compared with $19.8 million in the third quarter 2011.
Third-quarter results reflect higher share-based compensation costs offset partially by higher rates.
For the nine months 2012, operating income was $136.2 million, compared with $143.1 million in the same period in 2011.

Nine-month 2012 results reflect higher depreciation expense from increased capital expenditures; and a decrease in transportation margins in Kansas and Oklahoma due to warmer-than-normal weather in the first quarter 2012 that reduced commercial customer demand that is not subject to weather normalization, offset partially by higher rates.
Third-quarter 2012 operating costs were $103.4 million, compared with $95.3 million in the third quarter 2011. Third quarter results reflect a $7.0 million increase in share-based compensation costs from appreciation in ONEOKs share price and a $1.0 million increase in pension costs.
Nine-month 2012 operating costs were $312.1 million, compared with $304.6 million in the same period a year earlier. This increase was due primarily to higher outside services, legal and pension costs; offset partially by lower share-based compensation costs in the nine-month 2012 period compared with the same period in 2011 due to common stock awarded to employees as part of ONEOKs stock award program and the appreciation in ONEOKs share price during 2011.
Key Statistics: More detailed information is listed on page 18 of the tables.

The energy services segment reported a third-quarter 2012 operating loss of $21.8 million, compared with an operating loss of $12.7 million in the same period in 2011.

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE:
ONEOK has disclosed in this news release stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is used as a measure of the companys financial performance. Stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions received from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOKs stand-alone depreciation, amortization and impairments, deferred income taxes, and certain other items.
The non-GAAP financial measure described above is useful to investors because the measurement is used as a measurement of financial performance of the companys fundamental business activities. ONEOK stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of stand-alone cash flow, before changes in working capital, to net income is included in the financial tables.
