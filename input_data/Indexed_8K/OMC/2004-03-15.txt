EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description of Documents - ------- ------------------------ 99.1 Supplemental Financial Information dated March 15, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Supplemental Financial Information Overview In accordance with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - - Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123", we have elected, effective January 1, 2004, to account for employee stock compensation using the fair value method. As a result, the fair value of stock-based employee compensation, including unvested employee stock options issued and outstanding, will be recorded as an expense in our statement of income beginning January 1, 2004. Our 2004 results will reflect an expense for employee stock compensation that is consistent with the application of the modified prospective approach as set forth in SFAS 148. Additionally, we will retrospectively apply the adoption of the fair value method to all stock compensation, including unvested employee stock options issued and outstanding from the beginning of the earliest period presented, referred to as the retroactive restatement approach. Accordingly, we will restate our historical results for the comparable fiscal quarters of 2003 at the time that we issue our unaudited quarterly financial statements for each fiscal quarter in 2004, as well as restate our historical results for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 at the time we issue our audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, in each case as if we used the fair value method beginning January 1, 2002. The financial information below shows the effect of the adoption of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, on our historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and for each of our fiscal quarters in 2003, as if we had used the fair value method beginning January 1, 2002. It also presents a reconciliation of the selected financial data previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the quarterly financial information reported for each of the quarters ended in 2003, to the restated data. This information is in addition to, and supplements, the information otherwise included in those reports.
