In accordance with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", as amended by SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment for FASB Statement No. 123", we elected, effective January 1, 2004, to account for stock-based employee compensation using the fair value method. As a result, the fair value of stock-based employee compensation, including unvested employee stock options issued and outstanding, were recorded as an expense utilizing the retroactive restatement method as set forth in SFAS 148. Accordingly, our results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 have been restated as if we used the fair value method to account for stock-based compensation.
