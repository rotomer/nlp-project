2005 Total Revenue Growth
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

(a)
The After-Tax Free Cash Flow numbers presented above are a non-GAAP measure. They exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities.  This presentation reflects the metrics used by management to assess our generation of cash.  We believe that this presentation is more meaningful for understanding our after-tax free cash flow and our primary uses of that cash flow.  This presentation was derived from our GAAP condensed statement of cash flow on the previous page of this presentation.
(b)
Reflects cashtax differences arising from our convertible bonds and tax deductible goodwill.  These amounts are included in "Other changes in Working Capital" on the previous page of this presentation.
(c)
Net of proceeds of $29.3 million in 2005 from the sale of businesses.

Stock repurchases of $731.8 million and $446.5 million are net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold in our employee stock purchase plan of $88.1 million and $74.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
