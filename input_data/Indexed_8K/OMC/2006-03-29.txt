Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
        On March 29, 2006, Omnicom Group Inc., together with its wholly owned direct finance subsidiaries, Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance Inc. (collectively, the "Issuers"), closed its sale of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.90% notes due 2016 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 24, 2006, among the Issuers and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative of the several underwriters names therein. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-132625) previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act.
        The net proceeds received by the Issuers, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Issuers, were $987.7 million. The Issuers intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancing of other debt or other capital transactions. The precise amounts and timing of the application of proceeds will depend upon the funding requirements of Omnicom Group Inc. and its subsidiaries at the time of issuance and the availability of other funds. The Notes are the joint and several unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Omnicom Group Inc. and rank equal in right of payment to all of their respective existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Indenture, defined below, does not contain any provision that would limit the Issuer's ability to incur indebtedness or that would afford holders of Notes protection in the event of a sudden and significant decline in the credit quality or rating of Omnicom Group Inc. or a takeover, recapitalization or highly leveraged or similar transactions involving Omnicom Group Inc.
        The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2006, between the Issuers and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2006, between the Issuers and the Trustee (as so amended, the "Indenture"). The Notes will bear interest from March 29. 2006 at a rate equal to 5.90% per year, payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2006. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding April 1 and October 1, respectively.
        The Indenture contains covenants limiting the Issuers' ability and their subsidiaries' ability to, with certain exceptions (i) create certain liens; and (ii) consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all their assets to, another person.
        The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default generally means that the Issuers (1) fail to pay the principal on a Note on its due date, (2) do not pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3) remains in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after its receipt of written notice of such failure or (4) file for bankruptcy or certain other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs.
        The Issuers have the right to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes that would be due after the redemption date discounted to the date of redemption, plus a make whole spread equal to 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as applicable.
        The Underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future commercial banking, derivatives and/or investment banking transactions with the Issuers and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received, or will receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is one of the lead arrangers and book managers of the Issuers' credit facilities. Certain of the other underwriters are also participants in the Issuers' credit facilities.
        The forgoing description of the issuance, sale and terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture entered into in connection therewith. The Underwriting Agreement and the Supplemental Indenture are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1 and 4.2 and the Indenture is incorporated herein by reference.

the Company of its obligations hereunder. The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective property or assets is the subject which are not described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(u) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary or required for the performance by the Issuers of their obligations hereunder, in connection with the offering, issuance or sale of the Securities hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for the due execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Indenture by the Issuers, except (i) such as have been already obtained, (ii) such as may be required by the securities or blue sky laws of the various states in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated herein and in the Final Prospectus.

(w) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all real property owned by the Company and such Subsidiary and good title to all other 7

(ee) No holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement.

(c) If, at any time prior to the filing of a final prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (d) If, at any time when the Final Prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus, as then supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

(h) The Issuers agree that, unless they have obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Issuers that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Issuers with the Commission or retained by the Issuers under Rule 433; other than the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III and Schedule V hereto.

(i) The Issuers will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Issuers or any affiliate of the Issuers or any person in privity with the Issuers or any affiliate of the Issuers) directly or indirectly, including the 12
filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto. (j) The Issuers will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. 6.

(g) The Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and stating in effect that: (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; 14
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and audit committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to December 31, 2005, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) with respect to the period subsequent to December 31, 2005, there were any changes, at March 22, 2006, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from January 1, 2006 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year; in revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; (2) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; or (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 1A, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7A and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. 15

(i) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and Subject to Section 11 hereof all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 20022, on the Closing Date. 7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Issuers to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 16
8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Issuers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Issuers will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, each of their directors, each of their officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Issuers acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting," (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify 17
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Issuers and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Issuers and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible 18
for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Issuers and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Issuers shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Issuers on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Issuers within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Issuers who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Issuers shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuers, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Issuers. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the 19
Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Issuers and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal, New York State or Delaware State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Issuers or their officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Issuers or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices.

No Fiduciary Duty. The Issuers hereby acknowledge that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Issuers and (c) the Issuers' engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in 20
any other capacity. Furthermore, the Issuers agree that they are solely responsible for making their own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Issuers on related or other matters). The Issuers agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Issuers, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 15. Integration. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Issuers and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 16. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 17.

"GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles set forth in the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the opinions and pronouncements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in the statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or in such other statements by such other entity as have been approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession, which are in effect from time to time.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding that redemption date. "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities that would be due after the related redemption date but for that redemption.

ARTICLE FIVE COMPANY GUARANTEE 5. Company Guarantee. 5.1. The Company hereby, jointly and severally with any other Person who may also guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations (as defined below), unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees (the "Guarantee"), on a senior unsecured basis, as a primary obligor and not as a surety, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, the full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, of the principal of and interest on, if any, the Securities, if lawful, and all other monetary obligations of each of OCI and OFI under the Indenture (as so amended by this Supplemental Indenture) and the Securities (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Company further agrees, in its capacity as a guarantor, that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from the Company, and the Company shall remain bound under its Guarantee and the Indenture, as amended hereby, notwithstanding any such extension or renewal. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Company will be obligated to pay the same in full, or cause to be duly and punctually paid in full, without any demand or notice whatsoever. 5.2. In its capacity as guarantor, the Company hereby waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to OCI or OFI, as the case may be, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. In its capacity as guarantor, the Company also hereby waives notice of any default by OCI or OFI, as the case may be, under the Securities or the Indenture. The Company agrees that its obligations under its Guarantee shall be continuing, absolute, full and unconditional under any and all circumstances, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and shall not be discharged except by payment in full of the Securities, irrespective of: (a) the value, genuineness, regularity, validity, enforceability, avoidance, subordination, discharge or disaffirmance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Securities or the Indenture, or the absence of any action to enforce the same; (b) any extension or waiver, at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Company, of the time for compliance by OCI or OFI, as the case may be, with any of its obligations under the Securities or the Indenture; (c) any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any obligations of OCI or OFI, as the case may be, under the Securities or the Indenture; (d) any rescission, amendment or modification to any of the terms or provisions of the Securities or the Indenture; 7
(e) any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction affecting any term of any of the Securities or the Indenture or the rights of any Holder or the Trustee with respect thereto; (f) any failure to obtain any authorization or approval from, or other action by, to notify, or to file anything with, any governmental authority or regulatory body required in connection with the performance of the Guarantee by the Company; (g) the failure by any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to exercise any right or remedy against OCI or OFI, as the case may be, or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person; (h) the failure by any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (i) any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a defense to or a legal or equitable discharge of the Company's obligations, in its capacity as guarantor, under its Guarantee or of the Company's obligations, in its capacity as guarantor, under the Securities and the Indenture. 5.3. The Company's obligations under its Guarantee and the Indenture, as amended by this Supplemental Indenture, and the Securities, in each case in its capacity as guarantor, shall not be limited by any valuation, estimation or disallowance made in connection with any proceedings filed by or against the Company or the Company under the United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended (the "Bankruptcy Code"), whether pursuant to Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other section thereof. The Company further agrees that, in its capacity as guarantor, none of the Holders shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of or against or in payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Securities. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments on any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or payments (or any part thereof) is or are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to the Company, its estate, trustee or receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, the Company, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Guaranteed Obligations (or, if applicable, such part thereof as had been paid, reduced or satisfied by such amount), shall be reinstated and revived and continued in full force and effect as of the date such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction occurred. The Company waives, in its capacity as guarantor, all set-offs, counterclaims, reductions and diminutions of any obligation, and any defense of any kind or nature (other than, payment of the Guaranteed Obligations), that the Company may have or assert against OCI, OFI or any other Person, and all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of acceptance of its Guarantee. 5.4. The Company, in its capacity as guarantor, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any Holder that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the 8
Company or other rights of the Company to proceed against OCI, OFI, any other guarantor or any other Person or collateral, if any, and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or the Securities of the Company under the Indenture, the Securities or this Supplemental Indenture. 5.5. The Company, in its capacity as guarantor, hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have its obligations under the Guarantee and the Indenture divided among it and other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, if any, such that the Company's obligations would be less than the full amount claimed. The Company, in its capacity as guarantor, hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to have the assets of OCI, OFI or any other Person who became an "obligor" under the Securities or the Indenture first be used and depleted as payment of the obligations of OCI, OFI or such other Person, respectively, under the Securities and the Indenture prior to any amounts being claimed from or paid by the Company under its Guarantee. The Company, in its capacity as guarantor, hereby waives any right to which it may be entitled to require that suit be instituted against OCI, OFI or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or "obligor" under the Securities or the Indenture prior to an action being initiated against the Company. The Company further agrees that the Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right, in its capacity as guarantor, to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. 5.6. The failure to endorse the Guarantee on any Security shall not affect or impair the validity thereof. 5.7. The Company's obligations under its Guarantee shall not be affected if any Holder is precluded for any reason (including, without limitation, the application of the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code) from enforcing or exercising any right or remedy with respect to the Securities, and the Company shall pay to each affected Holder, upon demand, the amount that would otherwise have been due and payable had the exercise of such rights and remedies been permitted. In the event of any such application of the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Securities shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes of the Guarantee. 5.8. The Company hereby agrees that, unless and until all obligations with respect to the Securities and the Indenture, as amended by this Supplemental Indenture, have been paid in full, in its capacity as guarantor, it shall have no right (whether direct or indirect) of subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) to the claims of any Holder or the Trustee against OCI, OFI or any other Person who became an "obligor" under the Securities or the Indenture in respect of any obligation with respect to the Securities or the Indenture, notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Company hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of the Company by the Holder; and the Company hereby waives all contractual, statutory and common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity it may have against OCI, OFI or any other such Person as the case may be, and any and all other rights of payment or recovery from OCI, OFI or any other such Person, as the case may be, that it may now have or hereafter acquire until all Securities and all obligations under the Indenture have been paid in full (in which event such rights of payment or recovery shall be deemed to be in the form of a loan or loans made from the Company to OCI, OFI or any other such Person, as 9
the case may be). The Company further agrees that, in its capacity as guarantor, as between the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the Securities guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of the Company's Guarantee hereunder, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Securities guaranteed pursuant to this Section 5, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Securities as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such Securities (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Company for the purpose of its Guarantee hereunder. 5.9. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 5.12 of this Supplemental Indenture with respect to the release of the Company from its Guarantee hereunder, such Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Company and the successors thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of (and be enforceable by) the Trustee and the Holders from time to time, or their respective successors or assignees, until the Indenture shall have been terminated and the principal of and interest, if any, on the Securities, and the obligations of the Company in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, have been satisfied by payment in full. 5.10. Payments made by the Company pursuant to its Guarantee hereunder will be made to each Holder in the same manner, and to the same location, as payments to such Holder are required to be made pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture. 5.11. The Company shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in connection with the enforcement of the Guarantee or any other rights of the Trustee or such Holder under this Supplemental Indenture with respect to such Guarantee and the prosecution or defense of any action by or against any of the Holders in connection with the Guarantee or this Supplemental Indenture with respect to such Guarantee, whether involving the Company or any other Person, including a trustee in bankruptcy; provided, however, that the Company shall have no such obligation in connection with any action brought by any Holder against the Company to the extent that the Company is the prevailing party in the judgment rendered in any such action; and provided further that the Company shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of attorneys (in addition to any required local counsel). 5.12. The Company may, by execution and delivery to the Trustee of a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee, be released from its Guarantee upon the sale or other transfer of its capital stock or of all or substantially all of its assets to an entity that is not the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and which sale is otherwise in compliance with the Indenture, which release shall be effective without any action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Upon any such release, the Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request by the Company or the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying as to compliance with this Section 5.12. Any actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall not release the Company, OCI or OFI as a primary obligor under the Indenture or the Securities. ARTICLE SIX LIABILITY OF TRUSTEE 10

Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication. The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the following form: This is one of the Securities of the Series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As Trustee By _________________________________ Authorized Officer
Reverse of Security. OMNICOM GROUP INC. OMNICOM CAPITAL INC. OMNICOM FINANCE INC. 5.90% Senior Notes due 2016 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Issuers, designated as their 5.90% Senior Notes due 2016 (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more Series under an Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Issuers and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuers, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000. Capitalized terms used in this Security and not defined herein have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Indenture. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture has been appointed by the Issuers as paying agent, Securities registrar, with regard to the Securities. In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of and accrued interest on all Securities may be declared, and upon said declaration, shall become due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided for in the Indenture. The Securities will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Issuers' option, at any time or from time to time, upon mailed notice to the registered address of each Holder of Securities at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Securities discounted to the date of redemption, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and any two other primary U.S. Government securities dealer selected by the Issuers and their respective successors. A-5
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding that redemption date. "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Securities that would be due after the related redemption date but for that redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to the Securities, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Securities will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Securities to such redemption date. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, the Issuers will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that redemption date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this Series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Indenture contains provisions that permit the Issuers to elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from the entire indebtedness of this Security or (2) to be released from their obligations under certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon payment in full of the Securities and compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this Series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this Series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuers and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each Series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuers and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding of each Series to be affected, with certain exceptions as therein provided with respect to certain modifications or amendments which may not be made without the consent of each Holder of such Security affected thereby. The Indenture also permits certain amendments and modifications thereto from time to A-6
time by the Issuers and the Trustee without the consent of the Holders of any Series of the Securities to be affected thereby for certain specified purposes, including curing ambiguities, defects or inconsistencies and making any such change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of such series of the Securities, as provided therein. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such Series, to waive compliance by the Issuers with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuers, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and Interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the security register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuers in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuers and the security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this Series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this Series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this Series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Issuers, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuers or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Issuers, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuers or of any successor A-7
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. A-8
