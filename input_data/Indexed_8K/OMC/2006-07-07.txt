The Company initially issued the Securities under an Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, dated as of June 10, 2003, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 5, 2003, among the Issuers and the Trustee, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 4, 2004, among the Issuers and the Trustee, and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 4, 2004 and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of the date hereof; among the Issuers and the Trustee (as so amended, the "Indenture").

On or after June 15, 2023, if the June 15, 2023 Average Conversion Value of a Security is greater than the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity but less than or equal to 220% of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity, then the Principal Amount at Maturity of a Security will be equal to the June 15, 2023 Average Conversion Value of the Security; provided that if the June 15, 2023 Average Conversion Value exceeds 200% of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity, then the Principal Amount at Maturity will equal 200% of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity. If the June 15, 2023 Average Conversion Value exceeds 220% of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity or is less than or equal than the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity then the Principal Amount at Maturity will equal the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity. 5. Contingent Cash Interest.

The Issuers will determine every six months, commencing June 15, 2010, whether the conditions to the payment of Contingent Cash Interest have been satisfied and, if so, the Issuers shall promptly notify the Holders of this Security of such determination and shall use their reasonable best efforts to post this information on their web site or, at their option, otherwise publicly disclose this information. 6. Redemption at the Option of the Issuers. No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Issuers cannot redeem the Securities before June 15, 2010, except upon a Change in Control as described in paragraph 7 hereof. On or after June 15, 2010, and before June 15, 2023 the Issuers may, at its option, redeem the Securities for cash at any time in whole or from time to time in part at the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities. On or after June 15, 2023, the Issuers may redeem the Securities at any time in whole or in part at the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity plus accrued Contingent Additional Principal, if any. The price to be paid for any such redemption is referred to as the "Redemption Price." The Securities will be redeemable in integral multiples of $1,000 of Principal Amount at Maturity. In addition to the Redemption Price payable with respect to all Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed as of a Redemption Date, the Holders of such Securities (or portions thereof) shall be entitled to receive accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, with respect thereto, which Contingent Cash Interest shall be paid in cash on the Redemption Date. 7. Purchase by the Issuers at the Option of the Holder. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Issuers shall become obligated to purchase, at the option of the Holder, the Securities held by such Holder on the following Purchase Dates and at the following Purchase Prices per $1,000 Initial Principal Amount at Maturity, upon delivery of a Purchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to -11-
such Purchase Date until the close of business on the Purchase Date and upon delivery of the Securities to the Paying Agent by the Holder as set forth in the Indenture. Purchase Date Purchase Price ------------- -------------- June 15, 2006, 2010, Initial Principal Amount at Maturity 2013, and 2018 of the Security June 15, 2023 through Initial Principal Amount at Maturity June 15, 2037 of the Security plus accrued Contingent Additional Principal, if any The Purchase Price shall be paid in cash and shall be paid by a Purchase Party if so designated by the Issuers, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Issuers shall become obligated to purchase the Securities held by such Holder 35 Business Days after the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Issuers occurring on or prior to June 15, 2010 for a Change in Control Purchase Price equal to $1,000 per Security, which Change in Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash. If at least 90% in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control are purchased on the Change in Control Purchase Date, the Issuers may, within 90 days following the Change in Control Purchase Date, at their option, redeem for cash all of the remaining Securities at a Redemption Price per Security equal to the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of such Security. In addition to the Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, payable with respect to all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Purchase Date or the Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, the Holders of such Securities (or portions thereof) shall be entitled to receive accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, with respect thereto, which Contingent Cash Interest shall be paid in cash promptly following the later of the Purchase Date or the Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be and the time of delivery of such Securities to the Paying Agent pursuant to the Indenture. Holders have the right to withdraw any Purchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. If cash (and/or securities if permitted under the Indenture) sufficient to pay the Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of, together with any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest with respect to, all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Purchase Date or the Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to the Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date or the Payment Date, as the case may be, Contingent Additional Principal and Contingent Cash Interest, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) in favor of the Holder surrendering the Securities for purchase immediately after such Purchase Date or Change -12-
in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, and the Holder surrendering such Securities for purchase shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, and accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, upon surrender of such Security). In certain circumstances, as provided in the Indenture, when a Holder surrenders Securities for purchase, the Purchase Agent may first offer such Securities to a financial institution chosen by the Issuers who will have the option, but not the obligation, (unless separately agreed to by it and the Issuers at the time) to purchase such Securities at the applicable Purchase Price). 8. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, with respect to, all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, immediately after such Redemption Date, Contingent Additional Principal and Contingent Cash Interest, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 Initial Principal Amount at Maturity may be redeemed in part but only in an Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of at least $1,000 or in integral multiples thereof. 9. Conversion. Holders may surrender Securities for conversion only if at least one of the conditions described in (a) through (d) below is satisfied. In addition, a Security for which a Holder has delivered a Purchase Notice or a Change in Control Purchase Notice requiring the Issuers to purchase the Security may be surrendered for conversion only if such notice is withdrawn in accordance with the Indenture. The initial Conversion Rate is 9.7087 shares per $1,000 Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of a Security, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events described in the Indenture. A Holder otherwise entitled to a fractional share will receive cash in an amount equal to the value of such fractional share based on the Sale Price on the trading day immediately preceding the Conversion Date. The ability to surrender Securities for conversion will expire at the close of business on July 1, 2038. (a) Before June 15, 2023, Holders may surrender a Security for conversion at the then-applicable conversion price during any calendar quarter, commencing after June 30, 2003 if the average Conversion Values of the Security for each of the last 20 trading days in the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to a specified percentage of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity; initially 125% for the quarter ending September 30, 2003, and increasing 5% per quarter for each quarter thereafter up to a maximum of 220% of the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of the Security for the quarter ending June 30, 2008. Thereafter, -13-
this percentage shall remain at 220%. If the foregoing condition is satisfied at any time after June 15, 2004 and before June 15, 2023, then the Securities will become and remain convertible at any time thereafter at the option of the Holder, through maturity. On or after June 15, 2023, Holders may surrender a Security for conversion during any calendar quarter if the average of the Conversion Values of the Security for each of the last 20 trading days in the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 110% of the Principal Amount at Maturity of the Security. If the foregoing condition is satisfied, then the Securities will become and remain convertible at any time thereafter at the option of the Holder, through maturity. (b) Holders may also surrender a Security for conversion at the then-applicable conversion price at any time after the credit rating assigned to the Securities is reduced to Ba1 or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BBB- or lower by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, even if the credit rating assigned has subsequently been changed to a higher rating. (c) A Holder may surrender for conversion at the then-applicable conversion price a Security with respect to which the Issuers have mailed a Redemption Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, even if it is not otherwise convertible at that time. (d) If the Company elects to o distribute to all Holders of Common Stock certain rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days, Common Stock at less than the Sale Price at the time, or o distribute to all Holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase securities of the Company, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Company's Board of Directors exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company must notify the Holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at the then-applicable conversion price at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place. Contingent Cash Interest will not be paid on Securities that are converted; provided, however that Holders of Securities surrendered for conversion during the period after the applicable record date and prior to the next succeeding interest payment date, shall be entitled to receive such Contingent Cash Interest on the date on which such Contingent Cash Interest is payable. Except Securities with respect to which the Issuers have mailed a Notice of Redemption, Securities surrendered for conversion during such periods must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the Contingent Cash Interest with respect thereto that the registered Holder is to receive. The Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for accrued Contingent Additional Principal, if any, or Contingent Cash Interest, if any. As soon as practicable following the Conversion Date, -14-
the Issuers will deliver through the Conversion Agent, the Cash Amount, together with cash or a certificate for the number of full shares of Common Stock into which the Premium of any Security is converted and any cash payment for fractional shares. Delivery to the Holder of the Cash Amount, together with such cash or shares of Common Stock deliverable in connection with the Premium, will be deemed to satisfy the Issuers' obligation to pay the Principal Amount at Maturity of and any accrued Contingent Additional Principal on the Security. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph 9 and notwithstanding the fact that any other condition to conversion has not been satisfied, in the event the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property as set forth in Section 10.14 of the Indenture, the Securities may be surrendered for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the date the Company announces the anticipated effective time until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction, and at the effective time of such transaction the right to convert a Security into Common Stock will be deemed to have changed into a right to convert it into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property which the Holder would have received if the Holder had converted its Security immediately prior to the transaction. If the transaction also constitutes a Change in Control, the Holder will be able to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its Securities as described under paragraph 7 herein. To convert a Security, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice below (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Issuers or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. The "Conversion Date" as used herein refers to the date on which all of the foregoing requirements have been satisfied. A Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of a Security, that portion of accrued Contingent Additional Principal attributable to the period from the Issue Date through the Conversion Date and (except as provided above) accrued Contingent Cash Interest with respect to the converted Security shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through the delivery of the Cash Amount together with cash or Common Stock in respect of the Premium, in exchange for the Security being converted pursuant to the terms hereof; and the fair market value of such cash or Common Stock in respect of the Premium, shall be treated as delivered to the extent thereof, in exchange for Contingent Additional Principal accrued through the Conversion Date and accrued Contingent Cash Interest, and the Cash Amount shall be treated as delivered in exchange for the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity of the Security being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. The Conversion Rate will be adjusted as provided in Article 10 of the Indenture. However, no adjustment need be made if Securityholders may participate in the transaction or in certain other cases. The Company from time to time may voluntarily increase the Conversion Rate. -15-
In certain circumstances as provided for in the Indenture, when a Holder surrenders a Security for conversion, the Conversion Agent may first offer the Security to a financial institution chosen by the Issuers who will have the option, but not the obligation (unless separately agreed to by it and the Issuers at the time) to agree to exchange those Securities for the number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder of those Securities would have been otherwise entitled to receive upon conversion, plus cash for any fractional shares. 10. Conversion Arrangement on Call for Redemption. In connection with any redemption of Securities (unless such Securities have been surrendered by the close of business on the Redemption Date), the Issuers may arrange for the purchase and conversion of any Securities called for redemption by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other purchasers to purchase such Securities, as provided for in the Indenture. 11. Defaulted Interest. Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Securities, any Defaulted Interest on any Security shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant record date, by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Issuers as provided in Section 11.02 of the Indenture. 12. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Change in Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a Notice of Redemption of Securities to be redeemed. 13. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes. 14. Unclaimed Money or Securities. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Issuers upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property laws. After return to the Issuers, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Issuers for -16-
payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. 15. Amendment; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Issuers and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to comply with Article 5 or Section 10.14 of the Indenture, to secure the Issuers' obligations under this Security or the Indenture, to make any change that does not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee, materially adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder, to make any change in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act or to comply with the TIA, or any amendment thereto, to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, to add to the Issuers' covenants or obligations under the Indenture for the protection of the Holders or to surrender any right, power or option conferred by the Indenture on the Issuers, or to increase the Contingent Cash Interest or any other amount to be paid to Holders. 16. Defaults and Remedies. Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default in the payment of the Principal Amount at Maturity, Contingent Additional Principal, Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price on any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon redemption, upon acceleration, when due for purchase by the Issuers or otherwise; (ii) default in payment of any Contingent Cash Interest upon any Security, and such default shall continue for 30 days; (iii) failure by the Issuers to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) (a) failure of the Issuers to make any payment by the end of any applicable grace period after maturity of Indebtedness in an amount (taken together with amounts in (b) below) in excess of $100,000,000, and continuance of such failure or (b) the acceleration of Indebtedness in an amount (taken together with amounts in (a) above) in excess of $100,000,000 because of a default with respect to such Indebtedness without such Indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled in case of (a) and (b) above, for a period of 30 days after written notice to the Issuers by the Trustee or to the Issuers and the Trustee by the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities then outstanding; however if any such failure or acceleration referred to in (a) or (b) above shall cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default by reason thereof shall be deemed not to have occurred, or (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency affecting the Issuers or their Significant Subsidiaries. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee, or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities then outstanding may declare the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity, plus any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Contingent Additional Principal through the date of such declaration, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In -17-
case of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuers, the Initial Principal Amount at Maturity plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Contingent Additional Principal, if any, shall automatically become immediately due and payable. Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (i) or (ii) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. 17. Trustee Dealings with the Issuers. Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Issuers or their Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or their Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 18. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side of this Security. 19. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 1.
