Quarter footnotes
(a)
During the third quarter of 2006, we disposed of
a U.S. based healthcare business and
several small businesses
. The sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the non-deductibility of goodwill.  This increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a one-time reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws
..  The aggregate impact of these events on the 2006 third quarter
and year-to-date period was a decrease in profit before tax of $0.5 million, a decrease in tax expense of $1.8 million and an increase in net income of $1.3 million.
(b)
As a result of the adjustments above, the "Adjusted" numbers are non-GAAP measures.    We believe that by making the adjustments above, the "Adjusted" numbers are more comparable to previous quarters and thus more meaningful for the purpose of this analysis.
(c)
Represents the change in the "Adjusted September 30, 2006" numbers compared to the "Reported September 30, 2005" numbers.
5
 
2006 Total Revenue Growth
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

(a) "Operating Income (EBIT)" and "Net Interest Expense"  calculations shown are the latest twelve month ("LTM")  figures for the periods specified.
      Although our bank agreements reference EBITDA, we have used EBIT for this presentation because EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.
(b)  Holders of our Convertible Notes Due 6/15/33 were offered a supplemental interest payment not to put the notes to us for repurchase and to
      consent to certain amendments to the notes. Holders of $428.1 million of notes consented to the amendments and were paid the supplemental
      interest, thus creating the Convertible Notes Due 7/1/38.  Holders of $39.4 million of notes did not put or consent to the amendments, and
      the terms of their notes remain unchanged.  The remaining holders of  $132.5 million of notes put the notes to us for repurchase.
