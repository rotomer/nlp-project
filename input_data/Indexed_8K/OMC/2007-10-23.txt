In connection with our two-for-one stock split distributed on June 25, 2007, which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, all current and prior period per share amounts and weighted average share amounts have been adjusted in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share."

2007 Total Revenue Growth
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

"Operating Income (EBIT)" and "Net Interest Expense"  calculations shown are the latest twelve month ("LTM")  figures for the periods specified. Although our bank agreements reference EBITDA, we have used EBIT for this presentation because EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.
(b)
In June 2006, holders of our Convertible Notes Due 6/15/33 were offered a supplemental interest payment not to put the notes to us for repurchase and to consent to certain amendments to the notes, including extending the maturity date on such notes.  Holders of $467.3 million of notes  consented to the amendments, thus creating the Convertible Notes Due 7/1/38.  The remaining holders of the notes put the notes to us for repurchase.

(a)  The ultimate payments will vary as they are dependent on future events and changes in FX rates.
In conjunction with certain transactions, Omnicom has agreed to acquire (at the sellers' option) additional equity interests. If these rights are exercised, there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense.
