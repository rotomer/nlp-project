2008 Total Revenue Growth
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

Potential Obligations
(a)  The ultimate payments will vary as they are dependent on future events and changes in FX rates.
In conjunction with certain transactions, Omnicom has agreed to acquire (at the sellers' option) additional equity interests. If these rights are exercised, there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense.
