2008 Total Revenue Growth
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

Current Credit Picture
(a)
"EBITDA" and "Gross Interest Expense" calculations shown are the latest twelve month ("LTM") figures for the periods specified. EBITDA is defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.   Although EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure, we believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on EBITDA (see reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA on page 21).

The above chart reflects Omnicom's debt outstanding at September 30, 2008.  The amount reflected above for the 10 Year Notes represents the value of these notes at maturity on April 15, 2016.

Omnicom Debt Structure
The Bank Facility and Commercial Paper Program together provide liquidity in the event any convertible notes are put.   We then have flexibility to refinance in different debt capital markets.
Our 2031 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in February 2009. Our 2032 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in July 2009.  Our 2038 Notes are putable in June 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and annually thereafter.  
For purposes of this presentation we have included the following borrowings as of September 30, 2008 as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility: commercial paper of $113 million, short-term borrowings of $64 million and other debt of $20 million. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful for purposes of understanding how we evaluate the maturities of our debt structure.

Reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on page 9 of this presentation. The above
reconciles our GAAP Operating Income to EBITDA for the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations   Our credit facility defines EBITDA as
earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our
compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage.   EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating
Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants.  Management does not
use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.

In conjunction with certain transactions, Omnicom has agreed to acquire (at the sellers' option) additional equity interests. If these rights are exercised, there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense.
