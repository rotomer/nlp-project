The partnership purchased the convertible notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit.

(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

(a)
"EBITDA" and "Gross Interest Expense" calculations shown are for the twelve months ending December 31. EBITDA is defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Although EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure, we  believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on  EBITDA (see reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA on page 21).
(b)
On February 9, 2009, holders of $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of Omnicom's convertible notes due 2031 put their notes to Omnicom for purchase at par in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the convertible notes were issued.  Omnicom borrowed $814.4 million under its existing $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and received $26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in the partnership referred to below to fund the purchase of the notes.  Omnicom purchased and retired $295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes that had been put. A partnership controlled by Omnicom and formed for the purpose of buying the convertible notes used a portion of Omnicom's credit facility borrowings and the contributed equity to purchase the remaining $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that were put.  The partnership purchased the convertible notes intending to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit.  The partnership will be consolidated within Omnicom's financial statements.

The Bank Facility and Commercial Paper Program together provide liquidity in the event any convertible notes are put.  We then have flexibility to refinance in different debt capital markets.
Our 2031 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in February 2009. Our 2032 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in July 2009.  Our 2038 Notes are putable in June 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and annually thereafter.
On February 9, 2009, holders of $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of Omnicom's convertible notes due 2031 put their notes to Omnicom for purchase at par in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the convertible notes were issued.  Omnicom borrowed $814.4 million under its existing $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and received $26.8 million from unaffiliated equity investors in the partnership referred to below to fund the purchase of the notes.

The partnership will be consolidated within Omnicom's financial statements.
For purposes of this presentation we have included the following borrowings as of December 31, 2008 as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility: short-term borrowings of $16 million and other debt of $20 million. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful for purposes of understanding how we evaluate the maturities of our debt structure.

Reconciliation of Operating Income to  EBITDA
February 10, 2009
21
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on pages 8 & 18 of this presentation. The above reconciles our GAAP Operating Income to EBITDA for the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations   Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage.   EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants.   Management does not use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.

The ultimate payments will vary as they are dependent on future events, including changes in FX rates.
In conjunction with certain transactions, Omnicom has agreed to acquire (at the sellers' option) additional equity interests. If these rights are exercised, there would likely be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense.
