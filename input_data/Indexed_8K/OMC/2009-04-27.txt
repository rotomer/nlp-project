Total Revenue Growth  First Quarter 2009
April 27, 2009
(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

(a)
"EBITDA" and "Gross Interest Expense" calculations shown are for the twelve months ending March 31.  EBITDA is defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Although EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure, we  believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on  EBITDA (see reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA on page 23).

Omnicom Debt Structure
April 27, 2009

The Bank Facility and Commercial Paper Program together provide liquidity in the event any convertible notes are put.  We then have flexibility to refinance in different debt capital markets.
Our 2031 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in February 2010. Our 2032 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in July 2009.  Our 2038 Notes are putable in June 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and annually thereafter.
For purposes of this presentation we have included the following borrowings as of March 31, 2009 as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility: short-term borrowings of $44 million, revolver borrowings of $475 million, commercial paper of $30 million and  and other debt of $18 million. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful for purposes of understanding how we evaluate the maturities of our debt structure.

Note: On February 9, 2009, $841.2 million aggregate principal amount of Omnicom's convertible notes due 2031 were put to Omnicom for purchase at par and $5.8 million of the notes remain outstanding.  Omnicom borrowed $814.4 million under its existing $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility.  A partnership controlled by Omnicom and formed for the purpose of buying the convertible notes used a portion of the proceeds under Omnicom's borrowing to purchase $546.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that were put.  The controlled partnership purchased the convertible notes with the intent to sell such notes back into the marketplace over the next 12 months if market conditions permit.  The partnership is consolidated within Omnicom's financial statements.
Omnicom repurchased the remaining $295.2 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes that had been put, all of which have been retired.

Q1 2009 vs. Q1 2008 Earnings Per Share (a)
April 27, 2009
a)
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1 entitled "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities".  Our unvested restricted stock awards pay dividends and therefore qualify as participating securities.  In accordance with EITF 03-6-1, Net income, for the purposes of the basic and diluted EPS calculation is reduced for a presumed hypothetical distribution of earnings to the holders of the unvested restricted stock. Accordingly, the effect of the allocation required under EITF 03-6-1 reduces Earnings Available to Common Shareholders.  Additionally, the unvested restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  The above information reflects the effect of the adoption on Earnings per Share as if we adopted EITF 03-6-1 at the beginning of the period and the 2008 amounts have been adjusted (see page 21).

Reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA
April 27, 2009
23
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on pages 7 & 16 of this presentation. The above reconciles our GAAP Operating Income to EBITDA for the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations   Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage.   EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants.  Management does not use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.
