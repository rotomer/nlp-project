On January 1, 2009 we adopted SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  -  an amendment of ARB No. 51. In
accordance with the presentation requirements of SFAS 160, we have reclassified the amounts reported previously as minority interest expense in
2008 as net income attributed to noncontrolling interests to be consistent with the 2009 presentation.

2009 Total Revenue Change
July 23, 2009

(a) To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue. The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

12 Months ended June 30,
(a)
"EBITDA" and "Gross Interest Expense" calculations shown are for the twelve months ending June 30.  EBITDA is defined as operating income
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Although EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure, we  believe EBITDA is more meaningful for
purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on  EBITDA (see reconciliation of Operating Income to
EBITDA on page 22).
(b)
On July 1, 2009 the Company completed the sale of $500 million of  Senior Notes due July 15, 2019.  The Company plans to use the net proceeds  
to pay down its borrowings under the Revolver and for general corporate purposes, which could include capital transactions, purchases of treasury
shares, working capital expenditures, acquisitions or refinancing of other debt.

Omnicom Debt Structure
Supplemental Information
The above chart sets forth Omnicom's adjusted debt outstanding at June 30, 2009.  The adjustment reflects the July 1, 2009 issuance of the 2019 Senior Notes as if the issuance occurred on June 30, 2009 and assumes that a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to reduce the $200 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2009.  The amounts reflected above for the 2016 and 2019 Senior Notes represent the principal amount of these notes at maturity on April 15, 2016 and July 15, 2019, respectively.

The Bank Facility and Commercial Paper Program together provide liquidity in the event any convertible notes are put.  We then have flexibility to refinance in different debt capital markets.
Our 2031 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in February 2010. Our 2032 Notes are putable annually, with the next put date in July 2009. Our 2038 Notes are putable in June 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and annually thereafter.
For purposes of this presentation we have adjusted Omnicom's debt outstanding at June 30, 2009. The adjustment reflects the July 1, 2009 issuance of the 2019 Senior Notes as if the issuance occurred on June 30, 2009 and assumes that a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to reduce the $200 million of borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2009.  We have included the following borrowings as of June 30, 2009 as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility: short-term borrowings of $42 million, revolver borrowings of zero and other debt of $19 million. We believe that this presentation is more meaningful for purposes of understanding how we evaluate the maturities of our debt structure.

Second Quarter
Year to Date
(a)
On January 1, 2009, we adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1 entitled "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities".  Our unvested restricted stock awards pay dividends and therefore qualify as participating securities.  In accordance with
EITF 03-6-1, Net income, for the purposes of the basic and diluted EPS calculation is reduced for a presumed hypothetical distribution of earnings to
the holders of the unvested restricted stock. Accordingly, the effect of the allocation required under EITF 03-6-1 reduces Earnings Available to
Common Shareholders.  Additionally, the unvested restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion
would have been anti-dilutive.  The above information reflects the effect of the adoption on Earnings per Share as if we adopted EITF 03-6-1 at the
beginning of the period and the 2008 amounts have been adjusted.

Reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA
July 23, 2009
22
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on pages 7 & 17 of this presentation. The above reconciles our GAAP Operating Income to EBITDA for the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations   Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage.   EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants.  Management does not use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.
