(a)
To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue.  The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b)
Acquisition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses.  Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c)
Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

"EBITDA" and "Gross Interest Expense" calculations shown are for the twelve months ending September 30.  EBITDA is defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Although EBITDA  is a non-GAAP measure, we  believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on  EBITDA (see reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA on page 21).

For purposes of this presentation we have included the following borrowings as of September 30, 2009 as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility: short-term borrowings of $33 million, commercial paper borrowings of $144 million and other debt of $16 million.

2009 vs. 2008 Earnings Per Share (a)
(a)
On January 1, 2009, we adopted revisions to ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share - Participating Securities and the Two- Class Method, which provides that all outstanding unvested share-based payments that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends participate in the undistributed earnings with the common shareholders and are therefore participating securities.  Companies with participating securities are required to apply the two-class method in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.  On adoption of the revised guidance, we retrospectively restated basic and diluted Net Income per Common Share - Omnicom Group Inc. for each period presented.

Reconciliation of Operating Income to EBITDA
October 21, 2009
21
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on pages 7 & 16 of this presentation. The above reconciles our GAAP Operating Income to EBITDA for the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage.   EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants.  Management does not use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.
