Reconciliation of non-GAAP Measure
The covenants contained in our credit facility are based on the EBITDA ratios as presented on pages 8 & 17 of this presentation. The above reconciles EBITDA to the GAAP financial measures the periods presented.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage. EBITDA is not, and should not, be used as a substitute for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and is only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants. Management does not use EBITDA for any other measurement purpose.
