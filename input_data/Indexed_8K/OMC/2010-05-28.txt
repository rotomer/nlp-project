Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(e) On May 25, 2010, the shareholders of Omnicom Group Inc. (the "Company") approved the Omnicom Group Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan (i) increased the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2007 Incentive Award Plan (the "2007 Plan") by 11,499,624 shares of common stock, such that the total number of shares that may be issued pursuant to awards granted after December 31, 2009 equals 17 million shares; (ii) changed the ratio by which awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights are counted against the number of shares available for issuance under the 2007 Plan; and (iii) changed the ratio by which shares will be added back to the number of shares that may be issued under the 2007 Plan in the event of a termination, lapse or expiration of an award. In addition, the Company's shareholders re-approved the list of performance criteria in the Plan that may be used for purposes of granting awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. A more detailed description of the Plan is available in the Company's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 15, 2010 (the "Proxy Statement") under the heading, "Items to be Voted onItem 3Approval of Amended and Restated 2007 Incentive Award Plan and Re-approval of Performance Criteria."
     The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, a copy of which is filed as Appendix A with the Proxy Statement, and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
(a) On May 25, 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to Article I, Section 8 of the Company's By-laws to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality standard to a majority standard. The new majority voting standard will apply to the election of directors at the Company's 2011 annual meeting of shareholders.
     Under the newly adopted amendment, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" such nominee. For this purpose, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote cast. If an incumbent nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, that director shall promptly offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee of the Board will then consider whether to accept the director's resignation and make a recommendation to the Board. The Board will then consider the resignation, and within 90 days after the date of certification of the election results, the Board shall publicly disclose its decision and the reasons for its decision. The director whose resignation is under consideration may not participate in any deliberation regarding his or her resignation unless none of the directors received a majority of the votes cast. If the Board accepts a director's resignation, the Board may elect a replacement in accordance with the By-laws.
     In the case of a contested election, where the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected, a plurality of the votes standard will continue to apply.
     The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Article I, Section 8 of the By-laws, as amended, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
     The Company held its annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") on May 25, 2010 in Wilmington, Delaware. At the Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders elected twelve individuals to the Board of Directors, approved four proposals and rejected two proposals. The proposals are described in more detail in the Proxy Statement.

Exhibit 3.2
BY-LAWS
OF
OMNICOM GROUP INC.
A NEW YORK CORPORATION
(AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MAY 25, 2010)
ARTICLE I
MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS
     SECTION 1. . All meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation will be held at such places, within or outside of the State of New York, as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Place of Meetings
     SECTION 2. . Commencing in the year 1988, the annual meeting of shareholders will be held on such date and at such time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting of shareholders the shareholders will elect directors and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. No shareholder shall have any right to bring a matter before the shareholders for a vote at the annual meeting of shareholders, unless such shareholder shall have given the Secretary of the Corporation written notice of his intention to do so not less than 60 days prior to the date set for the annual meeting. Such notice shall include the name and address of the shareholder proposing to bring such matter before such meeting, identify the matter proposed to be brought before the meeting and disclose the shareholder's interest in the proposed matter. No shareholder shall have any right to propose or nominate a nominee for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, unless such shareholder shall have given the Secretary of the Corporation written notice of his intention to do so not less than 60 days before the date set for the annual meeting. Such notice shall include as to each nominee and such shareholder (i) the information as to such nominee and shareholder
Annual Meeting
that would be required to be included in a proxy statement under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission if such shareholder were to solicit proxies from all shareholders of the Corporation for the election of such nominee as a director and such solicitation were one to which Rules 14a-3 to 14a-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, apply and (ii) the information as to such nominee and shareholder specified in Schedule 14B under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If, at any such meeting, a shareholder gives notice of intention to propose that action be taken which would, if taken, entitle shareholders fulfilling the requirements of Section 623 of the Business Corporation Law of New York (relating to the procedure to enforce a shareholder's right to receive payment for his shares) to receive payment for their shares, such notice shall include a statement to that effect.
     SECTION 3. . Written notice of each annual meeting of shareholders stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, will be given in the manner set forth in Article IV of these By-Laws not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting.
Notice of Annual Meeting
     SECTION 4. . Special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time for any purpose or purposes, by the Board of Directors, or by the President, and shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the written request of a majority of the Board of Directors. A request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.
Special Meetings
     SECTION 5. . Notice of each special meeting of shareholders will be given in the manner set forth in Article IV of these By-Laws not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting.
Notice of Special Meeting
2
Each notice will state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and indicate by whom it is being called.
     SECTION 6. . Except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders will be necessary, and will constitute a quorum, for the transaction of business at that meeting. If a quorum is not present or represented by proxy at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting who are present in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. An adjourned meeting may be held later without notice other than announcement at the meeting, except that if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in the manner set forth in Article IV to each stockholder entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
Quorum
     SECTION 7. . The only persons entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders will be the persons shown as shareholders of the Corporation on the stock records of the Corporation on the record date fixed by the Board of Directors, or, in the absence of a record date, at the close of business on the date the notice of the meeting is given.
Qualification of Voters
     SECTION 8. . At any meeting of shareholders each shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, each shareholder will be entitled to one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote standing in his name on the books of the Corporation. Except with respect
Voting
3
to the election of directors and as otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, all matters will be determined by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting on it.
     Except as otherwise provided by these By-Laws, a nominee for director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy with respect to such nominee's election at any meeting that includes the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a nominee for director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at any meeting that includes the election of directors at which a quorum is present if, as of the 10th day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the shareholders of the Corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), provided that with respect to any nominee proposed or nominated by a shareholder, the Secretary of the Corporation shall have received proper notice under Section 2 of this Article. For purposes of this Section, if plurality voting is applicable to the election of directors at any meeting, the nominees who receive the highest number of votes cast "for," without regard to votes cast "against" or "withhold," shall be elected as directors up to the total number of directors to be elected at that meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote cast with respect to any election of directors.
     In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a
4
Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose. If an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Governance Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Governance Committee's recommendation, and within 90 days after the date of certification of the election results, the Board shall disclose its decision and rationale regarding whether to accept the resignation (or the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable) in a press release, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or by other public announcement. The director whose resignation is under consideration may not participate in any deliberation or vote of the Governance Committee or Board of Directors regarding his or her resignation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that no nominee for director receives a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the members of the Governance Committee shall make a final determination as to whether the Board shall accept any or all resignations, including their own. The Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors and other information they deem appropriate and relevant in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation.
     If an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election in an election that is not a Contested Election and such director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director will continue to serve until the expiration date of such director's term in office or until such director's earlier removal pursuant to Article II, Section 3 of these By-Laws. If such director's resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the
5
nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of these By-Laws.
     SECTION 9. . Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the vote of shareholders is required or permitted in connection with any corporate action, that action may be taken without a meeting on written consent setting forth the action which is taken, signed by the holders of all the outstanding shares entitled to vote on it.

Except as may otherwise be provided by law, cause for removal shall exist only if the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable for acts committed in bad faith or the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and such acts were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or acts in which he personally gained a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled, or has been adjudicated mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any other committees will have such authority as the Board of Directors may provide. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of the Executive Committee or any other committee to replace absent members. Members of all committees will serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
Executive Committee and Other Committees
     SECTION 7. . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all the members of the Board or the committee consent in writing to the adoption of a resolution authorizing the action. The resolution and the written consents by the members of the Board or committee shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or committee.
Action by Unanimous Written Consent
     SECTION 8. .

INDEMNIFICATION
SECTION 1. .
Indemnification  Third Party and Derivative Actions
     (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding (including, without limitation, one by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor), whether civil or criminal, including an action by or in the right of any other Corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, which any director or officer of the Corporation served in any capacity at the request of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate,
14
was a director or officer of the Corporation, or served such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise at the request of the Corporation in any capacity, against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and necessarily incurred as a result of such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, provided that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of such person if (i) his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of his or her active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to such action or proceedings or (ii) he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled.
     (b) The termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that any such person did not act, in good faith, for a purpose which he or she reasonably believed to be in, or, in the case of service for any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation or that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
     SECTION 2. . The Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify or advance the expenses of any other person including agents and employees to whom the Corporation is permitted by law to provide indemnification or advancement of expenses.
Other Indemnification
     SECTION 3. . To the fullest extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law, the Corporation will advance to any person who may be entitled to indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 sums with which to pay expenses incurred by
Payment of Expenses in Advance
15
that person in defending against the claims, actions or proceedings for which such person may become entitled to indemnification, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay the sums which are advanced if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 to the extent the sums which are advanced exceed the indemnification to which such person is entitled.
     SECTION 4. . The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the person in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within 60 days. Such person's expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses under Section 3 of this Article where the required undertaking has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has conducted himself or herself in a manner which would preclude the Corporation from indemnifying him or her pursuant to Sections 1 or 2 of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its shareholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its shareholders) that indemnification of the claimant is not proper in the circumstances shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification.
Enforcement; Defenses
16
SECTION 5. .
Survival; Savings Clause; Preservation of Other Rights
     (a) The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each person who serves in such capacity at any time while these provisions are in effect, and any repeal or modification of the New York Business Corporation Law shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts, except as provided by law.
