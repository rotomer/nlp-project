in the event any

that we will then have

markets.
Our 2032

putable

August
2011 and
annually

until
maturity.
Our 2038
Convertible
Notes are

maturity.
Other borrowings at September 30, 2010 include short-term borrowings of $63 million and other debt of $7 million, which are due in less than one year. For purposes of this presentation we have included these borrowings as outstanding through June 2011, the date of expiration of our five-year credit facility.
Senior Notes Due 2020
Senior Notes Due 2019
Senior Notes Due 2016
In August 2010, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the $1 billion principal amount of our 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 ("2016 Notes"). Under the terms of these agreements, we will receive fixed interest rate payments and will make variable interest rate payments on the total principal value of the 2016 Notes. These agreements effectively convert the 2016 Notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt from the date we entered into the swaps through the maturity of the 2016 Notes. The swap agreements qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes at inception and at September 30, 2010 and are designated as a fair value hedge on the 2016 Notes. The variable interest rate we pay is based on the one month and three month U.S. LIBOR rate, flat. The fixed rate we receive is 1.766%. The swaps mature on April 15, 2016, the maturity date of the 2016 Notes.

Reconciliation of non-GAAP Measures
The above
reconciles EBITDA
& EBITA to the GAAP
financial measures
for the
periods presented.
EBITDA and EBITA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our credit facility uses EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios as presented on pages 7 & 17 of this presentation. Management uses EBITA as an additional operating performance measure, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, because it believes that EBITA is a useful measure to evaluate the performance of our businesses. EBITDA and EBITA are not, and should not, be used as substitutes for Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP and are only used to measure our compliance with our debt covenants and as an additional performance measure of our businesses.
