If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this Section 2.14(e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Agent, OFI and OCI and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

     (ii) If a payment made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by Sections 1471(a) and 1472(a) of the Internal Revenue Code if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or Section 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable, and the regulations thereunder), such Lender shall deliver to OFI and OCI and the Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by OFI and OCI or the Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by OFI and OCI or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
     (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide OFI and OCI with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in Section 2.14(e) ( if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under Section 2.14(e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to a gross-up or indemnification under Section 2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure, including any United States federal withholding tax imposed as a result of a failure to satisfy the applicable requirements of FATCA after December 31, 2010, or such later date on which the requirements of FATCA become effective; , , that should a Lender become subject to

     (g) In respect of Advances to OFP, each Lender shall designate an Applicable Lending Office that is beneficially entitled to interest under such Advances and that, on the date of this Agreement or (in the case of any Person that becomes a Lender hereunder by means of an assignment) on the date such Lender becomes a party hereto is either (i) within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax in respect of interest in respect of an advance by a Person that was a bank (for the purposes of Section 879 of the ITA) at the time the advance was made; or (ii) resident in a country with which the United Kingdom has a double taxation agreement which makes provision for full exemption from United Kingdom taxation on interest payable by OFP pursuant to this Agreement and does not carry on business in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment with which the payment is effectively connected (each such Person which is so resident being hereinafter in this Section 2.14 referred to as a ""); or (iii) a company resident in the United Kingdom, or a partnership each member of which is a company resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes; or (iv) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which is required to bring into account interest payable to it by OFP pursuant to this Agreement in computing its chargeable profits for the purposes of Section 19 of the CTA. If, on the date on which any interest payment falls due, any Lender does not or ceases to comply with, or is not a Person who falls within, clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above other than by reason of any change after the date of this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration or application of) any law or double taxation agreement or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority, the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate such Lender under Section 2.14(a) or 2.14(c) for the amount of Taxes imposed by the United Kingdom in consequence. Subject to Section 2.14(h)(i) below, any Lender to whom clause (ii) above is relevant and OFP shall cooperate in promptly completing any procedural formalities necessary for OFP to obtain authorization to make interest payments without deduction for United Kingdom income tax. The Borrowers shall not be required to compensate any Lender to whom clause (ii) above is relevant under Section 2.14(a) or 2.14(c) for any deduction for United Kingdom income tax from interest payments if such deduction is required as a result of the failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations in the preceding sentence (other than a failure that is attributable to the failure by OFP to comply with its obligations in the preceding sentence).
Treaty Lender
     (h) (i) A Treaty Lender which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme which becomes a party to this Agreement, and which wishes that scheme to apply to an Advance made available to OFP under this Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect by including its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in Schedule 1 hereto or, where relevant, the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance (for the benefit of the Agent and without liability to any Borrower). If such Treaty Lender includes the indication described above then OFP shall file a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Treaty Lender with HM Revenue & Customs within 30 days of the date of the amendment and restatement of this Agreement, the Assumption Agreement, or the Assignment and Acceptance (as the case may be) (as shall any other relevant United Kingdom Borrower within 30 days of that Borrower becoming party to this Agreement). If a Lender has not indicated that it wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to apply to this Agreement as per the above then no Borrower shall file any form relating to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lender's Advances. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.14 shall require a Treaty Lender to (x) register under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme; (y) apply the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to any Advance if it has so registered or (z) file any forms relating to any double taxation agreement with the United Kingdom if it has indicated that it wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to apply to this Agreement in accordance with the above and the relevant Borrower has not complied with its obligations under this Section 2.14(h)(i).
     (ii) Each Treaty Lender irrevocably appoints the Agent to act as syndicate manager under, and authorizes the Agent to operate, and take any action necessary or desirable under, the SL Scheme in connection with any Borrowing hereunder. Each Treaty Lender shall cooperate with the Agent in completing any procedural formalities necessary under the SL Scheme, and shall promptly supply to the Agent such information as the Agent may request in connection with the operation of the SL Scheme. Each Treaty Lender without limiting the liability of any Borrower under this Agreement, shall, within five Business Days of demand, indemnify the Agent for any liability or loss incurred by the Agent as a result of the Agent acting as syndicate manager under the SL Scheme in connection with the Treaty Lender's participation in any Borrowing (except to the extent that the liability or loss arises directly from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct). Each Treaty Lender shall, within five
24 Omnicom: Three Year Credit Agreement
Business Days of demand, indemnify each Borrower for any Tax which such Borrower becomes liable to pay in respect of any payments made to such Treaty Lender arising as a result of any incorrect information supplied by such Treaty Lender which results in a provisional authority issued by HM Revenue and Customs under the SL Scheme being withdrawn. Each Borrower acknowledges that it is fully aware of its contingent obligations under the SL Scheme and shall (i) promptly inform the Agent of all actions required to be performed by the Agent under the SL Scheme, (ii) promptly supply to the Agent such information as the Agent may request in connection with the operation of the SL Scheme; and (iii) act in accordance with any provisional notice issued by HM Revenue and Customs under the SL Scheme. The Agent agrees to provide, as soon as reasonably practicable, a copy of any provisional authority issued to it under the SL Scheme in connection with any Borrowing to those Borrowers specified in such provisional authority. Each of the Borrowers, the Treaty Lenders and the Agent acknowledges that the Agent: (i) is entitled to rely completely upon information provided to it in connection with this clause; (ii) is not obliged to undertake any inquiry into the accuracy of such information nor into the status of the Treaty Lender or, as the case may be, Borrower providing such information; and (iii) shall have no liability to any Person for the accuracy of any information it submits to HM Revenue and Customs in connection with this clause.
     (i) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
     (j) If the Agent or any Lender, in its sole discretion, determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes (including by virtue of a credit or offset of such Taxes or Other Taxes) as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has made a gross-up payment under Section 2.14(a) or 2.14(c), it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or gross-up paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund), that such Borrower upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower ( any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) to the Agent or such Lender if the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. This Section 2.14(j) shall not be construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to a Borrower or any other Person.

Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     (v) to the extent that the Available Amount of any outstanding Letter of Credit is cash collateralized by the Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.19, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any commission otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i) on that portion of the Available Amount that is so cash collateralized.
     (b) So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the applicable Borrower, and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(a)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).

     (7) A certificate of the Secretary of State of New York, dated __________, 2010 attesting to the continued corporate existence of the Guarantor in that State as of the date thereof.
     In addition, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records, instruments and other documents, and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
     For the purposes hereof, we have assumed, with your permission and without independent verification of any kind: (a) that the signatures of persons signing all documents in connection with which this opinion is rendered are genuine; (b) the legal capacity of all natural persons; (c) that all documents submitted to us as originals or duplicate originals are authentic; and (d) that all documents submitted to us as copies, whether certified or not, conform to authentic original documents. As to questions of fact relevant to this opinion, we have assumed, without independent investigation or verification of any kind, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties in the Credit Agreement and have relied upon certificates and oral or written statements and other information of public officials, and officers and representatives of the Loan Parties. For purposes of the opinion set forth in the paragraph numbered 1 below, we have relied solely upon copies of good standing certificates as certified by public officials as of the dates and in the jurisdictions listed on Annex I hereto.
     In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed, with your permission and without any independent investigation or verification of any kind, that: (i) OFP has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly qualified in each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its property makes such qualification necessary; (ii) OFP has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Documents to which it is a party; (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents by OFP have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of OFP; (iv) the Credit Documents have been duly executed and delivered by OFP; and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents by OFP do not and will not violate the Charter, By-laws or other organizational documents of OFP.

Furthermore, in giving the opinions set forth in paragraphs numbered 4, 5 and 6 below, we express no opinion as to state securities or blue sky laws.
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
     1. Each US Loan Party (i) is a validly existing corporation under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation listed on Annex I hereto and (ii) has the corporate power and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged. In addition, OFI is in good standing under the law of the jurisdiction of its incorporation listed on Annex I hereto.
     2. Each US Loan Party has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it. Each US Loan Party has duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered by it on the date hereof.
     3. The Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms. Each Note to be delivered by a Loan Party, assuming due execution and delivery thereof by such Loan Party, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms.
D-1-2 Omnicom: Three Year Credit Agreement
     4. Neither the execution and delivery, nor the performance, by any US Loan Party of the Credit Agreement or the Notes to be delivered by it, nor compliance by such US Loan Party with the terms and provisions thereof, (i) will contravene any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) of the United States of America or the State of New York applicable to such US Loan Party or (ii) will violate any provision of the Charter or By-Laws of such US Loan Party.
     5. Neither the execution and delivery, nor the performance, by OFP of the Credit Agreement or the Notes to be delivered by it, nor compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, will contravene any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) of the United States of America or the State of New York applicable to OFP.
     6. No order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with (except as have been obtained or made on or prior to the date hereof), or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority of the United States of America, or the State of New York, applicable to any Loan Party is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, (i) the execution, delivery and performance by any Loan Party of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it or (ii) the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be delivered by it in accordance with their terms against such Loan Party.
     7. The choice of New York law as the governing law of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is, under the laws of the State of New York, a valid choice of law.
     8. The consent by each Loan Party in Section 9.12 of the Credit Agreement to the jurisdiction of courts sitting in the State of New York is a valid consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
     Our opinions are subject to the qualifications that:
     A. The enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is subject to and may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers of debtors' or guarantors' rights), and the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, no opinion is given herein as to (i) the availability of the right to accelerate any obligation and certain remedies provided for in the Credit Agreement in the event of a nonmaterial default, or (ii) the enforceability of any provision of the Credit Agreement relating to cumulation of remedies or waiving the remedy of specific performance, or the waiver of debtors' rights.
     B. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any contractual provision in the Credit Agreement as to waiver of any procedural right, including, without limitation, (i) the first sentence of Section 9.12(a) of the Credit Agreement insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City to adjudicate any controversy related to any of the Credit Documents, and (ii) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 9.12(b) of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in a federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City.
     C. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any contractual provision in the Credit Documents relating to indemnification, including, without limitation, with respect to the enforceability of Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement, to the extent that these may be limited (i) in the case of litigation against any Loan Party which is decided adversely to the person claiming indemnification or in a case involving a claim of indemnification for attorneys' fees, (ii) by laws rendering unenforceable indemnification contrary to federal or state securities laws and the public policy underlying such laws, or (iii) by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party, or requiring
D-1-3 Omnicom: Three Year Credit Agreement
indemnification of a party, for liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.
     D. Furthermore, no opinion is given herein as to:
     (i) Section 7.02 of the Credit Agreement, to the extent that it relates to action contemplated by Section 7.02(b) of the Credit Agreement taken without the Guarantor's consent, which may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially altered; or
     (ii) the enforceability of the provisions of Section 9.11 of the Credit Agreement (A) to the extent that a judgment not in (1) Dollars is obtained in respect of the Credit Agreement in a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or (2) Committed Currencies is obtained in respect of the Credit Agreement in a jurisdiction other than a member-state of the European Union and the respective Loan Party pays such judgment or (B) insofar as those provisions contemplate an alternative or additional cause of action for a claim that may have merged with claims covered by an earlier judgment; or
     (iii) Section 7.02(h) of the Credit Agreement, to the extent it relates to any waiver of an applicable statute of limitations; or
     (iv) the enforceability of the right of setoff provided for in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement (A) in respect of an interest under the Credit Agreement purchased by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 9.07 of the Credit Agreement, to the extent the relevant purchase does not give rise to a direct obligation of any Borrower to such Lender, or (B) insofar as that right relates to setoff of unmatured obligations under the Credit Agreement or of obligations owed to any Loan Party by an Affiliate of a Lender or by an Affiliate of the Agent; or
     (v) the enforceability of Section 2.06 or 9.14 of the Credit Agreement to the extent that it constitutes a general disclaimer of the obligations or liabilities of an Issuing Bank.
     We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America. Our opinions set forth in paragraph numbers 1, 2 and 4(ii) above, as they apply to OCI, are based on our review of the Connecticut Business Corporation Act as reported by 33 Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann.  33-600 et seq. to be in effect on the date of this opinion letter.
D-1-4 Omnicom: Three Year Credit Agreement
     This opinion is rendered solely to you by us as New York counsel for the Loan Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement and the Notes. Each Lender (and its successors and permitted assigns) may rely upon this opinion in connection with those transactions. This opinion may not be relied upon in any other manner or for any other purpose, or furnished or relied upon by any other person, without our prior written consent.
