writing. These statements relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and other factors that may cause our actual or our industry's results, levels of activity or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-
looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, including those that are described in our 2010 Annual Report of Form 10-K under Item 1A - Risk Factors and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, include, but are not limited to, our future financial position and results of operations,
future global economic conditions and conditions in the credit markets, losses on media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of clients, reductions in client spending and/or a slowdown in client payments, competitive factors, changes in client communication requirements, managing conflicts of
interest, the hiring and retention of personnel, maintaining a highly skilled workforce, our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients, reliance on information technology systems, changes in government regulations impacting our advertising and marketing strategies, risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our critical accounting estimates and legal proceedings, and our international operations, which are subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls. In some cases, forward -looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect,"
"plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
We provide herein financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and adjustments to the GAAP presentation ("Non-GAAP") which we believe are meaningful for
understanding our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled
amounts reported by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures on pages 23 and 24.
The non-GAAP measures used in this presentation include the following:
Net Free Cash Flow
,
defined as Free Cash Flow (defined below) less the Primary Uses of Cash (defined below). Net Free Cash Flow is one of the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. We
believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow.
Free Cash Flow,
defined
as net income plus depreciation, amortization and share based compensation expense less other non-cash items to reconcile to net cash provided
by
operating activities and capital expenditures.
Primary Uses of Cash
,
defined as dividends to common shareholders, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest shareholders, cash paid on acquisitions, payments for additional interest in controlled subsidiaries and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds
and excess tax benefit from our stock plans, and excludes changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund these working capital changes.
EBITDA
,
defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on EBITDA.
EBITA
,
defined as operating income before interest, taxes and amortization. We use EBITA as an additional operating performance measure, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, because we believe that EBITA is a useful measure to
evaluate the performance of our businesses.
Net Debt,
defined
as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe net debt, together with the comparable GAAP measures, reflects one of the metrics used by us to assess our cash management.
After Tax Operating Income
,
defined as operating income less income taxes calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period.
Other
Information
All dollar amounts are in millions except for per share amounts. The following financial information contained in this document has not been audited, although some of it has been derived from Omnicom's historical financial statements, including its audited financial statements. In addition, industry, operational and other non-financial data contained in this document have been derived from sources we believe to be reliable, but we have not independently verified such information, and we do not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of that information. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation.

Omnicom Debt Structure
The above chart sets forth Omnicom's debt outstanding at June 30, 2011. The amounts reflected above for the 2016, 2019 and 2020 Senior Notes represent the principal amount of these notes at maturity on April 15, 2016, July 15, 2019 and August 15, 2020, respectively.
Omnicom Debt Maturity Profile
Our 2032 Convertible Notes are putable on August 1, 2011 and annually in July thereafter until maturity. Our 2038 Convertible Notes are putable in June 2013, 2018, 2023 and annually thereafter until maturity.
Other borrowings at June 30, 2011 include short-term borrowings of $66 million which are due in less than one year. For purposes of this presentation we have included these borrowings as outstanding through December 2013, the date of expiration of our three-year credit facility.
In August 2010, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 ("2016 Notes") attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Under the terms of these
agreements, we will receive fixed interest rate payments and will make variable interest rate payments on the total principal value of the 2016 Notes. These agreements effectively convert the 2016 Notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt from the inception of the swaps through the maturity of the 2016 Notes. The swap agreements qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes at inception and at June 30, 2011 and are designated as a fair value hedge on the 2016 Notes. The variable interest rate we pay is based on the one month and three month U.S. LIBOR rate, flat. The fixed rate we receive is 1.766% . The swaps mature on April 15, 2016, the same day as the 2016 Notes.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
The above reconciles EBITDA & EBITA to the GAAP financial measures for the periods presented.
EBITDA and EBITA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our credit facility defines EBITDA as earnings before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Our credit facility uses EBITDA
to measure our compliance with covenants, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios as presented on page 8 of this presentation.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
2011 Non-GAAP Measures  Impact of Remeasurement Gain and Repositioning Actions on Operating Expenses
The table above presents the impact of the remeasument gain and repositioning actions taken in the first quarter of 2011 on our year to date results.
We recorded a $123.4 million non-cash gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our existing ownership interests in the Clemenger Group, our affiliate in Australia and New Zealand, in which we acquired a controlling interest. The
acquisition brought our ownership up to 73.7% from 46.7%. The difference between the fair value of our shares in Clemenger Group at the acquisition date and the carrying value of our investment held prior to the acquisition resulted in the remeasurement gain.
We recognized repositioning charges of $131.3 million that were the result of our strategic review that is focused on improving our strategic position and operations. Our repositioning actions included $92.8 million in severance costs and $38.5 million in lease termination charges, as well as asset and goodwill write-offs, net of gain on dispositions.
2011 Non-GAAP Measures  Impact of Remeasurement Gain and Repositioning Actions on Income Taxes
The table above presents Income Before Income Taxes, as adjusted and Income Taxes, as adjusted for the 2011 year to date period. These are Non-GAAP financial measures. Both Income Before Income Taxes, as adjusted and Income
Taxes, as adjusted exclude the gain on the remeasurement of our equity interest in Clemenger Group and the repositioning charges recognized in the first quarter of 2011, as well as a tax accrual we recorded in accordance with ASC 740 (FIN 48 accrual) during the first quarter of 2011.
