Forward-Looking Statements

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We provide herein financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and adjustments to the GAAP presentation (Non-GAAP) which we believe are meaningful for understanding our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures on pages 23 and 24.
The non-GAAP measures used in this presentation include the following:
, defined as Free Cash Flow (defined below) less the Primary Uses of Cash (defined below). Net Free Cash Flow is one of the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow. defined as net income plus depreciation, amortization and share based compensation expense less other non-cash items to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. , defined as dividends to common shareholders, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest shareholders, cash paid on acquisitions, payments for additional interest in controlled subsidiaries and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds and excess tax benefit from our stock plans, and excludes changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund these working capital changes.
Net Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow,
Primary Uses of Cash
, defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is more meaningful for purposes of this analysis because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on EBITDA.
EBITDA
, defined as operating income before interest, taxes and amortization. We use EBITA as an additional operating performance measure, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, because we believe that EBITA is a useful measure to evaluate the performance of our businesses.
EBITA
defined as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe net debt, together with the comparable GAAP measures, reflects one of the metrics used by us to assess our cash management.
Net Debt,
, defined as operating income less income taxes calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period.
After Tax Operating Income
All dollar amounts are in millions except for per share amounts. The following financial information contained in this document has not been audited, although some of it has been derived from Omnicoms historical financial statements, including its audited financial statements. In addition, industry, operational and other non-financial data contained in this document have been derived from sources we believe to be reliable, but we have not independently verified such information, and we do not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of that information.

See page 25 for the impact of these transactions on our operating income. (d) The tax effect of the above items referred to in footnote (c) above is a benefit of $36.7 million.

The after-tax effect of these items increased Net Income by $19.8 million and reduced our effective tax rate. See page 26 for the impact of these items on our effective tax rate.
