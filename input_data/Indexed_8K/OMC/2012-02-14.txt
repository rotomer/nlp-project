These risks and
uncertainties, including

in our 2011
Annual

Factors
and Item 7 -
Management's Discussion

such as "may," "will,"
"could," "would," "should," "expect,"
"plan,"
"anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential"
or

or the

Actual events or results may differ. We
undertake
no
obligation
to
update
or revise any
forward

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We
provide
herein
financial measures determined
in
accordance
with
generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States
("GAAP")
and
adjustments
to the GAAP
presentation
("Non-
GAAP"),
which we
believe
are
meaningful
for
understanding
our
performance.
Non-GAAP
financial measures
should not be
considered
in
isolation
from, or as a
substitute
for,
financial information presented
in
compliance
with
GAAP.
Non-GAAP
financial measures
as
reported
by us may not be
comparable
to
similarly
titled
amounts reported
by other
companies.
We
provide
a
reconciliation
of non-GAAP
measures
to the
comparable
GAAP
measures
on pages 17 and 18.
The non-GAAP
measures
used in this
presentation include
the
following:
Net Free Cash Flow
,
defined
as Free Cash Flow
(defined
below) less the
Primary
Uses of Cash
(defined
below). Net Free Cash Flow is one of the
metrics
used by us to
assess
our
sources
and uses of cash and was
derived
from our
consolidated statements
of cash flows. We
believe
that this
presentation
is
meaningful
for
understanding
our
primary sources
and
primary
uses of that cash flow.
Free Cash Flow,
defined
as net
income
plus
depreciation, amortization,
share based
compensation expense
and gain on
remeasurement
of equity
interest
in
affiliates
less other non-cash items to
reconcile
to net cash
provided
by
operating activities.
Primary
Uses of Cash
,
defined
as
dividends
to
common shareholders, dividends
paid to
noncontrolling interest shareholders,
capital
expenditures,
cash paid on
acquisitions, payments
for
additional interest
in
controlled subsidiaries
and stock
repurchases,
net of the
proceeds
and
excess
tax benefit from our stock plans, and
excludes changes
in
working
capital and other
investing
and
financing activities, including commercial
paper
issuances
and
redemptions
used to fund these
working
capital
changes.
EBITDA
,
defined
as
operating income
before
interest,
taxes,
depreciation
and
amortization.
We
believe EBITDA
is more
meaningful
for
purposes
of this
analysis because
the
financial covenants
in our credit
facilities
are based on
EBITDA.
EBITA
,
defined
as
operating income
before
interest,
taxes and
amortization.
We use EBITA as an
additional operating performance measure,
which
excludes acquisition
-
related amortization expense, because
we
believe
that EBITA is a useful
measure
to
evaluate
the
performance
of our
businesses.
Net Debt,
defined
as total debt less cash, cash
equivalents
and short-term
investments.
We
believe
net debt,
together
with the
comparable
GAAP
measures, reflects
one of the
metrics
used by us to
assess
our cash
management.
After Tax
Operating Income
,
defined
as
operating income
less
income
taxes
calculated
using the
effective
tax rate for the
applicable period.

amounts
are in

amounts.

The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency. (b) Acquisition/Disposition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period. (c) Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth. February 14, 2012 3
