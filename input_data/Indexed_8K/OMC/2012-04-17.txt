Reconciliation
of Non-GAAP
Measures
The above
reconciles EBITDA
& EBITA to the GAAP
financial measures
for the
periods presented.
EBITDA
and EBITA are non-GAAP
financial measures
within the
meaning
of
applicable
SEC rules. Our credit facility
defines EBITDA
as
earnings
before
deducting interest expense, income
taxes,
depreciation
and
amortization.
Our credit facility uses
EBITDA
to
measure
our
compliance
with
covenants,
such as
interest coverage
and
leverage
ratios as
presented
on page 10 of this
presentation.

have made or may make
forward
-
looking statements,

writing.
These
statements
relate to future events or future
financial performance
and
involve
known and
unknown
risks and other factors that may cause our actual or our
industry's results,
levels of
activity
or
achievement
to be
materially different
from those
expressed
or
implied
by any
forward
-
looking statements.
These risks and
uncertainties, including
those that are
described
in our 2011
Annual
Report of Form 10-K under Item 1A - Risk
Factors
and Item 7 -
Management's Discussion
and
Analysis
of
Financial Condition
and
Results
of
Operations, include,
but are not limited to, our future
financial position
and results of
operations,
global
economic conditions
and
conditions
in the credit
markets,
losses on media
purchases
and
production
costs
incurred
on behalf of
clients, reductions
in client
spending
and/or a
slowdown
in client
payments, competitive factors, changes
in client
communication requirements, managing conflicts
of
interest,

retention
of
personnel, maintaining
a highly skilled

in
government regulations impacting
our
advertising
and
marketing strategies,
risks
associated
with
assumptions
we make in
connection
with our critical
accounting estimates
and legal
proceedings,
and our
international operations,
which are
subject
to the risks of
currency fluctuations
and foreign
exchange controls.
In some cases,
forward
-
looking statements
can be
identified
by
terminology
such as "may," "will,"
"could," "would," "should," "expect,"
"plan,"
"anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential"
or
"continue"
or the
negative
of those terms or other
comparable terminology.
These
statements
are our
present expectations.
Actual events or results may differ. We
undertake
no
obligation
to
update
or revise any
forward
-
looking statement,
except as
required
by law.
Non-GAAP
Financial Measures
We
provide
herein
financial measures determined
in
accordance
with
generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States
("GAAP")
and
adjustments
to the GAAP
presentation
("Non-
GAAP"),
which we
believe
are
meaningful
for
understanding
our
performance.
Non-GAAP
financial measures
should not be
considered
in
isolation
from, or as a
substitute
for,
financial information presented
in
compliance
with
GAAP.
Non-GAAP
financial measures
as
reported
by us may not be
comparable
to
similarly
titled
amounts reported
by other
companies.
We
provide
a
reconciliation
of non-GAAP
measures
to the
comparable
GAAP
measures
on pages 18 and 19.
The non-GAAP
measures
used in this
presentation include
the
following:
Net Free Cash Flow
,
defined
as Free Cash Flow
(defined
below) less the
Primary
Uses of Cash
(defined
below). Net Free Cash Flow is one of the
metrics
used by us to
assess
our
sources
and uses of cash and was
derived
from our
consolidated statements
of cash flows. We
believe
that this
presentation
is
meaningful
for
understanding
our
primary sources
and
primary
uses of that cash flow.
Free Cash Flow,
defined
as net
income
plus
depreciation, amortization,
share based
compensation expense
and gain on
remeasurement
of equity
interest
in
affiliates
less other non-cash items to
reconcile
to net cash
provided
by
operating activities.
Primary
Uses of Cash
,
defined
as
dividends
to
common shareholders, dividends
paid to
noncontrolling interest shareholders,
capital
expenditures,
cash paid on
acquisitions, payments
for
additional interest
in
controlled subsidiaries
and stock
repurchases,
net of the
proceeds
and
excess
tax benefit from our stock plans, and
excludes changes
in
working
capital and other
investing
and
financing activities, including commercial
paper
issuances
and
redemptions
used to fund
working
capital
changes.
EBITDA
,
defined
as
operating income
before
interest,
taxes,
depreciation
and
amortization.
We
believe EBITDA
is more
meaningful
for
purposes
of this
analysis because
the
financial covenants
in our credit
facilities
are based on
EBITDA.
EBITA
,
defined
as
operating income
before
interest,
taxes and
amortization.
We use EBITA as an
additional operating performance measure,
which
excludes acquisition
-
related amortization expense, because
we
believe
that EBITA is a useful
measure
to
evaluate
the
performance
of our
businesses.
Net Debt,
defined
as total debt less cash, cash
equivalents
and short-term
investments.
We
believe
net debt,
together
with the
comparable
GAAP
measures, reflects
one of the
metrics
used by us to
assess
our cash
management.
, defined as operating income less income taxes calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period.
