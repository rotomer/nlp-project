(a) In the first quarter of 2011, we recorded an aggregate pre-tax charge of $7.9 million, consisting of a gain of $123.4 million related to a non-cash remeasurement gain, and repositioning charges of $131.3 million. The tax effect of these items was a net benefit of $36.7 million. This was partially offset by a tax charge of $9.0 million related to a tax accrual recorded in accordance with ASC 740 (FIN 48) during the first quarter of 2011. The after-tax effect of these items increased Net Income by $19.8 million and reduced our effective tax rate.

$ %  $ % 
Prior Period Revenue $3,487.4 $6,638.8
Foreign Exchange (FX) Impact (a) (130.4) -3.7% (166.5) -2.5%
Acquisition/Disposition Revenue (b) 25.3 0.7% 56.4 0.9%
Organic Revenue (c) 178.7 5.1% 339.5 5.1%
Current Period Revenue $3,561.0 2.1% $6,868.2 3.5%
(a) To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue. The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency. (b) Acquisition/Disposition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c) Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.
