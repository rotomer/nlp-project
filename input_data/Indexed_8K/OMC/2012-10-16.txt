The tax effect of these items was a net benefit of $36.7 million. This was partially offset by a tax charge of $9.0 million related to a tax accrual recorded in accordance with ASC 740 (FIN 48) during the first quarter of 2011. The after-tax effect of these items increased Net Income by $19.8 million and reduced our effective tax rate.

Current Period Revenue $ 3,406.6 0.8% $ 10,274.8 2.5%
(a) To calculate the FX impact, we first convert the current period's local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at constant currency revenue. The FX impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency.
(b) Acquisition/Disposition revenue is the aggregate of the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period.
(c) Organic revenue is calculated by subtracting both the acquisition revenue and the FX impact from total revenue growth.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain of the statements in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, from time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. These statements relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks and other factors that may cause our actual or our industry's results, levels of activity or achievement to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, including those that are described in our 2011 Annual Report of Form 10-K under Item 1A - Risk Factors and Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, include, but are not limited to, our future financial position and results of operations, global economic conditions and conditions in the credit markets, losses on media purchases and production costs incurred on behalf of clients, reductions in client spending and/or a slowdown in client payments, competitive factors, changes in client communication requirements, managing conflicts of interest, the hiring and retention of personnel, maintaining a highly skilled workforce, our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients, reliance on information technology systems, changes in government regulations impacting our advertising and marketing strategies, risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our critical accounting estimates and legal proceedings, and our international operations, which are subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "would," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are our present expectations. Actual events or results may differ. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and adjustments to the GAAP presentation ("Non-GAAP"), which we believe are meaningful for understanding our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures on pages 20 and 21.
The non-GAAP measures used in this presentation include the following:
Net Free Cash Flow, defined as Free Cash Flow (defined below) less the Primary Uses of Cash (defined below). Net Free Cash Flow is one of the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow. Free Cash Flow, defined as net income plus depreciation, amortization, share based compensation expense and gain on re-measurement of equity interest in affiliates less other non-cash items to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities. Primary Uses of Cash, defined as dividends to common shareholders, dividends paid to non-controlling interest shareholders, capital expenditures, cash paid on acquisitions, payments for additional interest in controlled subsidiaries and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds and excess tax benefit from our stock plans, and excludes changes in working capital and other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions used to fund working capital changes.
EBITDA, defined as operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is meaningful because the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based on EBITDA.
EBITA, defined as operating income before interest, taxes and amortization. We use EBITA as an additional operating performance measure, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, because we believe that EBITA is a useful measure to evaluate the performance of our businesses.
Net Debt, defined as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe net debt, together with the comparable GAAP measures, reflects one of the metrics used by us to assess our cash management.
After Tax Operating Income, defined as operating income less income taxes calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period.
