Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
On January 31, 2006, at the special meeting of the stockholders of Siebel Systems, Inc. ("Siebel Systems"), the Siebel Systems stockholders adopted the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 12, 2005, as amended, by and among Oracle Systems Corporation (formerly named Oracle Corporation and referred to herein as "Oracle Systems"), Siebel Systems, Oracle Corporation (formerly named Ozark Holding Inc. and referred to herein as "Oracle"), Ozark Merger Sub Inc. ("Oracle Merger Sub") and Sierra Merger Sub Inc. ("Siebel Merger Sub").
 
Subsequent to the special meeting, on January 31, 2006, Siebel Merger Sub (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle) merged with and into Siebel Systems (the "Siebel Systems Merger") and Oracle Merger Sub (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle) merged with and into Oracle Systems (the "Oracle Merger" and, together with the Siebel Systems Merger, the "Mergers"). As a result of the Mergers, each of Oracle Systems and Siebel Systems became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle.
 
Former Siebel Systems stockholders electing to receive Oracle common stock will receive a combination of stock and cash because holders of approximately 32.68% of Siebel Systems common stock elected to receive Oracle common stock. Therefore, the stock portion of the consideration was oversubscribed pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. As a result, these electing stockholders will receive approximately $0.8752 in cash and 0.7888 shares of Oracle common stock for each Siebel Systems share. Any fractional shares remaining after conversion will be converted into cash at $12.61 per share, the closing price of Oracle Systems common stock on the day prior to the closing of the Mergers. Former Siebel Systems stockholders not electing to receive Oracle common stock will receive $10.66 per share in cash. The aggregate consideration payable to former Siebel Systems stockholders consists of approximately $4.1 billion in cash and approximately 140.7 million shares of Oracle common stock. Oracle intends to repurchase shares in the marketplace equal to the amount issued effectively making the acquisition a cash transaction from Oracle's perspective.
 
In the Oracle Merger, each share of Oracle Systems common stock was automatically converted into one share of Oracle common stock.
 
The issuance of the Oracle common stock pursuant to the Siebel Systems Merger was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Oracle's registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-129139) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
 
The definitive proxy statement/prospectus of Oracle and Siebel Systems, dated December 29, 2005, which forms a part of the Registration Statement contains additional information about the Mergers, including information concerning the interests of directors, executive officers and affiliates of Siebel Systems in the Siebel Systems Merger.
 
Prior to the Mergers, Oracle Systems common stock and Siebel Systems common stock were both registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market. As a result of the Mergers, Oracle Systems common stock and Siebel Systems common stock have ceased trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Each of Oracle Systems and Siebel Systems has filed a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of its common stock under the Exchange Act.
 
On January 31, 2006, Oracle entered into a Preferred Share Rights Agreement with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, with the same terms and conditions (including the expiration date of March 31, 2008) as the Amended and Restated Preferred Share Rights Agreement of Oracle Systems and BankBoston N.A., as rights agent, dated March 31, 1998, as amended.
 
Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under Exchange Act, the Oracle common stock and the associated preferred share purchase rights are deemed to be registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The Oracle common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol "ORCL".
 
Upon consummation of the Oracle Merger, all of the officers and directors of Oracle Systems immediately before such merger became the officers and directors of Oracle, and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Oracle were amended and restated in their entirety to be substantially identical to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Oracle Systems in effect immediately prior to the Oracle Merger. In addition, Oracle assumed the employee compensation plans and arrangements of Oracle Systems.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On January 31, 2006, Oracle issued a press release announcing that the Siebel Systems stockholders had adopted the Merger Agreement and that the Mergers had been completed. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Dividends and Distributions
 
(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any other stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount (if any) per share (rounded to the nearest cent), subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock of the Corporation or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).
 
(C) Dividends due pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case
 
dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
 
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.

(B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
 
(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; or
 
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock.

Section 6. .
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
 
(A) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Corporation to the holders of Common Stock, the amount of $1,000.00 per share for each share of Series A Preferred Stock then held by them. Thereafter, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such
 
event under the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) If the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the full preferential amount set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (A) above, then the entire assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be distributed among such holders in proportion to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then held by them.
 
(C) The foregoing rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up provided o the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the rights of the holders of any other series of Preferred Stock (or any other stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
 
Section 7. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Such dividends shall be payable in arrears in equal amounts quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year (unless such day is not a business day, in which event on the next succeeding business day) (each of such dates being a "Dividend Payment Date" and each such quarterly period being a "Dividend Period"). Such dividends shall be cumulative from the date of issue, whether or not funds of the Corporation are legally available for the payment of such dividends. Each such dividend shall be payable to the holders of record of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, as they appear on the Corporation's stock register at the close of business on such record dates, which record dates shall be not more than 60 days or less than 10 days prior to the respective Dividend Payment Date, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors.

Dividends
 
(b) The amount of dividends payable for each full Dividend Period for the Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed by dividing the annual dividend rate by four. The amount of dividends payable for the initial Dividend Period, or any other period shorter or longer than a full Dividend Period, on the Series C Preferred Stock shall be computed on the basis of 30-day months and a 12-month year. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on the Series C Preferred Stock. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series C Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.
 
(c) So long as any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set apart for payment any dividends or distributions on Parity Securities, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series C Preferred Stock for all Dividend Periods terminating on or before the date of payment of the dividend on such Parity Securities. If dividends are not paid in full or a sum sufficient for such payment is not set apart, all dividends declared upon shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and all dividends declared upon any other Parity Securities shall be declared ratably in proportion to the respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid on the Series C Preferred Stock and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Securities.
 
(d) So long as any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, declare, pay or
 
set apart for payment any dividends or other distributions on Junior Securities (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Junior Securities) or redeem or otherwise acquire any Junior Securities (other than a redemption or acquisition of shares of Common Stock made for purposes of an employee incentive or benefit plan of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) (all such dividends, distributions, redemptions or acquisitions being a "Junior Securities Distribution") for any consideration (including any moneys to be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock), except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Securities, unless in each case the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and any other Parity Securities have been paid or set apart for payment for all past and current Dividend Periods with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock and all past and current dividend periods with respect to such Parity Securities.
 
Section 4. . (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the Corporation's assets (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Securities, holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive $261,500 per share of Series C Preferred Stock plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, the Corporation's assets, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series C Preferred Stock are insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any Parity Securities, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series C Preferred Stock and any other Parity Securities ratably in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any such other Parity Securities if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with, or a conversion of the Corporation into, one or more corporations, or (ii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets, shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Corporation.
Liquidation Preference
 
(b) Subject to the rights of the holders of any Parity Securities, after payment has been made in full to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, as provided in this Section 4, holders of Junior Securities shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.
 
Section 5. . (a) The Series C Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable by the Corporation prior to February 2, 2026 (such date, the "Redemption Date"). On and after the Redemption Date, to the extent the Corporation has funds legally available for such payment, the Corporation may redeem at its option shares of Series C Preferred Stock, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price of $261,500 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the redemption date, in cash without interest.
Redemption
 
(b) Shares of Series C Preferred Stock that have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Delaware) have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the class of Preferred Stock undesignated as to Series and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of the Preferred Stock.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, unless full cumulative cash dividends (whether or not declared) on all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been paid or contemporaneously are declared and paid or set apart for payment for all dividend periods terminating on or before the applicable redemption date, none of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be redeemed, and no sum shall be set aside for such redemption, unless shares of Series C Preferred Stock are redeemed pro rata.
 
Section 6. . (a) If fewer than all the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or pro rata (with any fractional shares being rounded to the nearest whole share) as may be determined by the Board of Directors (subject to Section 5(c)).
Procedure for Redemption
 
(b) If the Corporation redeems shares of Series C Preferred Stock, notice of such redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the redemption date, to each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed at such holder's address as the same appears on the Corporation's stock register; that neither the failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the validity of the giving of such notice except as to the holder to whom the Corporation has failed to give said notice or whose notice was defective. Each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date.
provided
 
(c) Notice having been mailed as aforesaid, from and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation defaults in providing money for the payment of the redemption price of the shares called for redemption), dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and all rights of the holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive from the Corporation the redemption price) shall cease. Upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any shares so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be redeemed by the Corporation at the redemption price aforesaid. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without cost to the holder thereof.
 
Section 7. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to (i) vote with the holders of Common Stock in each election of directors of the Corporation submitted for a vote of holders of Common Stock, (ii) 17,000 votes per share of Series C Preferred Stock and (iii) notice of any stockholders' meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Corporation. If the Corporation at any time after the date of issuance of the Series C Preferred
Voting Rights.
 
Stock pays any dividend on Common Stock in shares of Common Stock or effects a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes to which holders of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under Section 7(a)(ii) shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(b) The consent or votes required in Section 7(a) shall be in addition to any approval of stockholders of the Corporation which may be required by law or pursuant to any provision of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, which approval shall be obtained by vote of the stockholders of the Corporation in the manner provided in Section 7(a).
 
(c) Except as otherwise required by applicable law or as set forth herein, the shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights and powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action.
 
Section 8. . (a) The term "Person" as used herein means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, organization, association, other entity or individual.
General Provisions
 
(b) The term "outstanding", when used with reference to shares of stock in this Section C, shall mean issued shares, excluding shares held by the Corporation.
 
(c) Each holder of Series C Preferred Stock, by acceptance thereof, acknowledges and agrees that payments of dividends, interest, premium and principal on, and exchange, redemption and repurchase of, such securities by the Corporation are subject to restrictions on the Corporation contained in certain credit and financing agreements.
 
 
The stockholders of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the Corporation, except Bylaws adopted by the shareholders that specify that they cannot be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.
 
 
Election of Directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.
 
 
A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
 
If the Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article 7 by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

Section 1.01. . An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors shall each year fix. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
Annual Meetings
 
Section 1.02. . Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of Directors or stockholders holding shares representing not less than twenty percent of the outstanding votes entitled to vote at the meeting. Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.
Special Meetings
 
Section 1.03. . Written notice of all meetings of stockholders shall be given stating the place, date and time of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, such notice shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
Notice of Meetings
 
Section 1.04. . Any meeting of stockholders may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or another place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Adjournments
 
Section 1.05. . At each meeting of stockholders the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum, except where otherwise required by law. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting may adjourn the meeting. Shares of the Corporation's stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any other corporation to vote any of the Corporation's stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Quorum
 
Section 1.06. . Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by such person as the Board of Directors may designate, or, in the absence of such a person, the Chairman of the Board, or, in the absence of such person, the President of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. Such person shall be chairman of the meeting and shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section 1.07. . Unless otherwise provided by law, and subject to the provisions of Section 1.6 of these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
Voting; Proxies
such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless such is demanded by a stockholder or stockholders holding shares representing at least one percent of the votes entitled to vote at such meeting, or by such stockholder's or stockholders' proxy. If a vote is to be taken by written ballot, each such ballot shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as the chairman of the meeting deems appropriate, and the ballots shall be counted by one or more inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting. At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other elections and questions, unless otherwise provided by law or these Bylaws, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at the meeting.
 
Section 1.08. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, then the record date shall be as provided by law. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Fixing Date For Determination of Stockholders of Record
 
Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date for such consent. Such request shall include a brief description of the action proposed to be taken. The Board of Directors shall, within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. Such record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
Section 1.09. . A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, and except as set forth in Section 1.8 above, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Certain Definitions
 
(a) "" shall mean any Person who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person either (i) as the result of the acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of Common Shares beneficially owned by such Person to 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; provided, however, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding by reason of share purchases by
Acquiring Person
the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Shares in Common Shares or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares), then such Person shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person; or (ii) (x) if a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it beneficially owned a percentage of the Common Shares that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of the Common Shares it beneficially owned but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such beneficial ownership under this Agreement) and without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Company, and (y) if such Person divested or divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing,
 
(1) Lawrence J.

Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made.

(a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Rights Certificates that evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, at
 
the election of the Company, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable, as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d) of this Agreement.

In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieths of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Rights Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a Common Share.

(e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery of this Agreement (except the due execution of this Agreement by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates after receipt by the Rights Agent of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12 describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.

The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.

(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Preferred Shares and the Common Shares.

(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights, evidence of which shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price.

Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 of this Agreement, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.

Exchange
 
(a) Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, and subject to subsection (c) below, the Company may, at its option, by majority vote of the Board of Directors, at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) of this Agreement) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of this Agreement (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.

(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Ratio of Exchange. The Company shall give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) of this Agreement) held by each holder of Rights.

(c) In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with Section 24(a), the Company shall either take such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights or alternatively, at the option of a majority of the Board of Directors, with respect to each Right (i) pay cash in an amount equal to the Current Value (as hereinafter defined), in lieu of issuing Common Shares in exchange therefor, or (ii) issue debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, having a value equal to the Current Value, in lieu of issuing Common Shares in exchange for each such Right, where the value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors by majority vote of the Board of Directors, or (iii) deliver any combination of cash, property, Common Shares and/or other securities having a value equal to the Current Value in exchange for each Right. For purposes of this Section 24(c) only, the Current Value shall mean the product of the current per share market price of Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described above in subparagraph (a)) multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Right otherwise would be exchangeable if there were sufficient shares available. To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 24(c), the Board of Directors may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to sixty (60) days following the date on which the event described in Section 24(a) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended.
 
(d) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates that evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current per share market value of a whole Common Share (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) of this Agreement).
 
(e) The Company may, at its option, by majority vote of the Board of Directors, at any time before any Person has become an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding Rights for rights of substantially equivalent value, as determined reasonably and with good faith by the Board of Directors, based upon the advice of one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms.
 
(f) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of rights in exchange therefor as has been determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with subsection (e) above. The Company shall give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Oracle Corporation (the "Company"), Oracle Systems Corporation ("Old Oracle"), Siebel Systems, Inc., Ozark Merger Sub Inc. and Sierra Merger Sub Inc., dated as of September 12, 2005, as amended, the Company entered into a rights agreement with substantially identical terms and conditions as Old Oracle's Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement dated as of March 31, 1998, as amended. On January 31, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend was paid to stockholders of record on January 31, 2006 (the "Record Date"). As of the date hereof, if certain events related to an unsolicited takeover attempt occur, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company, at a price of $125.00 per one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in an Preferred Shares Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, dated as of January 31, 2006.
 
Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 days (or such later date as may be determined by action of a majority of the Company's Directors) following a public announcement that a person, or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "Acquiring Person"), has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (the date of such announcement being the "Shares Acquisition Date") or (ii) 10 days (or such later date as may be determined by action of a majority of the Company's Directors) following the date that a tender offer or exchange offer is first published or sent, the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of such outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced by such Common Share certificates and no separate Rights Certificates will be distributed.
 
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares, even without such notation or a copy of the Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights Agreement provides that Lawrence J. Ellison and his affiliates, associates and successors, certain successors thereto, or any other transferee approved by the Company's Board of Directors shall not be or become an Acquiring Person on account of the beneficial ownership of Common Shares of the Company by any of them, so long as Ellison and his affiliates, associates and successors, certain successors thereto, or any other transferee approved by the Company's Board of Directors, do not acquire from any third party other than the Company, in the aggregate, beneficial ownership of more than an additional 1% of the Company's Common Shares.
 
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on March 31, 2008 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, in each case, as described below.
 
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or Preferred Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Common Shares or Preferred Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Common Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
The number of Rights associated with each Common Share and the rights associated with each Preferred Share are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
 
Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable and are junior to any other series of preferred stock the Company may issue (unless otherwise provided in the terms of such stock). Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a quarterly dividend payment of 10,125 times the dividend declared per Common Share. In the event of liquidation, each Preferred Share will be entitled to a $10,125.00 preference, and thereafter the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 10,125 times the aggregate payment made per Common Share. Each Preferred Share will have 10,125 votes, voting together with the Common Shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 10,125 times the amount received per Common Share. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
Because of the nature of the Preferred Shares' dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieth interest in a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one and one-half Common Shares.
 
In the event that, after the Shares Acquisition Date, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person, will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. If the Company does not have authorized but unissued Common Shares sufficient to satisfy such obligation to issue Common Shares, the Company is obligated to deliver upon payment of the exercise price of a Right an amount of cash or other securities equivalent in value to the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of a Right.
 
At any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, by a majority vote of the Board of Directors, the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which have become void), in whole or in part, for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one and one-half Common Shares per Right (subject to adjustment).
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. At the election of the Company, no fractional Preferred Shares will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of the one-six thousand seven hundred fiftieths of a Preferred Share) and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
 
At any time prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth day following the Shares Acquisition Date, or such later date as may be determined by a majority of the Company's Directors, and (ii) the expiration date of the Rights, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.000148 per Right (the "Redemption Price"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.
The terms of the Rights may be amended in any respect by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights, except that, from and after the Distribution Date, no such amendments shall be made without the approval of the holders of the Rights other than amendments made to (i) cure ambiguities, (ii) correct or supplement provisions that may be defective or inconsistent with other provisions of the Rights Agreement, (iii) shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement, or (iv) change or supplement the provisions of the Rights Agreement in any manner the Company may deem necessary provided that such change or supplement does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights (other than an Acquiring Person). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of the Rights may not be supplemented or amended from and after the Distribution Date to lengthen a time period relating to when the Rights may be redeemed at a time when the Rights are not by their terms redeemable or lengthen any other time period unless such lengthening is for the purpose of protecting, enhancing or clarifying the rights of, and/or the benefits to, the holders of the Rights.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. A copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is hereby incorporated herein by refer

REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., 31-JAN-2006 Oracle Corporation announced today the completion of its acquisition of Siebel Systems, Inc.
 
"Oracle is now the undisputed leader in Customer Relationship Management software," said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "Oracle's focus on modern, standards-based applications and middleware is moving us into a leadership position in applications and on-demand services. Siebel accelerates that move."
 
"Siebel's expertise with industry-specific customer-facing applications combined with rich analytics will not only serve as the centerpiece of our CRM strategy for Oracle Fusion Applications, but can also be used to extend our current customers investments today," said Oracle President Charles Phillips.
 
Former Siebel stockholders electing to receive Oracle common stock will receive a combination of stock and cash because the stock portion of the consideration was oversubscribed. The pro rata allocation of cash and stock payable to the electing holders will be announced following receipt of the final election results, which are expected to be available on or about February 2, 2006. Former Siebel stockholders not electing to receive Oracle common stock will receive $10.66 per share in cash. Oracle intends to repurchase shares in the marketplace equal to the amount issued effectively making it a cash transaction.
 
Oracle will host a conference call on Thursday, February 9, at 2:00 p.m. PST / 5:00 p.m. EST to discuss preliminary guidance for the combined companies. A live audio webcast of the call will be made available on the Oracle Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor. The webcast will be available for replay for seven days following the conference call.
