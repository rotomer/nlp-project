REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., December 18, 2006  Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ-GS: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2007 Q2 GAAP earnings per share were up 20% to $0.18, compared to the same quarter last year. Second quarter total GAAP revenues were up 26% to $4.2 billion, while quarterly GAAP net income was up 21% to $967 million. Total GAAP software revenues were up 23% to $3.2 billion with database and middleware new license revenues up 9% and applications new license revenues up 28%. Services revenues were up 41% to $949 million, compared to the same quarter last year.
 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were up 18% to $0.22, and non-GAAP net income was up 20% to $1.17 billion, compared to the same quarter last year.
 
"We delivered strong top line revenue growth along with solid earnings for the second quarter," said Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz. "We are now halfway through our five year plan targeting EPS growth at 20% per year. For the first two-and-a-half years we are comfortably ahead of that target."
 
"We continue to gain market share in applications from SAP, in middleware from BEA, and in database from IBM," said Oracle President, Charles Phillips. "In Q2 our middleware new license growth was exceptionally strong. We expect to pass BEA in total middleware new license sales later this year."
"Our applications acquisition strategy has strengthened our competitiveness in several industries including retail, banking, telecommunications and utilities," said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. "Now, the very first industry vertical we entered via acquisition, our retail software business, is beginning to see the benefits of operational integration with Oracle. In Q2, our retail new software license sales more than tripled. During the second half of the year the retail business unit expects to do even better. Eight of the top ten retailers in North America use Oracle retail software, only one uses SAP."

Statements in this press release relating to Oracle's future plans and prospects are "forward-looking statements" and are subject to material risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect our current expectations and our actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations: (1) Economic, political and market conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability through reductions in IT budgets and expenditures. (2) We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to such factors as delays or size reductions in transactions, fewer large transactions in a particular quarter, unanticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates, delays in delivery of new products or releases, or a decline in our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. (3) We cannot assure market acceptance of new products or new versions of existing products. (4) We have an active acquisition program, and our acquisitions may not be successful, may involve unanticipated costs or other integration issues, or may disrupt our existing operations. (5) Periodic changes to our pricing model and sales organization could temporarily disrupt operations and cause a decline or delay in sales. (6) Intense competitive forces demand rapid technological advances and frequent new product introductions, and could require us to reduce prices. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading "Risk Factors." Copies of these filings are available online from the SEC or by contacting Oracle Corporation's Investor Relations Department at (650) 506-4073 or by clicking on SEC Filings on Oracle's Investor Relations website at http://www.oracle.com/investor. All information set forth in this release is current as of December 18, 2006. Oracle undertakes no duty to update any statement in light of new information or future events.

APPENDIX A
 
 
 
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the table, which exclude certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions as well as other significant expenses including stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effect:
