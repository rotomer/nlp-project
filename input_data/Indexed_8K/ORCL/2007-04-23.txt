Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
On April 19, 2007, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 28, 2007 (the Merger Agreement) by and among Oracle Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Oracle), Hotrod Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle (Merger Subsidiary), and Hyperion Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Hyperion), Oracle completed its acquisition of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Hyperion (the Hyperion Shares). Oracles acquisition of the Hyperion Shares was structured as a two-step transaction, with a cash tender offer by Merger Subsidiary for the Hyperion Shares (the Offer) followed by the merger of Merger Subsidiary with and into Hyperion (the Merger), with Hyperion becoming the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle.
The initial offering period of the Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Friday, April 13, 2007 (the Initial Expiration Date). On the Initial Expiration Date, Oracle and Merger Subsidiary announced a subsequent offering period expiring at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, April 18, 2007 (the Subsequent Expiration Date). According to Citibank, N.A., the depositary for the Offer, as of the Subsequent Expiration Date, a total of 55,703,835 Hyperion Shares were validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn, which represented approximately 91.3% of all the outstanding Hyperion Shares. Oracle accepted for payment and promptly paid the offer price of $52.00 per share in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes to all Hyperion stockholders who validly tendered and did not withdraw Hyperion Shares pursuant to the Offer.
Following the Initial Expiration Date, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Oracle designated six representatives to serve on Hyperions Board of Directors, replacing Hyperion Board members who resigned at that time and giving Oracle majority representation on Hyperions Board of Directors. Two of the previously elected Hyperion Board members remained on the Hyperion Board until the Merger was completed.
On April 19, 2007, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary was merged with and into Hyperion, and each outstanding Hyperion Share not tendered in the Offer (other than restricted shares, shares held by Oracle, Hyperion or any of their respective subsidiaries, or shares held by stockholders who properly perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law) were converted into the right to receive $52.00 per share in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes. Upon the consummation of the Merger, Hyperion survived and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle.
