This is one of the Notes of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: May 15, 2007
 
 
Oracle Corporation (the "") promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum described above. Cash interest on the Notes will accrue from May 15, 2007, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which payment has been paid or provided for; provided, that if an Interest Payment Date for this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, unless such next succeeding Business Day would be in the following month, in which case the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest on this Note will be paid to but excluding the relevant Interest Payment Date. The Issuer will pay interest quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing August 14, 2007. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in an interest period and a 360-day year.
Issuer
The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate borne by the Notes and on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) to the extent lawful.
The interest rate for each interest period will be determined by the calculation agent. Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. will act as calculation agent. The Issuer may change any calculation agent without notice to the Holders. The interest rate for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month USD LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.02%. The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding such interest period.
A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
On any interest determination date, USD LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date. If, on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" as of 11:00 a.m. (London time), or if the "Reuters Page LIBOR01" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page "BBAM."
If no offered rate appears on "Reuters Page LIBOR01" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Issuer) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, USD LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, USD LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the rate of USD LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of USD LIBOR for the then current interest period.
Upon request from any Holder, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
Initially, The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (the "") will act as paying agent. The Issuer may change any paying agent without notice to the Holders.

This Note is one of the Floating Rate Notes due May 14, 2009 (the "") issued under an indenture dated as of January 13, 2006 (the "") by and among the Issuer (formerly known as Ozark Holding Inc.), Oracle Systems Corporation (formerly known as Oracle Corporation) and Citibank, N.A.

Indenture
For purposes of this Note, unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) (the "") as in effect on the date on which the Indenture was qualified under the TIA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Notes are subject to all such terms, and holders of Notes are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of them. To the extent the terms of the Indenture and this Note are inconsistent, the terms of the Indenture shall govern.
TIA
 
The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 thereafter. A Holder shall register the transfer or exchange of Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Issuer may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as permitted by the Indenture.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes and the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Notes may be amended or supplemented and any existing default or Event of Default or compliance with certain provisions may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all series of Outstanding Securities (including the Notes) under the Indenture that are affected by such amendment, supplement or waiver (voting as a single class). Without notice to or consent of any Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Note.
 
If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any. If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes will
automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires. The Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Note or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Notes and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
 
The laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and this Note thereof.
