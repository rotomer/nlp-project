Item 8.01 Other Events
Oracle Corporation today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $8.0 billion of common stock under its share repurchase program. With this increase, the Company currently has authorization to repurchase approximately $9.3 billion of common stock. Oracle intends to use the additional authorization to repurchase its shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under Oracle's stock option and employee stock purchase plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment or repurchase of debt, stock price, and economic and market conditions. Stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and/or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
