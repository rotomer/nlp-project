Section 2  Financial Information
 
On May 12, 2010, Oracle Corporation issued a total of $800 million of short-term promissory notes (the "New CP Notes") under its $3.0 billion commercial paper program. The maturities of the New CP Notes are between one month and two months. The weighted average yield of the New CP Notes, including issuance costs, is 0.285%.
In addition to the New CP Notes, we also have $281.3 million of short-term promissory notes (the "Existing CP Notes" and together with the New CP Notes, the "CP Notes") outstanding which were issued in early calendar 2010 pursuant to our commercial paper program. The maturities of the Existing CP Notes are between four months and five months. The weighted average yield of the Existing CP Notes, including issuance costs, is 0.209%.
We have approximately $1.9 billion of capacity remaining under our $3.0 commercial paper program. We reduced the overall capacity of our commercial paper program from $5.0 billion to $3.0 billion after our March 2009 $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility terminated pursuant to its terms in March 2010.
The CP Notes are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are unsecured and rank with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The CP Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment.
pari passu
We expect to use the funds from the New CP Notes, along with our internally available cash, to repay $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes due May 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
