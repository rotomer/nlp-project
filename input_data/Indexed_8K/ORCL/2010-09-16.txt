REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., September 16, 2010  Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2011 Q1 GAAP total revenues were up 48% to $7.5 billion, while non-GAAP total revenues were up 50% to $7.6 billion. GAAP new software license revenues were up 25% to $1.3 billion. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP software license updates and product support revenues were up 11% to $3.5 billion. GAAP operating income was up 10% to $1.9 billion, and GAAP operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was up 27% to $2.9 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. GAAP net income was up 20% to $1.4 billion, while non-GAAP net income was up 38% to $2.1 billion. GAAP earnings per share were $0.27, up 20% compared to last year while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 38% to $0.42. GAAP operating cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was $8.8 billion.
"We executed better than expected on both the top and bottom line for the quarter," said Oracle CFO, Jeff Epstein. "Strong revenue performance plus disciplined business management enabled a 38% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.42."
"Our software business grew strongly in all regions with new license sales up 25%," said Oracle President, Safra Catz. "Our hardware business also grew faster than we expected with Sun Solaris servers and Exadata leading the way."
"Next week at Oracle OpenWorld we will announce two new high-end systems that combine Sun hardware with Oracle software," said Oracle President, Mark Hurd. "We will invest over $4 billion in research and development this year, so our already robust product portfolio is only going to get stronger."
"Our Exadata database machine continued to win new customers in Q1," said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. "The worldwide Exadata pipeline now exceeds $1.5 billion for the full fiscal year."
In addition, Oracle's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 6, 2010, with a payment date of November 3, 2010.

Statements in this press release relating to Oracle's or its Board of Directors' future plans, expectations, beliefs, intentions and prospects are "forward-looking statements" and are subject to material risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect our current expectations and our actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations: (1) Economic, political and market conditions, including the recent recession and global economic crisis, can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. (2) We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to such factors as delays or size reductions in transactions, fewer large transactions in a particular quarter, unanticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. (3) Our entrance into the hardware systems business may not be successful, and we may fail to achieve our financial forecasts with respect to this new business. (4) We have an active acquisition program and our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Sun Microsystems, may not be successful, may involve unanticipated costs or other integration issues or may disrupt our existing operations. (5) Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results, including risks relating to foreign currency gains and losses and risks relating to compliance with international and U.S. laws that apply to our international operations. (6) Intense competitive forces demand rapid technological advances and frequent new product introductions and could require us to reduce prices or cause us to lose customers. (7) If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or hardware systems products or purchase or renew support contracts. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading "Risk Factors." Copies of these filings are available online from the SEC or by contacting Oracle Corporation's Investor Relations Department at (650) 506-4073 or by clicking on SEC Filings on Oracle's Investor Relations website at http://www.oracle.com/investor. All information set forth in this press release is current as of September 16, 2010. Oracle undertakes no duty to update any statement in light of new information or future events.

APPENDIX A
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we use the non-GAAP measures indicated in the tables, which exclude certain business combination accounting entries and expenses related to acquisitions, as well as other significant expenses including stock-based compensation, that we believe are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:
