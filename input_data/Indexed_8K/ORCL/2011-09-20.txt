Both GAAP and non-GAAP new software license revenues were up 17% to $1.5 billion. GAAP software license updates and product support revenues were up 17% to $4.0 billion, while non-GAAP software license updates and product support revenues were up 16% to $4.0 billion.

REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., Sept. 20, 2011
"New software license sales grew 17%," said Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz. "This strong organic growth coupled with disciplined business management enabled yet another increase in our operating margin in Q1. Operating cash flow increased this quarter to $5.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from $3.8 billion in Q1 of last year."
"Our high-end server business  Exadata, Exalogic, and SPARC M-Series  delivered solid double digit revenue growth in Q1," said Oracle President, Mark Hurd. "In contrast, revenue declined in our low-end server business. By moving away from low-margin commodity hardware and focusing on high-end servers, we increased our hardware gross margins from 48% to 54%. Our strategy to grow the profitable parts of our hardware business is paying off."
"Next week Oracle will announce a new high-performance SPARC microprocessor, and a new high-end server called a SPARC SuperCluster," said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. "The new SPARC T4 microprocessor is up to 5 times faster than the T3 microprocessor it replaces. The new SuperCluster is engineered to use the SPARC T4 microprocessor and the Exadata flash and disk storage system to deliver extreme record-breaking performance."
In addition, Oracle also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2011, with a payment date of November 2, 2011.

Statements in this press release relating to Oracle's future plans, expectations, beliefs, intentions and prospects, are "forward-looking statements" and are subject to material risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect our current expectations and our actual results, and could cause actual results to differ materially. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations: (1) Economic, political and market conditions, including the recent recession and global economic crisis and the current situation in Japan caused by the recent earthquake and resulting tsunami, can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. (2) We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to such factors as delays or size reductions in transactions, fewer large transactions in a particular quarter, unanticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for software license updates and product support. (3) Our hardware systems business may not be successful, and we may fail to achieve our financial forecasts with respect to this business. (4) We have an active acquisition program and our acquisitions may not be successful, may involve unanticipated costs or other integration issues or may disrupt our existing operations. (5) Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results, including risks relating to foreign currency gains and losses, risks relating to compliance with international and U.S. laws that apply to our international operations and risks to the sales of our products and services and supply chain operations caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. (6) Intense competitive forces demand rapid technological advances and frequent new product introductions and could require us to reduce prices or cause us to lose customers. (7) If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, or to enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or to position and/or price our products and services to meet market demand, customers may not buy new software licenses or hardware systems products or purchase or renew support contracts. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, particularly under the heading "Risk Factors." Copies of these filings are available online from the SEC or by contacting Oracle Corporation's Investor Relations Department at (650) 506-4073 or by clicking on SEC Filings on Oracle's Investor Relations website at http://www.oracle.com/investor.

APPENDIX A
