Product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2003, totaled $339.5 million, up 14.9% from $295.5 million for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2003 increased to $140.9 million (or 41.5% of product sales) from $126.0 million (or 42.7% of product sales) for the first quarter of 2002, representing an increase of 11.8%. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative ("OSG&A") expenses increased to $107.6 million (or 31.7% of product sales) for the first quarter 2003 from $97.4 million (or 33.0% of product sales) for the first quarter 2002. Comparable store product sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.2% and 3.6% for the first quarter of 2003 and 2002, respectively. David O'Reilly, co-chairman and chief executive officer, stated, "We are pleased with the 6.2% comparable store sales and the financial results for the quarter despite the uncertainties in the economy. Our company-wide cost control initiatives resulted in a 130 basis point drop in OSG&A expenses as a percent of product sales for the first quarter 2003 compared to 2002. Additionally, we generated $25.2 million in free cash flow [cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures] in the first quarter of 2003."
