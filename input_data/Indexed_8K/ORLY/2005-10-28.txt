________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Springfield, MO, October 25, 2005
-- O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced record revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2005, representing 48 quarters of record revenues and earnings for O'Reilly since becoming a public company in April 1993.
 
Net income for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, totaled $48.6 million, up 40.2% from $34.7 million for the same period in 2004. Diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter of 2005 increased 35.5% to $0.42 on 113.8 million shares compared to $0.31 for the third quarter of 2004 on 111.6 million shares, including a $0.05 benefit from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties. On an adjusted basis excluding the favorable tax benefit, diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter of 2005 increased 19.4% to $0.37.
 
Product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2005, totaled $542.9 million, up 19.3% from $455.2 million for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2005 increased to $235.9 million (or 43.5% of product sales) from $198.2 million (or 43.5% of product sales) for the third quarter of 2004, representing an increase of 19.0%. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative ("OSG&A") expenses increased to $168.3 million (or 31.0% of product sales) for the third quarter of 2005 from $142.0 million (or 31.2% of product sales) for the third quarter of 2004, representing an increase of 18.5%. The reduction in the effective tax rate from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2004 to 27.5% in the third quarter of 2005 reflects a one-time benefit of $6.1 million from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties.
 
Net income, before cumulative effect of accounting change, for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $124.8 million, up 30.4% from $95.7 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per common share, before cumulative effect of accounting change, for the first nine months of 2005 increased 27.9% to $1.10 on 113.2 million shares compared to $0.86 a year ago on 111.3 million shares, including a $0.05 benefit from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties. On an adjusted basis excluding the favorable tax benefit, diluted earnings per common share, before cumulative effect of accounting change, for the first nine months of 2005 increased 22.1% to $1.05.
 
Product sales for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $1.53 billion, up 18.3% from $1.29 billion for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the first nine months of 2005 increased to $661.1 million (or 43.2% of product sales) from $557.2 million (or 43.1% of product sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 18.6%. OSG&A expenses increased to $471.8 million (or 30.8% of product sales) for the first nine months of 2005 from $402.8 million (or 31.1% of product sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 17.1%. The reduction in the effective tax rate from 37.4% for the first
 
 
nine months of 2004 to 33.7% in the first nine months of 2005 reflects a one time benefit of $6.1 million from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties.
 
Comparable store product sales for stores open at least one year increased 6.1% and 7.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively.
 
"We are pleased with our overall performance this quarter as we continue to establish new records for revenues and earnings," stated Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. "Comparable store sales of 6.1% and an operating margin of 12.4% highlighted this quarter's results. We are especially pleased with the outstanding response of Team O'Reilly to the challenging circumstances brought about by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The hard work and dedication of our team members have enabled us to continue providing excellent service to our customers. Although the storm inflicted some damage to stores in the affected regions, the hurricanes had no significant effect on third quarter financial results."
 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "We opened 33 new stores this quarter and are on track for 150 new stores in 2005. Also, we have continued to successfully integrate Midwest Auto Parts into our operations."
 
The Company will host a conference call Wednesday, October 26, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. central time to discuss its results, as well as future expectations. Interested parties may listen to the conference call live on the Company's website,

This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. The Company reports both GAAP and adjusted income and earnings per share amounts and comparisons to reflect what it believes are ongoing and/or comparable operating results excluding the one-time, non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter of 2005. The Company excludes this item in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
