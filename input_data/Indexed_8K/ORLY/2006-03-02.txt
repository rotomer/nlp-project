Springfield, MO, February 28, 2006
-- O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced record revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005, representing 13 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store product sales increases for O'Reilly since becoming a public company in April 1993.
 
Income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended December 31, 2005, totaled $164.3 million, up 39.6% from $117.7 million for the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per common share, before the cumulative effect of accounting change, for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased 38.1% to $1.45 on 113.4 million shares versus $1.05 a year ago on 111.4 million shares. This improvement includes a benefit of $0.05 per share from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties in the third quarter of 2005 and an adverse impact of $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter 2005 charge for the acceleration of stock options. Diluted earnings per common share in 2004 included an adverse impact of $0.04 per share for lease accounting corrections related to prior years. On an adjusted basis excluding the third quarter 2005 tax resolution benefit, the fourth quarter 2005 stock option acceleration charge and the fourth quarter 2004 lease accounting correction, diluted earnings per common share, before the cumulative effect of accounting change, increased 29.4% from $1.09 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $1.41 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
Product sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, totaled $2.05 billion, up 18.8% from $1.72 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased to $892.5 million (or 43.6% of product sales) from $743.2 million (or 43.2% of product sales) for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing an increase of 20.1%. Operating, selling, general and administrative ("OSG&A") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased to $640.0 million (or 31.3% of product sales) from $552.7 million (or 32.1% of product sales) for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing an increase of 15.8%. The reduction in the effective tax rate from 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 34.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, reflects a one-time benefit of $6.1 million from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, totaled $39.5 million, up 79.5% from $22.0 million for the same period in 2004. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 75.0% to $0.35 on 114.0 million shares compared to $0.20 for the fourth quarter of 2004 on 111.9 million shares. This improvement includes the adverse impact of $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter 2005 charge for the acceleration of stock options. Diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2004 included an adverse impact of $0.05 per share for lease accounting corrections related to prior periods. On an adjusted basis excluding the fourth quarter 2005 stock option acceleration charge and the fourth quarter 2004 lease accounting correction, diluted earnings per common share increased 44.0% from $0.25 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 to $0.36 for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.
 
Product sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, totaled $515.0 million, up 20.4% from $427.6 million for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, increased to $231.4 million (or 44.9% of product sales) from $186.0 million (or 43.5% of product sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 24.5%. OSG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased to $168.2
 
 
million (or 32.7% of product sales) from $149.9 million (or 35.1% of product sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 12.2%.
 
Comparable store product sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.4% and 7.5% for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2005, respectively, representing 51 quarters of comparable store product sales increases since O'Reilly became a public company in April 1993.
 
"We are pleased with the strong results this quarter and for the full year 2005," stated Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. "We are proud of the continued hard work and dedication of Team O'Reilly that enabled us to achieve comparable store sales growth of 7.5% while also improving our operating margin to 12.3%. This performance is the direct result of our team's commitment to providing the best possible service and selection for the professional installer and the do-it-yourself customer."
 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "In the fourth quarter of 2005, we opened 38 new stores and continued our successful integration of Midwest Auto Parts. We expect to add 170 to 175 new stores in 2006 as well as a new distribution center in Indianapolis, Indiana that will support our expansion in this region."

This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. The Company reports both GAAP and adjusted income and earnings per share amounts and comparisons to reflect what it believes are ongoing and/or comparable operating results excluding the Q4 2004 lease accounting correction, the Q3 2005 tax benefit and the Q4 2005 charge to accelerate vesting of outstanding stock options. The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
