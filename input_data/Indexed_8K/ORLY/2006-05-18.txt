TO EACH OF THE PURCHASERS LISTED IN THE
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
O'REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC., a Missouri corporation (the "Company"), agrees with you as follows:
 
 
The Company is contemplating the issue and sale of up to $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes issuable in one or more series (the "Notes", such term to include any such Notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement). The Notes will be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1 to the hereafter defined supplement, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the purchasers of such Notes, or Series thereof, and the Company. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement. The Notes may be issued in one or more series (each, a "Series" of Notes) and each Series of Notes may be issued in one or more sub-series (each, a "Sub-Series").
 
Each Series of Notes, other than the initial Series, shall be issued pursuant to a supplement to this Agreement (a "Supplement") in substantially the form of Exhibit 1.1, and shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
 
(a)
             
the designation of each Series of Notes shall distinguish the Notes of one Series from the Notes of all other Series;
(b)
             
the Notes of each Series shall rank
pari passu
with the Notes of all other Series and the Company's other outstanding unsecured Debt that has not been expressly subordinated to any other Debt of the Company (the "Senior Debt");
 
5
 
 
 
(c)
             
each Series of Notes shall be dated the date of issue, bear interest at such rate or rates, mature on such date or dates, be subject to such mandatory prepayments on the dates and with the make-whole amounts, if any, as are provided in the Supplement under which such Notes are issued, and shall have such additional or different conditions precedent to closing and such additional or different representations and warranties or other terms and provisions as shall be specified in such Supplement;
(d)
             
any additional covenants, Defaults, Events of Default, rights or other similar provisions that are added by a Supplement for the benefit of a Series of Notes to be issued pursuant to such Supplement that are more favorable to the holders of such Notes than the comparable terms applicable to any previously issued Series of Notes shall apply automatically to, and be deemed incorporated by reference in, such previously issued Series of Notes, whether or not such Supplement so provides; and
(e)
             
except to the extent provided in foregoing clauses (a) through (d) and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all of the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the Notes of each Series.
The Purchasers of the Series 2006-A Notes shall not be required to purchase subsequent Series of Notes.
 
The Company has authorized, as the initial Series of Notes hereunder, the issue and sale of (i) $75,000,000 5.39% Series 2006-A Senior Notes due May 15, 2016 (the "Series 2006-A Notes" with such term to include any such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement). The Series 2006-A Notes shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1.2, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by you and each of the other purchasers named in Schedule A and the Company. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to you and you will purchase from the Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Series 2006-A Notes in the principal amount specified opposite your name in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. Your obligation hereunder and the obligations of the other Purchasers are several and not joint obligations and you shall have no obligation hereunder and no liability to any Person for the performance or non-performance by any other Purchaser.
 
The sale and purchase of the Series 2006-A Notes to be purchased by you and the other Purchasers shall occur at the offices of Gardner Carton & Douglas LLP, 191 North Wacker

At the Closing the Company will deliver to you the Series 2006-A Notes to be purchased by you in the form of a single Series 2006-A Note (or such greater number of Series 2006-A Notes in denominations of at least $100,000 as you may request) dated the date of the Closing and registered in your name (or in the name of your nominee), against delivery by you to the Company or its order of immediately available funds in the amount of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds for the account of the Company to account number 093046020, at Commerce Bank, Springfield, Missouri, ABA#101000019, Account Name: O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Operating Account; O'Reilly Contact: Michelle Kimrey, telephone number: 417-874-7249; Bank telephone number: 417-837-5275. If at the Closing the Company shall fail to tender such Series 2006-A Notes to you as provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to your satisfaction, you shall, at your election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights you may have by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.
 
Your obligation to purchase and pay for the Series 2006-A Notes to be sold to you at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to your satisfaction, prior to or at the Closing, of the following conditions:
 
The representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be correct when made and at the time of the Closing.
 
The Company shall have performed and complied with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement required to be performed or complied with by it prior to or at the Closing and after giving effect to the issue and sale of the Series 2006-A Notes (and the application of the proceeds thereof as contemplated by Schedule 5.14) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have entered into any transaction since January 1, 2006 that would have been prohibited by Sections 10.1 through Section 10.10 hereof had such Sections applied since such date.

ii
) not violate any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and (
iii
) not subject you to any tax, penalty or liability under or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, which law or regulation was not in effect on the date hereof. If requested by you, you shall have received an Officer's Certificate certifying as to such matters of fact as you may reasonably specify to enable you to determine whether such purchase is so permitted.
 
Contemporaneously with the Closing the Company shall sell to the other Purchasers and the other Purchasers shall purchase the Series 2006-A Notes to be purchased by them at the Closing as specified in Schedule A.

Except as specified in Schedule 4.9, the Company shall not have changed its jurisdiction of incorporation or been a party to any merger or consolidation and shall not have succeeded to all or any substantial part of the liabilities of any other entity, at any time following the date of the most recent financial statements referred to in Schedule 5.5.
 
At least three Business Days prior to the date of the Closing, each Purchaser shall have received written instructions signed by a Responsible Officer on letterhead of the Company confirming the information specified in Section 3 including (i) the name and address of the transferee bank, (ii) such transferee bank's ABA number and (iii) the account name and number into which the purchase price for the Notes is to be deposited.
All corporate and other proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all documents and instruments incident to such transactions shall be satisfactory to you and your special counsel, and you and your special counsel shall have received all such counterpart originals or certified or other copies of such documents as you or they may reasonably request.
 
 
The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact and to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Series 2006-A Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.
 
This Agreement and the Series 2006-A Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each Series 2006-A Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (
i
) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
 
9
 
 
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (
ii
) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this Agreement, the documents, certificates or other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents, certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2005, there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Company that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the other documents, certificates and other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(a)
             
Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and correct lists (
i
) of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization, whether such Subsidiary is a Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary, (
ii
) of the Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries, and (
iii
) of the Company's directors and senior officers.
(b)
             
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4). Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.4, there exist no preemptive or other rights to acquire capital stock or similar equity interests of any such Subsidiary.
(c)
             
Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the
 
10
 
 
properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.
(d)
             
No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate law statutes) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of such Subsidiary.
The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).
 
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Series 2006-A Notes will not (
i
) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws, or any other Material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (
ii
) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority, including the USA Patriot Act, applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or (
iii
) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.
 
No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the Series 2006-A Notes.
 
(a)
             
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any court or
 
11
 
 
before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(b)
             
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation Environmental Laws or the USA Patriot Act) of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all required tax returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (
i
) the amount of which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (
ii
) the amount, applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate in accordance with GAAP. The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been audited and determined by the Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. The Company is currently under audit for its fiscal years ending December 31, 2002, December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004. The Company does not believe there will be any tax liability resulting from such audit which would have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries own or purport to own that individually or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date (except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all Material respects.
 
 
 
12
 
 
 
(a)
             
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries own or possess all Material licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, proprietary software, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without known Material conflict with the rights of others;
(b)
             
to the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company infringes in any Material respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, proprietary software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person; and
(c)
             
to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, proprietary software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.
(a)
             
The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate Material.
(b)
             
The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.
(c)
             
The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.
(d)
             
The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not
 
13
 
 
Material or has otherwise been disclosed in the most recent audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
(e)
             
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Series 2006-A Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Series 2006-A Notes to be purchased by you.
Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Series 2006-A Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any Person other than you, the other Purchasers and not more than two other Institutional Investors, each of which has been offered the Series 2006-A Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Series 2006-A Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
 
The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Series 2006-A Notes as set forth in Schedule 5.14. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Series 2006-A Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 1% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any present intention that margin stock will constitute more than 1% of the value of such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.
 
(a)
             
Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, since which date there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause
 
14
 
 
such Debt to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.
(b)
             
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 10.4.
(c)

The Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, Notes, in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus accrued interest to the date of prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount. The Company will give each holder of Notes written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such
 
21
 
 
prepayment. Each such notice shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date (which shall be a Business Day), the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified prepayment date.
 
In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.
 
In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.
 
The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.
 
The term "Make-Whole Amount" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal,
provided
that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:
 
22
 
 
 
"Called Principal" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
 
"Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
 
"Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, .50% over the yield to maturity implied by (
i
) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as the "PX Screen" on the Bloomberg Financial Market Service (or such other display as may replace the "PX Screen" on the Bloomberg Financial Market Service) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (
ii
) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable, the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (
a
) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (
b
) interpolating linearly between (
1
) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and greater than the Remaining Average Life and (
2
) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the duration closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.
 
"Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (
i
) such Called Principal into (
ii
) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (
a
) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (
b
) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date,
provided
that if such
 
23
 
 
Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or 12.1.
 
"Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
 
 
The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is subject, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws and the USA Patriot Act, and will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.
 
The Company will and will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times,
provided
that this Section shall not prevent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
 
24
 
 
 
The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to file all tax returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary,
provided
that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment or claims if (
i
) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (
ii
) the nonpayment of all such taxes and assessments in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.5, the Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Subsidiary) and all rights and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
The Company may designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that: (a) if such Subsidiary initially is a Restricted Subsidiary, then such Restricted Subsidiary may be subsequently redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and such Unrestricted Subsidiary may be subsequently designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, but no further changes in designation may be made; (b) if such Subsidiary initially is an Unrestricted Subsidiary, then such Unrestricted Subsidiary may be subsequently redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary and such Restricted Subsidiary may be subsequently redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, but no further changes in designation may be made; and (c) no such designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be permitted unless immediately before and after such designation there exists no Default or Event of Default.
 
 
25
 
 
 
The Company will not and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into directly or indirectly any transaction or Material group of related transactions (including without limitation the purchase, lease, sale or exchange of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate (other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary), except in the ordinary course and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Company's or such Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.
 
The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consolidate with or merge with any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets in a single transaction or series of transactions to any Person provided, however, that:
 
(a)
             
the Company may consolidate or merge with any other Person if the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor of such merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all of the assets of the Company as an entirety, as the case may be, shall be a solvent corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District of Columbia), and, if the Company is not such corporation, (i) such corporation shall have executed and delivered to each holder of any Notes its assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and the Notes, (ii) shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of any Notes an opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel, or other independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with their terms and comply with the terms hereof and (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(b)
             
Any Restricted Subsidiary may (i) merge into the Company (provided that the Company is the surviving corporation) or another Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) sell, transfer or lease all or any part of its assets to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary, or (iii) merge or consolidate with, or sell, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, any Person in a transaction that is permitted by Section 10.5 or, as a result of which, such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided
in each instance set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) that, immediately before and after giving effect thereto, there shall exist no Default or Event of Default.
No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of the Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any successor corporation that shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in this Section 10.2 from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.
 
 
26
 
 
 
(a)
             
The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of stock of any class (including as "stock" for the purposes of this section, any warrants, rights or options to purchase or otherwise acquire stock or other securities exchangeable for or convertible into stock) of such Restricted Subsidiary to any Person other than the Company or a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary, except for the purpose of qualifying directors, or except in satisfaction of the validly pre-existing preemptive or contractual rights of minority shareholders in connection with the simultaneous issuance of stock to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whereby the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary maintain their same proportionate interest in such Restricted Subsidiary or the extent required by applicable law; and
(b)
             
The Company will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of stock of any Restricted Subsidiary (except to qualify directors), and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of (except to the Company or a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary) any share of stock of any other Restricted Subsidiary, unless such sale or other disposition can be made pursuant to the requirements of Section 10.2 or of Section 10.5.
The Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not create or incur any Lien on its property except for the following:
 
(a)
             
Liens for taxes, assessments or other governmental charges which are not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith;
(b)
             
Liens incidental to the conduct of business or the ownership of properties and assets (including landlords', carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics,' materialmen's and other similar Liens) and Liens to secure the performance of bids, tenders, leases, or trade contracts, or to secure statutory obligations (including obligations under workers compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation), surety or appeal bonds or other Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business and not in connection with borrowed money;
(c)
             
Liens resulting from judgments, unless such judgments are not, within 60 days, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or shall not have been discharged within 60 days after the expiration of any such stay;
(d)
             
Liens securing Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to the Company or to another Restricted Subsidiary;
(f)
              
minor survey exceptions and the like which do not Materially detract from the value of the property subject to such exceptions;
(g)
             
leases, subleases, easements, rights-of-way, zoning restrictions or other restrictions and other similar charges or encumbrances incidental to the ownership of property or
 
27
 
 
assets or the ordinary conduct of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' businesses, provided that the aggregate of such Liens do not Materially detract from the value of property subject to such Liens;
(h)
             
Liens (i) existing on property at the time of its acquisition or construction by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof; (ii) on property created contemporaneously with its acquisition or within 180 days of the acquisition or completion of construction or improvement thereof to secure or provide for all or a portion of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement thereof; or (iii) existing on property of a Person at the time such Person is consolidated with or merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof;
provided
that in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) such Liens do not extend to additional property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than property that is an improvement to or is acquired for specific use in connection with the subject property) and, in the case of clause (ii) only, that the aggregate principal amount of Debt secured by such Lien shall not exceed the lesser of (y) the cost of acquisition or construction or (z) fair market value of such property (as determined in good faith by one or more officers of the Company to whom authority to enter into the transaction has been delegated by the board of directors);
(i)
              
any Liens renewing, extending or replacing Liens permitted by sections (d), (e), (h) and (i), provided that (A) the principal amount of the Debt secured is not increased or the maturity thereof reduced, (B) such Lien is not extended to any other property, and (C) immediately after such extension, renewal, or refunding, no Default or Event of Default would exist; and
(j)
              
Liens securing Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not otherwise permitted by paragraphs (a) through (i) above, provided that (i) Priority Debt outstanding does not exceed 20% of Consolidated Adjusted Net Worth and (ii) such Priority Debt could be incurred without violating Section 10.6 and Section 10.7.
If, notwithstanding the prohibition contained herein, the Company shall, or shall permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien, other than those Liens permitted by the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (j) of this Section 10.4, it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured equally and ratably with any and all other obligations thereby secured, such security to be pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding and, in any such case, the Notes shall have the benefit, to the fullest extent that, and with such priority as, the holders of the Notes may be entitled under applicable law, of an equitable Lien on such property. Any violation of this Section 10.4 will constitute a Default, whether or not provision is made for an equal and ratable Lien pursuant to this Section 10.4.
 
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any "substantial part" (as defined below) of the assets of the Company and
 
28
 
 
its Restricted Subsidiaries;
provided, however,
that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of assets constituting a substantial part of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries if such assets are sold in an arms length transaction and, at such time and after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and an amount equal to the net proceeds received from such sale, lease or other disposition shall be used within 180 days of such sale, lease or disposition, in any combination:
 
(a)
             
to acquire productive assets used or useful in carrying on the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries; or
(b)
             
to prepay Debt (including the Notes) of the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries which is not subordinated to the Notes; provided, however, that prepayment of the Notes shall be at the price and subject to the other requirements set forth in Section 8.2.
As used in this provision, a sale, lease or other disposition of assets shall be deemed to be a
"substantial part"
of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries if the book value of such assets, when added to the book value of all other assets sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries during any period of 365 consecutive days, exceeds 15% of the book value of Consolidated Total Assets, determined as of the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding such sale, lease or other disposition;
provided
that there shall be excluded from any determination of a "substantial part" any (i) sale or disposition of assets in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) Excluded Sale and Leaseback Transactions, and (iii) any transfer of assets from the Company to any Restricted Subsidiary or from any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the requirements of Section 10.2(b).
 
(a)
             
the ratio of Consolidated Debt, as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, to Adjusted EBITDA for the most recently completed period of four fiscal quarters, to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0; and
As calculated on a rolling four quarter basis on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, the Company shall not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated Income Available for Fixed Charges to (ii) Fixed Charges to be less than 2.0 to 1.0.
The Company agrees that it will not grant or provide, and at no time will it allow to exist, be created or granted, any Guaranties by Subsidiaries for the benefit of any other holders of Debt for borrowed money of the Company or its Subsidiaries, unless in the case of the giving
 
29
 
 
of any Guaranties by Subsidiaries, the holders of the Notes shall simultaneously be provided with such Guaranties.
The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business, if, as a result, the general nature of the business in which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would then be engaged in would be substantially changed from the general nature of the business in which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are engaged on the date of this Agreement.
The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary, to (a) become a Person described or designated in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or (b) engage in any dealings or transactions with any such Person.
An "Event of Default" shall exist if any of the following conditions or events shall occur and be continuing:
 
(a)
             
the Company defaults in the payment of any principal or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Note when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration or otherwise; or
(b)
             
the Company defaults in the payment of any interest on any Note for more than five Business Days after the same becomes due and payable; or
(c)
             
the Company defaults in the performance of or compliance with any term contained in Sections 10.1 through 10.10 or any other negative covenant contained in any Supplement; or
(d)
             
the Company defaults in the performance of or compliance with any term contained herein (other than those referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 11) or in any Supplement and such default is not remedied within 30 days after the earlier of (
i
) a Responsible Officer obtaining actual knowledge of such default and (
ii
) the Company receiving written notice of such default from any holder of a Note (any such written notice to be identified as a "notice of default" and to refer specifically to this paragraph (d) of Section 11); or
(e)
             
any representation or warranty made in writing by or on behalf of the Company or by any officer of the Company in this Agreement or in any Supplement or in any writing furnished in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby proves to have been false or incorrect in any material respect on the date as of which made; or
 
30
 
 
 
(f)
              
(
i
) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is in default (as principal or as guarantor or other surety) in the payment of any principal of or premium or make-whole amount or interest on any Debt that is outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of at least $5,000,000 beyond any period of grace provided with respect thereto, or (
ii
) the Company or any Subsidiary is in default in the performance of or compliance with any term of any evidence of any Debt in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least $5,000,000 or of any mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating thereto or any other condition exists, and as a consequence of such default or condition such Debt has become, or has been declared due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment, or (
iii
) as a consequence of the occurrence or continuation of any event or condition (other than the passage of time or the right of the holder of Debt to convert such Debt into equity interests), the Company or any Subsidiary has become obligated to purchase or repay Debt before its regular maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least $5,000,000; or
(g)
             
the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (
i
) is generally not paying, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due, (
ii
) files, or consents by answer or otherwise to the filing against it of, a petition for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy, for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of any jurisdiction, (
iii
) makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (
iv
) consents to the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to it or with respect to any substantial part of its property, (
v
) is adjudicated as insolvent or to be liquidated, or (
vi
) takes corporate action for the purpose of any of the foregoing; or
(h)
             
a court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction enters an order appointing, without consent by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to it or with respect to any substantial part of its property, or constituting an order for relief or approving a petition for relief or reorganization or any other petition in bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy or insolvency law of any jurisdiction, or ordering the dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any such petition shall be filed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such petition shall not be dismissed within 60 days; or
(i)
              
a final judgment or judgments for the payment of money aggregating in excess of $5,000,000 are rendered against one or more of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries and which judgments are not, within 60 days after entry thereof, bonded, discharged or stayed pending appeal, or are not discharged within 60 days after the expiration of such stay; or
(j)
              
if (
i
) any Plan shall fail to satisfy the minimum funding standards of ERISA or the Code for any plan year or part thereof or a waiver of such standards or extension of any amortization period is sought or granted under section 412 of the Code, (
ii
) a notice of intent to terminate any Plan shall have been or is reasonably expected to be filed with the PBGC or the PBGC shall have instituted proceedings under ERISA section 4042 to terminate or appoint a
 
31
 
 
trustee to administer any Plan or the PBGC shall have notified the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that a Plan may become a subject of any such proceedings, (
iii
) the aggregate "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA) under all Plans, determined in accordance with Title IV of ERISA, shall exceed $5,000,000, (
iv
) the Company or any ERISA Affiliate shall have incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans, (
v
) the Company or any ERISA Affiliate withdraws from any Multiemployer Plan, or (
vi
) the Company or any Subsidiary establishes or amends any employee welfare benefit plan that provides post-employment welfare benefits in a manner that would increase the liability of the Company or any Subsidiary thereunder; and any such event or events described in clauses (i) through (vi) above, either individually or together with any other such event or events, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As used in this paragraph (j) herein, the terms "employee benefit plan" and "employee welfare benefit plan" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3 of ERISA.
(a)
             
If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.
(b)
             
If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, holders of a majority or more in principal amount of any Series of Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes of such Series then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.
(c)
             
If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes of any Series at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.
Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (
x
) all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (
y
) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
 
32
 
 
 
 
If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.
 
At any time after any Series of Notes has been declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) of Section 12.1, the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount outstanding of such Series of Notes, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if (
a
) the Company has paid all overdue interest on such Series of Notes, all principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any such Series of Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of such Series of Notes, at the Default Rate, (
b
) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (
c
) no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to such Series of Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.
 
The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or
 
33
 
 
more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.
 
Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, of the same Series or Sub-Series and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall, in the case of a Series 2006-A Note, be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1.2, and in the case of any other Note, be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1.2 hereto or Exhibit 1 to the Supplement, as applicable. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $100,000,
provided
that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in Section 6.2.
 
Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and
 
(a)
             
in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (
provided
that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
 
 
34
 
 
 
the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.
 
Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in Chicago, Illinois at the principal office of Bank of America in such jurisdiction. The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.
 
So long as you or your nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by you under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you have made in this Section 14.2.
 
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by the holders of Notes in connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement or the Notes (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including, without limitation: (
a
) the costs and expenses incurred in
 
35
 
 
enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this Agreement or the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in connection with this Agreement or the Notes or any documents relating thereto, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, and (
b
) the costs and expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby, by the Notes or any documents relating thereto. The Company will pay, and will save you and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other than those retained by you).
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.
 
16.
            
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by any holder of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of you or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between you and the Company and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.
 
This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required Holders, except that (
a
) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Section 1.2, 2, 3, 4 (solely with respect to the Series of Notes to which Section 4 relates), 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any holder of a Note unless consented to by such holder in writing, and (
b
) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holders of each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (
i
)  change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on the Notes, (
ii
) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (
iii
) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.
 
 
36
 
 
 
(a)
             
Solicitation
. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof and of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.
(b)
             
Payment
. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.
Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "this Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.
 
Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.
 
All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing and sent (
a
) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or (
b
) by registered or certified mail
 
37
 
 
with return receipt requested (postage prepaid), or (
c
) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:
 
(i)
              
if to you or your nominee, to you or it at the address specified for such communications in Schedule A, or at such other address as you or it shall have specified to the Company in writing,
 
(ii)
            
if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company in writing, or
 
(iii)
           
if to the Company, to the Company at its address set forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer, or at such other address as the Company shall have specified to the holder of each Note in writing.
 
Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.
 
This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without limitation, (
a
) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be executed, (
b
) documents received by you at the Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (
c
) financial statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished to you, may be reproduced by you by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and you may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by you in the regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.
 
For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means information delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by you as being confidential information of the Company or such Subsidiary,
provided
that such term does not include information that (
a
) was publicly known or otherwise known to you prior to the time of such disclosure, (
b
) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by you or any Person acting on your behalf, (
c
) otherwise becomes known to you other than through disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary or (
d
) constitutes financial statements delivered to you under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. You will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures adopted by you in
 
38
 
 
good faith to protect confidential information of third parties delivered to you,
provided
that you may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (
i
) your directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment represented by your Notes), (
ii
) your financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (
iii
) any other holder of any Note, (
iv
) any Institutional Investor to which you sell or offer to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (
v
) any Person from which you offer to purchase any security of the Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (
vi
) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over you, (
vii
) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about your investment portfolio or (
viii
) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (
w
) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to you, (
x
) in response to any subpoena or other legal process, (
y
) in connection with any litigation to which you are a party or (
z
) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent you may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under your Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this Section 20.
 
You shall have the right to substitute any one of your Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both you and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of you. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to you, and you shall have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.
 
 
39
 
 
 
All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.
 
Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or Make-whole Amount or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.
 
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.
 
 
40
 
 
 
This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of Illinois excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.
 
Time is of the essence with respect to each and every covenant and agreement of the Company under this Agreement and the Notes.
