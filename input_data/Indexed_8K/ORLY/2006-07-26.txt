These results reflect the daily commitment by Team O'Reilly to provide the absolute best customer service levels in the industry."
 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "The quarter was highlighted by the opening of 49 new stores and our newest distribution center in Indianapolis. This new DC opening has been very successful and is supporting our expansion into this new market.
