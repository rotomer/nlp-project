Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President stated, "We are pleased with another successful quarter for Team O'Reilly particularly in light of the challenging macroeconomic environment in the aftermarket industry. Our team continues to focus on the basic fundamentals of providing the best customer service in our business to both our professional installer and do-it-yourself customer. We were able to maintain strong margins and post a respectable 3.6% comparable store sales growth despite the challenging conditions in the third quarter."
 
"The quarter was highlighted by continued expansion with the addition of 41 new stores primarily in regions serviced by our newest distribution centers in Indianapolis and Atlanta," stated Ted Wise, COO and Co-President. "We continue to find great markets for expansion and expect to add approximately another 44 stores in the fourth quarter."

This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company does not, and does not suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. Whenever the Company uses such non-GAAP measures, it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. The Company reports both GAAP and adjusted income and earnings per share amounts and comparisons to reflect what it believes are ongoing and/or comparable operating results excluding the one-time, non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter of 2005. The Company excludes this item in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.
