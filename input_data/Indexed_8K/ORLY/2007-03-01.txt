Springfield, MO, February 27, 2007
-- O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced record revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, representing 14 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales increases for O'Reilly since becoming a public company in April 1993.
 
Sales increased $238 million, or 11.6% from $2.05 billion in 2005 to $2.28 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, with a 3.3% increase in same-store sales. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased to $1.01 billion (or 44.1% of sales) from $893 million (or 43.6% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of 12.8%. Operating, selling, general and administrative ("OSG&A") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased to $724 million (or 31.7% of sales) from $640 million (or 31.3% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of 13.2%. The increase in the effective tax rate from 34.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 to 36.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflects a one-time benefit of $6.1 million from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, totaled $178.1 million, up 8.4% from $164.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased 6.9% to $1.55 on 115.1 million shares versus $1.45 a year ago on 113.4 million shares. 2005 results include a benefit of $0.05 per share from the favorable resolution of prior tax uncertainties in the third quarter of 2005. On an adjusted basis excluding the third quarter 2005 tax resolution benefit, diluted earnings per common share increased 10.7% from $1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $1.55 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, totaled $558 million, up 8.4% from $515 million for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, increased to $249 million (or 44.6% of sales) from $231 million (or 44.9% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 7.6%. OSG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased to $185 million (or 33.1% of sales) from $168 million (or 32.7% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 10.0%. Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, totaled $40.4 million, up 2.1% from $39.5 million for the same period in 2005. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 were even at $0.35 on 115.4 million shares versus $0.35 a year ago on 114.0 million shares.
 
Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 2.1% and 3.3% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, respectively, representing 55 quarters of comparable store sales increases since O'Reilly became a public company in April 1993.
 
"We are extremely proud of the hard work of every member of Team O'Reilly in 2006. Through a combination of relentless attention to every expense detail and our category management efforts, which generated a 44.1% gross margin, we were able to produce record operating margins in the midst of very difficult economic conditions," stated CEO and Co-President Greg Henslee. "Our team is committed to providing the highest levels of customer service in our business and we're looking forward to offering these services to customers in all the new markets in which we'll expand in 2007".
 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "We added 170 new stores in 2006 with 44 of those opening in the fourth quarter. We continue to identify excellent locations for new stores and are on pace to achieve our plan to open 190 to 195
 
 
new stores in 2007. Great customer service and executing our dual market strategy will continue to be the foundation of our growth and success as we expand into new markets."
