We are very pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter as we continue to focus on building market share in both the professional and do it yourself sides of our business, stated Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. Team OReilly continues to offer the highest levels of customer service in our industry, which resulted in another quarter of record sales and profits, and we are looking forward to offering these services to customers in markets new to our Company as we continue our aggressive expansion.
 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President stated, We opened 43 new stores during the quarter bringing our net new store total to 134 for the year. Through the first three quarters our store openings were slightly behind our plan due to permitting and construction delays. However, we are confident that by the end of the fourth quarter we will meet our target of 190 new store openings for the year. Our dedication to providing the best service to the professional installer and do-it-yourself customer continues to be the first priority in our expansion efforts.
