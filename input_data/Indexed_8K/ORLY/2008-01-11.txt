OREILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC. ANNOUNCES 2007 FOURTH QUARTER COMPARABLE STORE SALES RESULTS AND ANNOUNCES DATES FOR THE 2007 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS RELEASE AND CONFERENCE CALL
 
Springfield, MO, January 9, 2008
-- OReilly Automotive, Inc. (OReilly or the Company) (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced comparable store sales results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.
 
Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 2.1% and 3.7% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, respectively, versus a 2.1% and 3.3% respective increase in the prior year. This compares to previously issued comparable store sales guidance of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter and 4% to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President stated, Our previous guidance of 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter was based on the strong sales trends at the end of the third quarter and the solid beginning to the fourth quarter. Sales for the first half of the fourth quarter were in line with our estimates for the quarter but fell below expectations during the holiday shopping season. We believe consumers continue to be negatively impacted by economic pressures and continue to defer discretionary maintenance on their vehicles.
 
Despite the challenging macro environment, we are very proud of the efforts by Team OReilly in 2007, Ted Wise, COO and Co-President stated, We hit our target of 190 net new stores for the year with the opening of 56 new stores during the fourth quarter and we look forward to reaching our goal of 205 new stores in 2008.
