CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT
TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): April 1, 2008
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2):
 
 
 
 
On April 1, 2008, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., a Missouri corporation ("O'Reilly"), OC Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of O'Reilly ("Merger Sub") and CSK Auto Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("CSK"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement").
The Merger Agreement provides that, on and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will commence an exchange offer (the "Offer"), within ten business days of receiving the required information from CSK, to purchase all of the outstanding shares (the "Shares") of CSK common stock, $0.01 par value, for (a) a fraction of a share of O'Reilly common stock based on exchange ratio (subject to the collar as described below) equal to $11.00 divided by the average trading price of O'Reilly common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day prior to the consummation of the Offer plus (b) $1.00 in cash (subject to reduction for costs associated with obtaining credit agreement waivers or amendments, if any, incurred by CSK over $3 million); provided, however, that if the average trading price of O'Reilly common stock is greater than $29.95, then the exchange ratio shall equal 0.3673, and if the average trading price is less than $25.67, then the exchange ratio shall equal 0.4285 (the sum of (a) and (b) being the "Offer Price").
Following consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into CSK with CSK surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of O'Reilly (the "Merger"). In the Merger, each outstanding Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than the Shares held in the treasury of CSK, owned by O'Reilly, Merger Sub, or any subsidiary of O'Reilly or CSK immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, and other than the Shares as to which appraisal rights have been perfected in accordance with applicable law) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. At the effective time of the Merger, (i) each outstanding option to acquire CSK common stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of O'Reilly common stock equal to the number of shares subject to such stock option multiplied by an exchange ratio based upon the Offer Price and (ii) each other unvested equity-based award will be converted into an equity-based award relating to a number of shares of O'Reilly common stock equal to the number of shares subject to such equity-based award multiplied by an exchange ratio based upon the Offer Price.
Consummation of the Offer is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to (i) at least a majority of shares of CSK common stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis being tendered into the Offer, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, (iii) the registration statement for O'Reilly's common stock issuable in connection with the Offer and Merger being declared effective and the listing of such shares on Nasdaq, (iv) receipt of opinions of counsel regarding tax-free reorganization and (v) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to CSK's business. The Offer is not subject to a financing condition.
The Offer will expire at midnight, New York time, on the 20th business day following and including the commencement date, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Offer and the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
The consummation of the Merger is subject to various additional conditions, including, if required under Delaware law, approval of the Merger Agreement by CSK stockholders. The parties have agreed that if after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and any subsequent offering period, and after giving effect to any shares of CSK common stock purchased pursuant to the option described in the next paragraph, Merger Sub owns at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, then once the other conditions of the Merger are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge into CSK in a "short-form" merger pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware law which will not require a vote of CSK's stockholders.
In the Merger Agreement, CSK has granted to O'Reilly and Merger Sub an option (the "Top Up Option") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number of newly issued shares of CSK common stock equal to the lowest number of shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by O'Reilly or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top Up Option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the fully diluted shares of CSK common stock (after giving effect to the issuance of all shares subject to the Top Up Option). O'Reilly or Merger Sub may exercise the Top Up Option, in whole or in part, provided that upon exercise of the Top Up Option, O'Reilly will directly or indirectly own one share more than 90% of the outstanding Shares (after giving effect to the issuance of shares of CSK common stock pursuant to the exercise of the Top Up Option), at any time on or after the consummation of the Offer and prior to (i) the effective time of the Merger and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, effective upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, O'Reilly will be entitled to designate a number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on CSK's Board of Directors and Board committees equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on CSK's Board of Directors or Board committee, as applicable, and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by O'Reilly and/or Merger Sub bears to the number of Shares then outstanding.
 
 
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by O'Reilly, Merger Sub and CSK. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including with respect to the operations of the business of CSK and its subsidiaries between signing and closing, restrictions on the solicitation of proposals by CSK with respect to alternative transactions, governmental filings and approvals and other matters. The Offer and the Merger are intended to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for O'Reilly and CSK, including if the Offer is not consummated on or before the date that is 180 days after the date of the Merger Agreement, and further provides that if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, CSK will be required to pay O'Reilly a termination fee of $22 million. In the event that the average trading price of O'Reilly's common stock during the five consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day prior to the closing of the Offer is less than or equal to $21.00 per share, CSK may terminate the Merger Agreement unless O'Reilly exercises its option to issue an additional number of its shares or increase the amount of cash to be paid such that the total value of O'Reilly common stock and cash exchanged for each share of the Company's common stock is at least equal to $10.00 (subject to reduction for costs associated with obtaining credit agreement waivers or amendments, if any, incurred by CSK over $3 million).
The Board of Directors of each of O'Reilly, Merger Sub and CSK has approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about O'Reilly, Merger Sub or CSK.
Additional Information
 
In connection with the Offer, O'Reilly intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 and a Schedule TO with the SEC and CSK intends to file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9. Such documents, however, are not currently available. These documents contain important information about the transaction and should be read before any decision is made with respect to the Offer.

Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
 
Statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K may contain certain forward-looking statements relating to O'Reilly and its expectations for the proposed acquisition of CSK that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All such statements concerning activities, events or developments that O'Reilly expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:
AGREEMENT
 
 
 
 
ARTICLE I
 
THE OFFER
(a)
           
Provided that nothing shall have occurred that, had the Offer been commenced, would give rise to a right to terminate the Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set forth in Annex I, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Company satisfies its obligations in the third sentence of Section 1.2(a)), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
Exchange Act
)) the Offer. The Offer and the obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents at least a majority of the sum of (i) the total number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 1.1(b)) and (ii) a number of Shares determined by Parent up to a maximum of the total number of Shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all options, warrants, rights and convertible securities (if any) that will be vested by the Outside Date (such sum being the 
Fully-Diluted Shares
) (the 
Minimum Condition
) and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I (together with the Minimum Condition, the 
Offer Conditions
). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided, that without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than adding consideration), (iii) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (iv) waive or change the Minimum Condition or the Termination Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions, (vi) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(b) or (vii) modify any Offer Condition or any term of the Offer set forth in this Agreement in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares.
(b)
          
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer shall initially expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is commenced. Merger Sub shall extend the Offer (1) on one or more occasions for periods determined by Merger Sub of up to 20 Business Days per extension if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived, from time to time, until the earliest to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions and the consummation of the Offer or (y) the termination of this Agreement as permitted by Article VIII; and (2) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
SEC
) or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable Law; provided, that no such extension or extensions shall occur after the earlier to occur of (1) the date on which all of the
 
2
 
 
conditions of the Offer have been satisfied or waived and (2) the Outside Date; provided, further, notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, shall extend the Offer if in its reasonable discretion such extension is necessary for Parent to complete the necessary conditions to complete its financing transactions in connection with the Offer for an aggregate period of not more than ten (10) Business Days beyond the last expiration date of the Offer that would otherwise be permitted hereunder (
Financing Extension
) provided, further, notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may not extend the Offer pursuant to a Financing Extension if such extension would extend the expiration date of the Offer to a date later than the 30th Business Day after the date that the Offer is commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer, if required, in accordance with Section 6.23(c). Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, provide one or more subsequent offering periods (each, a 
Subsequent Offering Period
) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, if, as of the commencement of each such Subsequent Offering Period, there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and any prior Subsequent Offering Period that number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the 
DGCL
).
(c)
           
Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions as of any scheduled or extended expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly accept for exchange and exchange all Shares (A) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, and (B) validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period.
(d)
          
In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII prior to acceptance of Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares previously tendered.
(e)
           
No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by Section 3.4, which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Trading Price.
(a)
           
As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file a Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including exhibits thereto, the 
Schedule TO
) with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the 
Offer to Purchase
) and forms of the related letter transmittal and form of summary advertisement, (ii) file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (or similar successor form) to register the offer and sale of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer

Prospectus
) containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and such other documents, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the 
Offer Documents
) and (iii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.

Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct, as promptly as practicable, any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments and supplements thereto, in each case, prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to all additions, deletions, changes and other comments suggested by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (A) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, as promptly as practicable, after receipt of those comments or other communications, and (B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.
(a)
           
The Company hereby consents to the Offer and, to the extent that no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with Section 6.4, to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company (the 
Company Board
) described in Section 4.3 (the 
Board Recommendation
).
(b)
          
As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D 9 (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including exhibits thereto, the 
Schedule 14D 9
) that, subject to Section 6.4, shall contain the Board Recommendation. Upon request by the Company, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable, furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent
 
4
 
 
and Merger Sub that may be required by applicable federal securities Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D 9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to correct, as promptly as practicable, any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D 9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D 9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D 9 and any amendments and supplements thereto, in each case, prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to all additions, deletions, changes or other comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall promptly provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D 9 as promptly as practicable after receipt of those comments or other communications, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.
(c)
           
In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent promptly to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels, security position listings, any non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as of the most recent practicable date and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available stockholder information (including, but not limited to, periodic updates of such information) as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except to facilitate dissemination of the Offer Documents and to otherwise perform any obligations hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall treat the information contained in such labels, listing or files and any additional information referred to in the preceding sentence in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 18, 2007, between Parent and the Company (the 
Confidentiality Agreement
).
(a)
           
Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly upon the payment by Merger Sub for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board (determined after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this Section 1.4(a)) and (y) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or its Affiliates (including Merger Sub) at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including, without limitation, increasing the size of the Company Board and/or seeking and accepting the resignations of one or more incumbent
 
5
 
 
directors. At such time, the Company shall, also promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, other than a committee of the Company Board, if any, established to take action with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof). The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that two of the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof, each of whom shall be an independent director as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, shall remain members of the Company Board until the Effective Time (the 
Company Directors
). If the Company Directors are unable to serve for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Company Director or his or her designee shall be entitled to designate a person (or persons) to fill such vacancy (or vacancies) and such person shall be a Company Director for all purposes hereunder. If at any time the Company Directors deem it necessary to consult legal counsel in connection with their duties as Company Directors or actions taken, being taken or to be taken by the Company, the Company Directors may retain one firm as legal counsel for such purpose in each such instance, and the Company shall pay, at the Company Directors discretion, the reasonable, documented fees and expenses of any such firm acting as legal counsel incurred in connection herewith.
(b)
          
The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. Subject to Parents compliance with the final sentence of this Section 1.4(b), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.4, including mailing to stockholders together with the Schedule 14D 9 the information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Parent shall supply to the Company any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
(c)
           
Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to this Section 1.4 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment of this Agreement, any termination of the Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder or other action adversely affecting the rights of stockholders of the Company (other than Parent or Merger Sub), with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will require the concurrence of a majority of the Company Directors; provided, that if there shall be no Company Directors as a result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected by a majority vote of the Company Board.
(a)
           
The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Parent and Merger Sub an option (the 
Top-Up Option
), exercisable upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.5, to purchase that number of Shares (the 
Top-Up Option Shares
) equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares directly or indirectly owned
 
6
 
 
by Parent at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding (taking into account the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; provided, that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares (i) that would require the Company to obtain stockholder approval under applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the 
NYSE
), or (ii) in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of common stock (giving effect to Shares reserved for issuance under the Company Equity Plans and pursuant to the exercise of any other securities convertible into or exchangeable into Shares, if any, as if such Shares were outstanding but not giving effect to Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Rights, but including as authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.5, any shares held in the treasury of the Company). Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercised in the event that it would prevent the Offer, the Merger and the LLC Merger (if any) from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
(b)
          
Parent or Merger Sub may exercise the Top Up Option, in whole or in part, at any time after the consummation of the Offer and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, that upon exercise of the Top Up Option, Parent will directly or indirectly own one share more than 90% of the Company Shares (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares).
(c)
           
In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) the number of Top Up Shares that Parent or Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top Up Option, and (iii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, which shall not be more than five (5) Business Days after delivery of such notice (the

(a)
           
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively, the 
Shares
) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.l(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares), together with the associated Rights, shall thereupon be cancelled and extinguished and converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive (x) a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (
Parent Common Stock
) equal to the Exchange Ratio (the 
Per Share Stock Consideration
) and (y) $1.00 in cash minus the Adjustment Amount, if any (the 
Per Share Cash Consideration
, and together with the Per Share Stock Consideration, the 
Offer Price
)
 
9
 
 
(together with any cash paid in respect of fractional shares in accordance with Section 3.3(g), without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax ) (the 
Merger Consideration
). For purposes of this Agreement, 
Exchange Ratio
 shall equal $11.00 divided by the Parent Trading Price and rounded to four decimal places; provided, however, that if the Parent Trading Price is greater than $29.95, then the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.3673, and if the Parent Trading Price is less than $25.67, then the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.4285. For purposes of this Agreement, the 
Parent Trading Price
 means the average of the reported closing sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. (
NASDAQ
) as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the second trading day prior to the consummation of the Offer. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Adjustment Amount
 shall mean an amount equal to quotient obtained by dividing (1) (x) minus (y) by (2) (z) where (x) equals the sum of any amount paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries to the lenders under the Credit Agreements in connection with obtaining any bank consent, waiver or amendment under the Credit Agreements after the date hereof, (y) equals $3,000,000 and (z) equals the Fully-Diluted Shares; provided, that in the event the quotient is a negative number, the Adjustment Amount shall be zero; provided, further, that the Adjustment Amount shall in no event exceed $1.00; provided, further, that for all purposes hereof, the Adjustment Amount shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10 (one-tenth) of a cent.
(b)
          
Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
(c)
           
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
(d)
          
If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, all mechanics of calculating the Exchange Ratio as set forth in Section 3.1(a) shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change.
(a)
           
At the Effective Time (or such earlier date as Parent may elect on or following consummation of the Offer), each option or similar right (each, a 
Company Stock Option
) to purchase Shares granted under any employee or director stock option, stock purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company (the 
Company Equity Plans
), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
 
10
 
 
to the Effective Time (each, an 
Assumed Option
) shall be automatically converted into an option to acquire that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option and (y) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. Each Assumed Option shall have an exercise price equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the per share exercise price of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (which price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest cent). After the Effective Time, each Assumed Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration or vesting thereof, provided for in the relevant Company Equity Plan, or in the related award document by reason of the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby). It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option that qualifies as an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time and that the foregoing conversion formula shall be adjusted if necessary to comply with Section 409A and 424(a) of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Option Exchange Ratio
 shall be the sum of (x) plus (y), where (x) is the Exchange Ratio and (y) is the number equal to the quotient of the Per Share Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Trading Price.
(b)
          
At the Effective Time, each vested right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of a number of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares and other stock-based awards, other than Company Stock Options (each, a 
Company Stock-Based Award
), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock-Based Award in accordance with Section 3.1(a). At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock-Based Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a comparable right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Option Exchange Ratio, as calculated in accordance with Section 3.2(a), multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock-Based Award. After the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock-Based Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration or vesting thereof, provided for in the relevant Company Equity Plan, or in the related award document by reason of the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby).
(c)
           
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall adopt such resolutions and take such appropriate action as may be reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2, including adopting resolutions of its Compensation Committee and delivering to the other party such documentation of such actions as the other party may reasonably request.
 
 
11
 
 
(a)
           
Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent or other exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the 
Exchange Agent
) to receive the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article III. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Exchange Agent certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article III (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the 
Exchange Fund
). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article III, except as provided in this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this Article III. Parent shall have the right to withdraw from the Exchange Fund any amount paid or shares of Parent Common Stock delivered by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any Dissenting Shares, the amount so withdrawn not to exceed the amount of consideration held in the Exchange Fund with respect to such Dissenting Shares.
(b)
          
As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a certificate or certificates (
Certificates
) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares or (ii) uncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (
Book-Entry Shares
) which, in each case, were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, together with such letter(s) of transmittal properly completed and duly executed to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h). Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h), and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event that the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h) are to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder
 
12
 
 
of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h) payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, without any interest thereon.
(c)
           
The delivery of all shares of Parent Common Stock and all cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares, together with the associated Rights, formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.
(d)
          
The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.
(e)
           
At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h), without any interest thereon, payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares, for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.
(f)
           
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
 
13
 
 
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.3(h), without any interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
(g)
          
No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated by Section 3.4, which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Trading Price.
(h)
          
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.3(g) will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without any interest thereon (i) promptly after such surrender, the Merger Consideration and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.
Section 3.4
       
Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
Code
), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Section 3.5
       
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (
Dissenting Shares
) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
 
14
 
 
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4(a), at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.4(a) and that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and the Standstill Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement), a copy of which shall promptly be provided to Parent; provided, however, that any material non-public information provided to such Person has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent contemporaneously as it is provided to such Person and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal.
(c)
           
Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (an 
Adverse Recommendation Change
), (ii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve or publicly propose to take any such actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, if, prior to consummation of the Offer, (A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Boards exercise of its fiduciary duties, the Company Board or any committee thereof may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, subject to compliance with Section 6.4(d).
(d)
          
At any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if (i) the Company has provided Parent written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), identifying the Superior Proposal then determined to be more favorable and including a copy of the definitive acquisition agreement for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into, (ii) within a period of five (5) Business Days following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (i) above, Parent does not propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial advisors) to be as favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal (the Company having caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent in good faith during such five (5) Business Day period any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent), and (iii) at least five (5) Business Days after the Company has provided the notice referred to in clause (i) above, the Company simultaneously delivers to Parent (A) an
 
48
 
 
irrevocable written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) and (B) a wire transfer of same day funds in the amount of the Termination Fee.
(e)
           
The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer.
(f)
           
Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from (ii) making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law.
(i)
     
Acquisition Proposal
 means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for (A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, joint venture recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving an acquisition of the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 10% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Offer or the Merger.
(ii)
   
Superior Proposal
 means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which proposal was not the result of a breach of this Section 6.4, that (a) is not conditioned upon obtaining financing or any regulatory approvals or consents beyond or in addition to those regulatory approvals and consents required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) is reasonably likely to be consummated (taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person submitting such an Acquisition Proposal) and (c) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and the Companys financial advisors) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys
 
49
 
 
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement in response to the Superior Proposal); provided, that for the purposes of this definition of 
Superior Proposal
, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.4(g)(i), except that the reference to 10% shall be deemed to be a reference to 80%.
Section 6.5
       
Prospectus/Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Stockholders Meeting.
 
(a)
           
In the event that Section 253 of the DGCL is unavailable and inapplicable to effectuate the Merger, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall, with the assistance and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, prepare the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall, with the assistance and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Company, prepare a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement (the 
Post-Effective Amendment
) for the offer and sale of the Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Post-Effective Amendment is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Post-Effective Amendment will be made by Parent, or with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Post-Effective Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Post-Effective Amendment or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers
 
50
 
 
such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Each of the parties hereto shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance to such party in all material respects with the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act, and (iii) the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.
(b)
          
In the event that Section 253 of the DGCL is unavailable and inapplicable to effectuate the Merger, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the 
Company Stockholders Meeting
) and (ii) except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.4, include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger.
(a)
           
From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best effects to cause its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and representative to, afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its officers, employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law.
(b)
          
Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
(c)
           
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall afford to the Company and its Representatives reasonable access to Parents personnel and records (i) on a basis consistent with Parents access to such personnel and records prior to the date hereof in connection with Parents due diligence review of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary
 
51
 
 
for the Company to determine whether the conditions set forth in Section 6.23, Section 7.1 or Annex I have been satisfied.
(a)
           
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 6.7(c), each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no party hereto shall take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make appropriate filings under any Antitrust Law, including an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent.
(b)
          
Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Sections 6.7(a) and (c) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the 
FTC
), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the 
DOJ
) or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.
(c)
           
In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.7(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
 
52
 
 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub shall be strictly obligated to resolve any such objections or suits necessary to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or business of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to resolve such objections or suits; provided, however, that Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be obligated to, become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, hold separate, dispose of any assets or conduct or change its business unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be, only in the event the Closing occurs.
(d)
          
Subject to the obligations under Section 6.7(c), in the event that any administrative or judicial Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other; (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall be obligated to contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at their cost and expense, any Action or Actions, whether judicial or administrative, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(e)
           
For purposes of this Agreement, 
Antitrust Law
 means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.
(a)
           
Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.1 hereof, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Arrangements to Covered Securityholders, all such amounts payable under such Arrangements shall (a) be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (b) shall not be calculated based on the number of Shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover,
 
53
 
 
the Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) shall take such steps as may be required so that, prior to the conclusion of the Offer: (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Arrangement shall be approved as an employment, compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (ii) the safe harbor provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the consummation of the Offer all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board or its independent directors. Furthermore, to the extent the Company has failed to comply with the terms of this Section 6.8(a), the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to cure such noncompliance as promptly as practicable.
(b)
          
As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its Subsidiaries and the Surviving Corporation to, give those employees of Parent and employees of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time who shall have been employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (
Company Employees
) full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans other than any such plans maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), under any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation, paid time off, severance, and retiree medical) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a 
Parent Plan
) to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such recognition would result in duplication of benefits. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a 
welfare benefit plan
 (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i) provide for immediate eligibility and coverage, (ii) cause there to be waived any waiting periods, pre-existing condition, evidence of insurability, good health, actively at work, or other eligibility limitations in each case to the extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable under the corresponding Company Plan and (iii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees during the plan year in progress as of the Effective Time under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
(c)
           
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety (90) days thereafter, not to effectuate a plant closing or mass layoff as those terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (together with any similar state or local Law, 
WARN
) affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or Company Employee, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries not to take any such action after such ninety (90) day period without complying with all provisions of WARN, or any similar provision of applicable foreign Law.
(d)
          
Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.8(d), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor, and be responsible for any accrued or unused vacation, sick and personal leave, (collectively, 
Paid Time Off
) to which any
 
54
 
 
Company Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time-off policy applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (the 
PTO Policy
). In addition to the assumption of past Paid Time Off accruals as described above, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall continue to provide Paid Time Off benefits (including new paid time off accruals) to Company Employees for service with Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time through December 31, 2008, which Paid Time Off Benefits shall be at least equal to the Paid Time Off benefits provided to Company Employees under the PTO Policy prior to the Effective Time (counting both pre- and post-Effective Time service for purposes of entitlement to such Paid Time Off benefits). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to allow such Company Employee to use such accrued and unused Paid Time Off in accordance with the terms of the PTO Policy prior to December 31, 2009. To the extent any of the Paid Time Off described in the first two sentences of this Section 6.8(d) is not used on or prior to December 31, 2009, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay in cash to each Company Employee an amount equal to any such unused Paid Time Off in excess of the amount of Paid Time Off allowed to be accrued under Parents applicable policies (the 
PTO Limit
), but only to the extent that such unused Paid Time Off as of December 31, 2009 is attributable to vacation or, with respect to employees in California or states that require such pay by Law, personal days, it being understood that there shall be no payout of such Paid Time Off with respect to sick days. Company Employees will no longer be entitled to any Paid Time Off in excess of the PTO Limit following December 31, 2009. With respect to Company Employees who experience a termination of employment, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the provisions of the PTO Policy with respect to payments in respect of Paid Time Off on termination of employment (including any limitations on the obligation to make such payments in the event of a for cause or similar termination, consistent with applicable Law); provided, however, that with respect to Paid Time Off Benefits accrued following December 31, 2008, any limitations with respect to payments in respect of Paid Time Off on termination of employment shall be determined (consistent with applicable Law) shall be determined based on the Paid Time Off policy determined by Parent. Following December 31, 2009, Parent and its Subsidiaries may implement any Paid Time Off or similar policy as Parent may determine in its discretion.
Section 6.9
       
Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards of Directors shall use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Section 6.10
     
Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify each other in writing of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries that
 
55
 
 
relates to the Offer, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in (i) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII or (ii) the conditions to the Offer set forth in Section 6.23 or Annex I not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; provided further, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to clause (c) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in Article VII or the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I and Section 6.23 (so long as such failure was not the result of an intentional or willful breach of this Section 6.10) except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.
(a)
           
Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the 
Indemnified Parties
), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, 
Costs
), incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any such Action, each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by DGCL or the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification; provided further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to indemnify or advance expenses to any Indemnified Party in connection with an Action (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnified Party unless such Action (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.
(b)
          
Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its
 
56
 
 
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time.
(c)
           
For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a tail policy, in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; provided further, that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a tail policy and the coverage thereunder costs more than 250% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium. In lieu of the foregoing sentence, at the Companys option, after consultation with Parent, the Company may purchase, in accordance with the cost constraints set forth above, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid tail policy on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.
(d)
          
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.11 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Action.
(e)
           
The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.
(f)
           
In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
 
57
 
 
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.
Section 6.12
     
Financing . At the sole cost and expense of Parent, the Company shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist Parent with respect to the arrangement of Parents financing (the

Parent Tax Opinion
) (which opinion may rely on such assumptions and representations as such counsel reasonably deems appropriate), such Parent Tax Opinion shall have been withdrawn or an event shall have occurred that prevents Parent from relying on such Parent Tax Opinion, provided that such condition may be waived by Parent in its sole discretion, or (G) immediately prior to the acceptance of Shares for payment in the Offer, any of the following conditions exists:
(a)
           
(i) any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and such order, decree, injunction, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable or (ii) there shall be any pending action, proceeding or counterclaim by any Governmental Entity with respect to the actions set forth in subclause (i); provided, however, that the condition set forth in this clause (a)(ii) shall only be a condition during the first 60 days after the date of this Agreement;
(b)
          
any Law enacted, entered, enforced, issued or in effect that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Agreement;
(c)
           
(i) other than the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement (disregarding any limitation as to materiality, 
Material Adverse Effect
 or similar qualifiers set forth therein), shall not be true and correct in all respects, as of the date of the Agreement or at the consummation of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (except for any representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which need only to be true as of such specified date), except where the failure to be so true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and such breach shall not have been cured; or (ii) any of the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 shall not be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Agreement and at the consummation of the Offer as if made at and as of such time and such breach shall not have been cured;
(d)
          
the Company shall have materially breached any of its obligations under the Agreement and such breach or failure to perform shall not have been cured;
(e)
           
any event, change or development shall have occurred following the date of the Agreement that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and such Material Adverse Effect shall not have been cured;
 
 
 
(f)
           
(i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred and not been withdrawn, or (ii) the Company shall have approved, endorsed or recommended to the Companys stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Offer or the Merger; or
(g)
          
the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms (the 
Termination Condition
).
Approximately 24 hours prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company certifying that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) in this Annex I are satisfied as of such time and date.
The foregoing conditions (except for the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition) are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition, in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time in their sole discretion prior to the expiration of the Offer, except that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition) may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in their sole discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Annex I, neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth herein to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the breach of the Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or the failure by Parent or Merger to fulfill any of their respective obligations thereunder.
The capitalized terms used in this Annex I and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 
Agreement
), dated as of April 1, 2008, between OReilly Automotive, Inc., a Missouri corporation, OC Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, and CSK Auto Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
