Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
On July 11, 2008, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with, among others, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent ("Bank of America"), providing for a 5-year $1.2 billion asset-based senior secured facility. The Credit Agreement is comprised of (i) a $1.075 billion tranche A revolving credit facility (the "tranche A revolver") and (ii) a $125.0 million first-in-last-out revolving credit facility (the "FILO tranche"). Availability under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base determined by advances against the eligible accounts receivable, inventory and real estate of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement.
O'Reilly is using the proceeds from the Credit Agreement for (i) payment of the cash portion of the offer consideration to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSK common stock, (ii) refinancing certain outstanding O'Reilly and CSK indebtedness, (iii) payment of customary fees and expenses associated with the offer, the financing and the merger and (iv) funding working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes of the combined corporation.
Borrowings under the tranche A revolver initially bear interest, at O'Reilly's option, at a rate equal to either (i) a base rate plus 1.50% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.5% per annum, each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. Borrowings under the FILO tranche are expected to bear interest, at O'Reilly's option, at a rate equal to either (i) a base rate plus 2.75% per annum or (ii) LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds. The base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by Bank of America from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 0.50%. In addition, O'Reilly paid or will pay customary commitment fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility.
O'Reilly and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries which own any assets of the type included in the borrowing base are borrowers. Each of the wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of O'Reilly that are not borrowers are guarantors. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on (i) substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of O'Reilly and each of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the credit parties, (ii) all of the capital stock of each direct domestic subsidiary of each credit party and (iii) 65% of the voting stock and 100% of the non-voting stock of each direct foreign subsidiary of each credit party.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, investments and dividends and other distributions. The credit facility also includes customary events of defaults.
The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the complete terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Administrative Agent will distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of LIBO Rate Loans (or in the case of any Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or in the case of a

Section 2.02
 
Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Committed Loans that are Prime Rate Loans. If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Lead Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent

(iii) the Redemption Date (which shall be a Business Day);
(iv) the Redemption Price at which Notes are to be redeemed;
(v) the place or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Notes;

If any Note selected for partial redemption is submitted for exchange in part after such selection, the portion of such Note submitted for exchange shall be deemed (so far as may be possible) to be from the portion selected for redemption. The Notes (or portions thereof) so selected shall be deemed duly selected for redemption for all purposes hereof, notwithstanding that any such Note is submitted for exchange in part before the mailing of the Redemption Notice.

On presentation and surrender of such Notes at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Notes or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the Redemption Price plus interest accrued to, but not including, the Redemption Date; provided that if the applicable Redemption Date is after the applicable Regular Record Date and on or before an Interest Payment Date, the Interest payable on such Interest Payment Date shall be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the holders of record of such Notes on the applicable Regular Record Date instead of the holders surrendering such Notes for redemption on such date.
Payment of Notes Called for Redemption by the Company

provided
(ii) the Issuer consolidates with or merges with or into another Person, is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into (A) cash or property other than securities, or (B) cash, securities or other property, that in the case of clause (B), such transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, then the Notes may be surrendered for exchange at any time beginning 25 calendar days
provided
prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until and including the date which is 25 calendar days after the actual effective date of the transaction (or if such consolidation, merger, share exchange or transfer also constitutes a Fundamental Change, until the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Fundamental Change). The Company's Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated Effective Date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company by publication on its Web site or through such other public medium as it may use at that time not later than two Business Days prior to such 25th calendar day;
(iii) a Fundamental Change of the type described in clause (i) of the definition of Fundamental Change occurs, holders may surrender Notes for exchange at any time beginning on the actual Effective Date of such Fundamental Change until and including the date which is 30 calendar days after the Effective Date of such transaction or if, later, until the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date corresponding to such Fundamental Change.
(c) Whenever the Notes shall become exchangeable pursuant to this Section 14.01, the Company or, at the Company's request, and after the Company has prepared and delivered such notice to the Trustee, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the holders of the event triggering such exchangeability in the manner provided in Section 16.03, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information by publication on the Company's Web site or through such other public medium as it may use at such time. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice.
The Company or its designated agent shall determine on a daily basis during the last 20 Trading Days of each fiscal quarter (until such day, if any, as the Notes are determined to be exchangeable) whether the Notes shall be exchangeable as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in Section 14.01(a)(i) and, if the Notes shall be so exchangeable, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Exchange Agent written notice thereof.
(d) A Note in respect of which a holder is electing to exercise its option to require repurchase upon a Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 3.04 or repurchase pursuant to Section 3.05 may be exchanged only if such holder withdraws its election in accordance with Section 3.06(d). A holder of Notes is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such holder has exchanged his Notes into Common Stock, and only to the extent such Notes are deemed to have been exchanged to Common Stock under this Article 14.
(e) If a Noteholder elects to exchange its notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction pursuant to Section 14.01(b) that occurs prior to December 15, 2010, and the corporate transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change as described in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof, subject to Section 14.07, the Exchange Rate shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below, that if the Stock Price is greater than $60.00 or less than $14.59 (subject in each case to adjustment as described below), the number of Additional Shares shall be zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Exchange Rate be increased pursuant to this Section 14.01(e) to a rate that would exceed 68.4501 shares, subject to adjustments in the same manner as the Exchange Rate as set forth in Section 14.05 per $1,000 Principal Amount of Notes.
Additional Shares
provided
The number of Additional Shares will be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the actual effective date of such corporate transaction (the "") and the Stock Price with respect to such corporate transaction; that if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year.
Effective Date
provided
The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto and set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 14.01(e) will be adjusted as of any date on which the Exchange Rate of the Notes is adjusted pursuant to Section 14.05. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Exchange Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Exchange Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares will be adjusted in the same manner as the Exchange Rate as set forth in Section 14.05.
Any exchange of Notes occurring at a time when the Notes would be exchangeable in light of the expected or actual occurrence of a Fundamental Change will be deemed to have occurred in connection with such Fundamental Change notwithstanding the fact that a Note may then be exchangeable because another condition to exchange has been satisfied.
Section 14.02. . In order to exercise the exchange right with respect to any Note in certificated form, the Company must receive at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose or, at the option of such holder, the Corporate Trust Office, such Note with the original or facsimile of the form entitled "" on the reverse thereof, which is irrevocable, duly completed and manually signed, together with such Notes duly endorsed for transfer. Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such exchange shall be issued, and to whom the cash payable on such exchange shall be delivered, and shall be accompanied by transfer or similar taxes, if required pursuant to Section 14.08, and funds equal to the Interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder of the Note is not entitled, if required pursuant to this Section 14.02.

Form of Exchange Notice
In order to exercise the exchange right with respect to any interest in a Global Note, the beneficial holder must complete, or cause to be completed, the appropriate instruction form for exchange pursuant to the Depositary's book-entry exchange program, deliver, or cause to be delivered, by book-entry delivery an interest in such Global Note, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Trustee or Exchange Agent, and pay the funds, if any, required by this Section 14.02 and any transfer taxes if required pursuant to Section 14.08.
The Company will deliver the Settlement Amount to exchanging holders on the second Business Day immediately following the last day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, or in the case of an optional redemption pursuant to Section 3.02, the Redemption Date. Subject to compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable on exchange are to be issued in a name other than that of the Noteholder (as if such transfer were a transfer of the Note or Notes (or portion thereof) so exchanged), the Company shall issue and shall deliver through the Exchange Agent to such Noteholder at the office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, a check or cash in respect of the lesser of the aggregate Principal Amount of Notes being exchanged and the Exchange Value in respect of such Notes, calculated by the Company as provided in Section 14.03 and a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, issuable upon the exchange of such Note or Notes (or portion thereof) so exchanged as determined by the Company as provided in Section 14.03, or if the Common Stock is eligible for transfer through The Depository Trust Company, the Company shall make a book-entry transfer of such number of shares of Common Stock through The Depository Trust Company, and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of any share of Common Stock arising upon such exchange. In case any Note of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial exchange, and subject to Section 2.03, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to him, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the unexchanged portion of the surrendered Note.
Each exchange shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Note (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth above in this Section 14.02 have been satisfied as to such Note (or portion thereof) (such date, the ""), and the Person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such exchange shall be deemed to have become on said date the holder of record of the shares represented thereby; that any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall constitute the Person in whose name the certificates are to be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such exchange shall be at the Exchange Rate in effect on the date upon which such Note shall be surrendered.
Exchange Date
provided
Any Note or portion thereof surrendered for exchange during the period from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Regular Record Date to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the corresponding Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the Interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Principal Amount being exchanged; that no such payment need be made (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the third Trading Day after the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Trading Day after the
provided
corresponding Interest Payment Date or (3) to the extent of any overdue Interest, if any overdue Interest exists at the time of exchange with respect to such Note. Except as provided above in this Section 14.02, no payment or other adjustment shall be made for Interest accrued on any Note exchanged or for dividends on any shares issued upon the exchange of such Note as provided in this Article 14.
Upon the exchange of an interest in a Global Note, the Exchange Agent, or the Custodian at the direction of the Exchange Agent, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the Principal Amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any exchanges of Notes effected through any Exchange Agent other than the Trustee.
Upon the exchange of a Note, that portion of the accrued but unpaid Interest with respect to the exchanged Note shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the holder thereof through delivery of cash or a combination of cash and the Common Stock, as the case may be (together with the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, if any) in exchange for the Note being exchanged pursuant to the provisions hereof; and cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as the case may be (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for and in satisfaction of the Company's obligation to pay the Principal Amount of the exchanged Note and the accrued but unpaid Interest, and the balance, if any, of such fair market value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as issued in exchange for and in satisfaction of the right to exchange the Note being exchanged pursuant to the provisions hereof.
Section 14.03. . (a) Upon receipt of a notice of exchange, the Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1,000 Principal Amount of Notes being exchanged a settlement amount (the "") consisting of (i) cash equal to the lesser of $1,000 and the Exchange Value and (ii) to the extent the Exchange Value exceeds $1,000, a number of shares equal to the sum of, for each day of the 20 Trading Day Cash Settlement Averaging Period, (A) 5% of the difference between the Exchange Value and $1,000, divided by (B) the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for such day.

(b) If more than one Note shall be surrendered for exchange at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issuable upon exchange, if any, shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes so surrendered. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon exchange of Notes. If any fractional share of Common Stock would be issuable upon the exchange of any Note or Notes, the Company shall make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash to the holder of Notes at a price equal to the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock over the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
Section 14.04. . Each $1,000 Principal Amount of the Notes shall be exchangeable into the number of shares of Common Stock specified in the form of Note (herein called the "") attached as Exhibit A hereto (initially 49.8473 shares), subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 14.
Exchange Rate
Exchange Rate
Section 14.05. . The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Exchange Rate
(a) If the Issuer issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of the Common Stock, or effects a share split or share combination, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 15.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Exchange Rate shall again be adjusted to the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(b) If the Issuer issues to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling such holders for a period of not more than 45 calendar days to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event
X = the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights divided by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Record Date for the issuance of such rights or warrants.
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered prior to the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Exchange Rate shall be readjusted to the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Exchange Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed.
In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Issuer for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
(c) If the Issuer distributes shares of its capital stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property of the Issuer to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding:
(i) dividends or distributions and rights or warrants referred to in clause (a) or (b) above; and
(ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash;
then the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
ER
0
= the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
ER' = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
SP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the ex-date for such distribution
FMV = the fair market value (as determined by the Company's Board of Directors) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Stock Record Date for such distribution.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit (a "") the Exchange Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Stock Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where,
ER
0
= the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to such distribution
ER' = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately after such distribution
FMV
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first ten consecutive Trading Day period after the effective date of the Spin-Off
MP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the first ten consecutive Trading Day period after the effective date of the Spin-Off.
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.
(d) If the Issuer makes any cash dividend or distribution during any of the Issuer's quarterly fiscal period to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
ER
0
= the Exchange Rate in effect immediately prior to the Stock Record Date for such dividend or distribution
ER' = the Exchange Rate in effect immediately after the Stock Record Date for such dividend or distribution
SP
0
= the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the ex-date for such dividend or distribution
C = the amount in cash per share the Issuer dividends or distributes to holders of Common Stock.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date for such determination.
(e) If the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries purchases shares of Common Stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer which involves an aggregate per share consideration that exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (such last date, the ""), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Expiration Time
 
where,
ER
0
= the Exchange Rate in effect on the date such tender or exchange offer expires
ER' = the Exchange Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Company's Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires
SP' = the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
If the Issuer is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Issuer is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Exchange Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Exchange Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
If, however, the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Exchange Rate, no adjustment to the Exchange Rate will be made.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.05, no adjustment shall be made thereunder, nor shall an adjustment be made to the ability of a holder of a Note to exchange, for any distribution described therein if the holder will otherwise participate in the distribution without exchange of such holder's Notes.
(g) The Company may (but is not required to) make such increases in the Exchange Rate, in addition to those required by clauses (a) through (e) of this Section 14.05 as the Company's Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or any similar event treated as such for income tax purposes.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Exchange Rate by any amount for any period of at least 20 days if the Company's Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive.
(h) All calculations under this Article 14 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. The Company will not be required to make an adjustment in the Exchange Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Exchange Rate. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Exchange Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon redemption, upon a Fundamental Change or upon the Stated Maturity.
To the extent the Notes become exchangeable into cash, assets or property (other than capital stock of the Issuer or securities to which Section 14.06 or 14.07 applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter pursuant to this Section 14.05 as to the cash, assets or property.
(i) Whenever the Exchange Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Exchange Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Exchange Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Exchange Rate and may assume that the last Exchange Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Exchange Rate setting forth the adjusted Exchange Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective.
The Company or, at the Company's request after the Company has prepared and delivered such notice to the Trustee, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the holders of the adjustment to the Exchange Rate in the manner provided in Section 16.03, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information by publication on the Company's Web site or through such other public medium as it may use at such time. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(j) In any case in which this Section 14.05 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Stock Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 14.05(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 14.05(b) or (4) the Expiration Time for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 14.05(e), (each a ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note exchanged after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such exchange by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such exchange before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 14.03. For purposes of this Section 14.05(j), the term "" shall mean:
Determination Date
Adjustment Event
(i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
(iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
(iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
(k) For purposes of this Section 14.05, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Issuer but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Issuer will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Issuer. The Issuer shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Issuer.
Section 14.06. . If any of the following events occur (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination to which Section 14.05(c) applies), (ii) any consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination of the Issuer with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii) any sale, lease, conveyance or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Issuer and the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that each Note shall be exchangeable into the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property (and in the same proportion) receivable (the "") upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exchange of such Notes (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock are available to exchange all such Notes) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
Applicable Consideration
non-electing
"), then for the purposes of this Section 14.06 the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for provisions and adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the provisions and adjustments provided for in this Article 14.
share
The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each holder of Notes, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.05 of this Indenture, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
In addition, any issuer of securities included in the Applicable Consideration shall execute an amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement (to the extent any Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined therein) remain outstanding) to make the provisions thereof apply to such securities.
The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, binding share exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances.
For purposes of determining the Exchange Value as provided in Section 14.04 the following provisions shall apply: (i) if the Applicable Consideration includes securities for which the price can be determined in a manner contemplated by the definition of "Last Reported Sale Price," then the value of such securities shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the "Last Reported Sale Price;" (ii) if the Applicable Consideration includes other property (other than securities or cash), then the value of such property shall be the fair market value of such property as determined by the Company's Board of Directors in good faith; and (iii) if the Applicable Consideration includes cash, then the value of such cash shall be the amount thereof.
If this Section 14.06 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 14.05 shall not apply. Notwithstanding this Section 14.06, if a Public Acquirer Change of Control occurs and the Company elects to adjust the Exchange Rate and its exchange obligation pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section 14.07, the provisions of Section 14.07 shall apply to such Public Acquirer Change of Control instead of this Section 14.06.
Section 14.07.
Exchange After a Public Acquirer Change of Control.
(a) In the event of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may, in lieu of increasing the Exchange Rate by Additional Shares pursuant to Section 14.01(e), elect (subject to the satisfaction of the provisions of this Section 14.07) to adjust the Exchange Rate and the related exchange obligation such that from and after the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, holders will be entitled to exchange their Notes, in accordance with Section 14.02 hereof (subject to the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 14.01) into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock by adjusting the Exchange Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Change of Control by multiplying it by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be (A) in the case of a share exchange, consolidation, merger or binding share exchange, pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property, the average value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined by the Company's Board of Directors in the manner contemplated by Section 14.06) paid or payable per share of Common Stock or (B) in the case of any other Public Acquirer Change of Control, the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control.
(b) In order to make the election pursuant to this Section 14.07, the Company and the issuer of the Public Acquirer Common Stock shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that each Note shall be exchangeable into Public Acquirer Common Stock and execute an amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement (to the extent any Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined therein) remain outstanding) to make the provisions thereof apply to the Public Acquirer Common Stock. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for provisions and adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the provisions and adjustments provided for in this Article 14.
(c) The Company will notify holders of its election by providing notice as set forth in Section 14.01(c) promptly after making the election pursuant to this Section 14.07.
Section 14.08. . The issue of stock certificates on exchanges of Notes shall be made without charge to the exchanging Noteholder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the holder of any Note exchanged, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Shares Issued
Section 14.09. . (a) The Issuer shall reserve and provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury by the Issuer, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for exchange of the Notes from time to time and shall contribute such shares to the Company for delivery to holders upon exchange of the Notes. The Issuer further agrees that it will not engage in any transactions (including, without limitation, making any dividends or distributions, issuing any rights or warrants, or making any tender offer) which would require an adjustment to the Exchange Rate as provided in this Section 14.09 until the Issuer has complied with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.
Reservation of Shares, Shares to Be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock
(b) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment increasing the Exchange Rate to an amount that would cause the Exchange Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the Notes, the Issuer will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Exchange Rate.
(c) The Company and the Issuer covenant that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon exchange of Notes shall have been duly authorized and upon issue and delivery in accordance with the terms of this Indenture shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable by the Issuer and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
The Company and the Issuer covenant that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of exchange of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon exchange, the Company and the Issuer will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be. In connection with any transaction referred to in Sections 14.06 or 14.07, the Company and any other Person required to issue common stock upon exchange of a Note shall take such actions as are required so that Section 3(a)(9) or another exemption under the Securities Act can be relied upon in connection with such exchange of the Notes to permit such exchange without requiring registration thereof under the Securities Act or provide for the registration of such exchange under the Securities Act.
The Issuer further covenants that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq National Market or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Issuer will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the
Notes; that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Issuer to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first exchange of the Notes into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the Notes in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.
provided
Section 14.10. . The Trustee and any other Exchange Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to the Company or any holder of Notes to determine the Exchange Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Exchange Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Exchange Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the exchange of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Exchange Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Exchange Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of exchange or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 14. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Exchange Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 14.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the exchange of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 14.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
Responsibility of Trustee
Section 14.11. . In case:
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
(a) The Issuer shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Exchange Rate pursuant to Section 14.05; or
(b) The Issuer shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; or
(c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Issuer (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Issuer is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Issuer is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Issuer or the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each holder of Notes at his address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 2.05 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.
Section 14.12. . To the extent that the Issuer has a rights plan in effect upon exchange of the Notes, the Noteholder will receive, in addition to the Common Stock, if any, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any exchange, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Exchange Rate will be adjusted at
Stockholder Rights Plan
the time of separation as if the Issuer distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of the Issuer's capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 14.04(c) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Issuer may amend such applicable stockholder rights agreement to provide that upon exchange of the Notes the holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such exchange, the rights which would have attached to such Common Stock if the rights had not become separated from the Common Stock under such applicable stockholder rights agreement.
Section 15.01. . (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 15, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, jointly and severally, on a senior basis to each holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (i) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of all obligations of the Company under this Indenture (including obligations to the Trustee) and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on the Notes, delivery of the Settlement Amount and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Notes and (ii) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company whether for fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise under this Indenture and the Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the ""). Subject to Section 15.02, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors further agree that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from either the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors, and that the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall remain bound under this Article 15 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.
Guarantees
Guaranteed Obligations
(b) To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors waive presentation to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waive notice of protest for nonpayment. The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors waive notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (iv) the release of any security held by any holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (v) the failure of any holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (vi) any change in the ownership of the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors, except as provided in Section 15.02(b).
(c) The Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
(d) Except as expressly set forth in Section 15.02, the obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors or would otherwise operate as a discharge of the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors as a matter of law or equity.
(e) The Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantors agree that its respective Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations. The Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees
that its Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.

No adjustment in respect of Interest on any Note exchanged (other than the payment of Additional Interest, if any) or dividends on any shares issued upon exchange of such Note will be made upon any exchange except as set forth in the next sentence. If this Note (or portion hereof) is surrendered for exchange during the period from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any record date for the payment of Interest to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Interest Payment Date, this Note (or portion hereof being exchanged) must be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the Interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Principal Amount being exchanged; that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date or (3) to the extent of any overdue Interest, if any overdue Interest exists at the time of exchange with respect to such Note.
provided
No fractional shares will be issued upon any exchange, but an adjustment and payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Note or Notes for exchange.
A Note in respect of which a holder is exercising its right to require repurchase upon a Fundamental Change or repurchase on a Repurchase Date may be exchanged only if such holder withdraws its election to exercise such right in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate Principal Amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange thereof, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

Guarantee
Subject to the provisions of this Article 2, O'Reilly, as Guarantor, hereby unconditionally guarantees to each holder of a Note that the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee hereunder, thereunder and under the Indenture will be promptly paid in full or performed, as the case may be, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed, as the case may be, for whatever reason, the Guarantor will be obligated to pay or perform the same, as the case may be, immediately. The Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
The Guarantor hereby confirms that it is its intention that this guarantee of the Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of applicable bankruptcy laws, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Subordinated Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the obligations of the Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, result in the obligations of the Guarantor under this Subordinated Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
. Payments under this Subordinated Guarantee shall be subordinated to the prior payment in full of all Guarantor Other Indebtedness (defined below) as follows:
Section 2.02
Subordination of Guarantee
No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of O'Reilly under this Subordinated Guarantee with respect to any of the obligations on the Notes (a "") will be made, and no action against the Guarantor may be brought, if, at the time of such payment or the bringing of such action, there exists a default in the payment in cash of all or any portion of the principal of, or interest, if any, on any Guarantor Other Indebtedness when due, or any Guarantor Other Indebtedness has been accelerated, and such default shall not have been cured or waived in writing or the benefits of this sentence waived in writing by or on behalf of the holders of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness. In addition, during the continuance of any non-payment event of default with respect to any Guarantor Other Indebtedness, and upon receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee of written notice, referring to the Indenture and entitled "Payment Blockage Notice" (a "Payment Blockage Notice"), from the holder or holders of any Guarantor Other Indebtedness, then, unless and until such event of default has been cured or waived in writing or has ceased to exist or any Guarantor Other Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash (or such payment shall be duly provided for in a manner satisfactory to holders of any Guarantor Other Indebtedness) or otherwise to the extent holders of any Guarantor Other Indebtedness in their sole discretion accept satisfaction of amounts due by settlement in other than cash or the benefits of these provisions have been waived in writing by the holders of any Guarantor Other Indebtedness, no Note Payment will be made to such holders during a period (a "") commencing on the date of such receipt of the Payment Blockage Notice by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee and ending 364 days thereafter. The Trustee shall deliver a copy of the Payment Blockage Notice to O'Reilly as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Note Payment shall be received by the Trustee at a time when such payment is prohibited hereunder, such Note Payment shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of any Guarantor Other Indebtedness, as their respective interests may appear.
Note Payment
Payment Blockage Period
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of O'Reilly of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to the creditors of O'Reilly upon any dissolution or winding-up or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of O'Reilly, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceedings relating to O'Reilly, any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshalling of O'Reilly's assets and liabilities, the holders of Guarantor Other Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all obligations due in respect of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness or have provision made for such payment in a manner acceptable to holders of Guarantor Other Indebtedness, before the holders of the Notes or the Trustee on behalf of such holders shall be entitled to bring any action against O'Reilly with respect to this Subordinated Guarantee.
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision prohibiting such payment or distribution, any payment or distribution of assets or securities of O'Reilly of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities in respect of the principal, or interest on the Notes, shall be
 
received by the Trustee or any Paying Agent or any holder of Notes at a time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by this Subordinated Guarantee such payment or distribution shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Guarantor Other Indebtedness, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all obligations in respect of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all obligations in respect of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness have been paid in full in cash (or such payment shall be duly provided for in a manner satisfactory to the holders of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness) or otherwise to the extent holders of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness in their sole discretion accept satisfaction of amounts due by settlement in other than cash after giving effect to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders of such Guarantor Other Indebtedness.
O'Reilly shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to O'Reilly which would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution to or by the Trustee in respect of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Subordinated Guarantee. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any default or event of default with respect to Guarantor Other Indebtedness or of any other facts which would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution to or by the Trustee unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received notice in writing at its Corporate Trust Office to that effect signed by an Officer of O'Reilly, or by a holder of Guarantor Other Indebtedness or agent therefor; and prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively assume that no such facts exist; , , that if the Trustee shall not have received such notice at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms of the Subordinated Guarantee any moneys shall become payable to any Noteholder for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note), then, regardless of anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive any moneys from O'Reilly and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after such prior date. The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself or itself to be a holder of Guarantor Other Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of, or agent or other representative of, such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Guarantor Other Indebtedness or a trustee or agent or representative on behalf of any such holder. A holder of Guarantor Other Indebtedness and any agent on behalf of such holder shall be entitled to deliver all notices required by this Subordinated Guarantee to the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Guarantor Other Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Subordinated Guarantee, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Guarantor Other Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Subordinated Guarantee, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. No right of any present or future holders of Guarantor Other Indebtedness to enforce subordination as provided herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of O'Reilly or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by O'Reilly with the terms of the Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this Subordinated Guarantee are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Guarantor Other Indebtedness.
