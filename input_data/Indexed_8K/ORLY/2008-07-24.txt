Diluted earnings per common share for the first six months of 2008 increased 1.1% to $0.88 on 116.4 million shares compared to $0.87 a year ago on 115.9 million shares.

Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.4% and 1.5% for the second quarter and first six months of 2008, respectively.  Comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2007 were 2.0% and 4.3%, respectively.
 
"We are very proud of the continued high levels of customer service provided by Team O'Reilly that enabled us to achieve solid 3.4% comparable store sales growth this quarter," Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President stated.  "We're also very excited about the potential of our acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation and the opportunity to optimize our very complementary business models including the
 
implementation of our dual-market strategy in CSK's markets.  On July 11th, O'Reilly and CSK became one team of 40,000 members, operating over 3,200 stores in 38 states and we're looking very forward to beginning the integration process and working together to become an even more dominant force in the auto parts business in the western half of the U.S."
 
"In addition to opening 51 stores during the second quarter, we continued to prepare for the opening of our newest distribution center in Lubbock this fall," stated Ted Wise, COO and Co-President. "Our team continues to focus on the fundamentals of providing industry leading customer service to our Professional Installer and do-it-yourself customers in all our markets.  We're very proud of the quality of our sales growth during the quarter, which was highlighted by a 10.4% increase in gross margin."
 
The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2008, to range from $1.50 to $1.54.  Excluding the expected impact of one-time charges relating to the CSK acquisition of $0.07 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per share are expected to range from $1.57 to $1.61.  Anticipated one-time charges relating to the CSK acquisition include a prepayment penalty of $6.4 million associated with repayment of existing O'Reilly debt in conjunction with the acquisition, financing costs of $4.2 million related to an interim financing facility and estimated severance costs of $3 million.  The impact of the acquisition of CSK, excluding the one-time items presented above, is expected to dilute 2008 earnings by approximately $0.15 per diluted share, and this impact is reflected in both the diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS ranges provided above.  The Company continues to expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in 2009 and to realize ongoing synergies of $100 million annually beginning in 2010.
 
Comparable store sales for the second-half of 2008 are estimated to range from 2% to 4% for existing O'Reilly stores and (3%) to (1%) for CSK stores for a combined Company range of 0% to 2%.  Full year comparable store sales are estimated to range from 2% to 3% for existing O'Reilly stores and (3%) to (1%) for CSK stores for a combined Company full year range of 0% to 2%.  CSK's historical comparable store sales from May 5, 2008 to July 11, 2008, reflecting the period from the end of CSK's most recently reported fiscal quarter to the date of acquisition, were (1.6%).
