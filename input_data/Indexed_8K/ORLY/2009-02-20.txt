Gross profit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, increased to $515 million (or 46.2% of sales) from $270 million (or 44.7% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 91%. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $435 million (or 39.0% of sales) from $207 million (or 34.2% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 110%.
Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, totaled $42.7 million, up 5.2% from $40.6 million for the same period in 2007. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, decreased 8.6% to $0.32 on 135.4 million shares versus $0.35 a year ago on 116.3 million shares.
"We are very pleased to report strong sales results amid these very challenging economic times. Our consolidated comparable store sales growth during the fourth quarter was a strong 4.0%," said Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. "We are encouraged with the positive CSK same store sales of 0.8% for the quarter, making this the first positive same store sales quarter for CSK since the third quarter of 2005. The integration of CSK is progressing well and we remain confident in the strength and potential benefits of the combined companies. We're also very encouraged with the 6.2% same store sales increase in the core O'Reilly' stores."
For the year ended December 31, 2008, sales increased $1.05 billion, or 42%, to $3.58 billion from $2.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased to $1.63 billion (or 45.5% of sales) from $1.12 billion (or 44.4% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of 45%. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased to $1.29 billion (or 36.1% of sales) from $815 million (or 32.3% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of 59%.

Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased 11.4% to $1.48 on 125.4 million shares versus $1.67 a year ago on 116.1 million shares.
The Company's fourth quarter and full year results include charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK Automotive, Inc ("CSK"). Fourth quarter charges are included in SG&A and include a one-time charge of $9.6 million to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O'Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK's trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over approximately two years coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations to O'Reilly branded locations. The full-year results include the items described above and one-time third quarter charges for the prepayment and extinguishments of existing O'Reilly debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility and an adjustment to tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of acquisition related charges in the fourth quarter of 2008, increased 5.7% to $0.37 from the same period one year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2008, adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of acquisition related charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, decreased 1.8% to $1.64 from the same period one year ago. The impact of the individual acquisition related charges, net of tax, was as follows:
 
Comparable store sales for O'Reilly stores open at least one year increased 6.2% and 2.6% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Comparable store sales for CSK stores open at least one year increased 0.8% for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, and decreased 1.7% for the portion of CSK's sales in 2008 since the July 11 acquisition. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.0% and 1.5% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively.
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all 40,735 members of Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication throughout 2008; our continued success is a result of their commitment to providing the best customer service in our industry." Henslee added, "Looking to the remainder of this year, we are excited about the opportunities to continue to grow our market share as we convert our CSK stores to the O'Reilly brand."
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "We opened 27 net, new stores, converted 51 CSK stores to the O'Reilly brand and merged 19 CSK stores with O'Reilly stores during the fourth quarter. Our total combined store count for 2008 was 3,285 stores, which included 150 net, new core O'Reilly stores. Our new distribution center in Lubbock, Texas opened in November, which allows us greater growth within that region as well as the ability to convert CSK store locations in the El Paso and New Mexico markets. We have purchased existing distribution facilities in metropolitan Denver and Los Angeles and have signed a purchase agreement for a distribution center in the Seattle area. These are the first of four anticipated distribution centers in the western portion of the United States, which are essential to the implementation of our dual-market strategy in the CSK markets. During 2009, we will continue to focus on our CSK conversion plan, as well as open 150 new stores and a distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina. I would also like to recognize the members of the store conversion teams who braved the cold winter weather of the Northern Plains to convert CSK stores, your dedication is an inspiration and is a true example of the O'Reilly culture at work."
The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 to range from $0.35 to $0.39 and estimates diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2009, to range from $1.80 to $1.84. Excluding the expected impact of acquisition charges related to CSK of $.01 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.36 to $0.40 for first quarter of 2009. Excluding the expected impact of acquisition charges for trade names and trademarks related to CSK of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2009, adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $1.83 to $1.87.
