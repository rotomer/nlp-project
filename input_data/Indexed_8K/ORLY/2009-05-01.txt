FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced record revenues and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Springfield, MO, April 29, 2009
Sales for the three months ended March 31, 2009, totaled $1.16 billion, up 80% from $0.65 billion for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2009 increased to $0.54 billion (or 46.6% of sales) from $0.29 billion (or 44.6% of sales) for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 88%. Selling, General and Administrative expenses increased to $0.43 billion (or 36.9% of sales) for the first quarter of 2009 from $0.21 billion (or 33.2% of sales) for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 100%.
Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, totaled $63 million, up 36% from $46 million for the same period in 2008. Diluted earnings per common share for the first quarter of 2009 increased 15.0% to $0.46 on 136.2 million shares compared to $0.40 for the first quarter of 2008 on 116.3 million shares.
Commenting on the Company's quarterly results, Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President stated, "We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, highlighted by consolidated comparable store sales growth of 5.7% and a 200 basis point improvement in our gross profit as a percent of sales. Our O'Reilly branded stores performed exceptionally well throughout the quarter, finishing with comparable store sales of 8.2%. We are excited to report our second consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales growth in the recently acquired CSK branded stores as well. The solid sales performance is a result of our Team's combined effort to provide the best customer service in our business supported by improved product mix in the CSK branded stores. We have received very encouraging feedback from our CSK Store Managers who continue to see the benefits of these inventory enhancements."
The Company's first quarter results include a charge related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK Automotive, Inc. ("CSK"). The non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK's trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over approximately two years to coincide with the anticipated conversion of CSK branded store locations to O'Reilly branded locations, is included in SG&A. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charge, increased 17.5% to $0.47 from the same period one year ago. The impact of the acquisition related charge, net of tax, was as follows:
 
Comparable store sales for O'Reilly branded stores open at least one year increased 8.2% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009. Comparable store sales for CSK branded stores open at least one year increased 1.5% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 5.7% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
"With the opening of 52 net new stores during the quarter, our total store count at March 31 grew to 3,337 stores," Ted Wise, COO and Co-President stated. "Our dedicated store conversion Team Members converted 93 CSK branded stores to the O'Reilly brand over the quarter and in mid-April, we successfully converted CSK's existing Detroit distribution center to the O'Reilly system. In conjunction with converting the DC, we converted the 79 Murray's stores it supports to the O'Reilly point of sale system, and we are excited to see the positive effect nightly deliveries will have on these stores." Mr. Wise added, "We are on schedule for the May opening of our new distribution center in Greensboro, North Carolina, which will support much of this year's new store expansion. All our stores remain focused on providing the best customer service in the industry as we work to complete the CSK integration and look forward to growing the O'Reilly brand across the country."
The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2009 to range from $0.50 to $0.54 and estimates diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2009, to range from $1.89 to $1.93. Excluding the expected impact of acquisition charges related to CSK of $0.01 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.55 for second quarter of 2009. Excluding the expected impact of acquisition charges for trade names and trademarks related to CSK of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2009, adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $1.92 to $1.96.
