O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into an interest rate swap transaction (the "Swap Transaction") on January 21, 2010, with Barclays Capital ("Barclays"). The Company entered into the Swap Transaction to mitigate the interest rate risk on an additional $50 million of the Company's outstanding floating rate debt under its Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto, dated as of July 11, 2008 (as amended, the "Credit Facility"). The Swap Transaction has an effective date of January 22, 2010, and a maturity date of January 31, 2011. Under the terms of the Swap Transaction, the Company is required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on a notional amount of $50 million at a fixed rate of 0.525% and the counterparty is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on the same referenced notional amount. The Swap Transaction effectively fixes the annual interest rate on $50 million of the Company's debt, which exists under the Credit Facility, at a rate of 0.525%, plus an applicable margin under the terms of the Credit Facility. Notwithstanding the terms of the Swap Transaction, the Company is ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the Credit Facility. The Company may enter into additional swap transactions in the future from time to time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
