O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY) today announced record revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009, representing 17 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales increases for O'Reilly since becoming a public company in April of 1993.
Springfield, MO, February 17, 2010 
Sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, totaled $1.17 billion, up 5% from $1.11 billion for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, increased to $570 million (or 48.5% of sales) from $515 million (or 46.2% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 11%. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, increased to $444 million (or 37.8% of sales) from $435 million (or 39.0% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 2%.
Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, totaled $72 million, up 68% from $43 million for the same period in 2008. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, increased 63% to $0.52 on 139 million shares versus $0.32 a year ago on 135.4 million shares.
Commenting on the Company's quarter and year-end results, Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President, stated, "We are pleased to report double-digit earnings growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% to $0.52 for the fourth quarter and increased 38% to $2.26 for the year. During the fourth quarter, we saw comparable store sales growth from both the core O'Reilly and acquired CSK stores. These sales gains, along with continued improvements in our gross margin, have been the catalyst for our strong earnings. Stores operating on the O'Reilly systems generated a comparable store sales increase of 2.4%, while stores operating on the legacy CSK system added a solid 3.5% increase. The O'Reilly systems comparable store sales results consisted of a 3.1% increase for the core O'Reilly and post conversion Schuck's stores, an 8.5% increase from the 123 converted Checker stores and an 11% decrease in comparable store sales from the 141 converted Murray's stores. We entered the next phase of our CSK integration plan with the opening of our Seattle, Washington, distribution center [DC] in November and we successfully converted 141 Schuck's stores to the O'Reilly systems following that opening. We remain confident that implementing our dual market strategy in the western half of the country will allow our acquired CSK stores to continue to gain market share and enable them to contribute positively to the profitable growth of O'Reilly."
For the year ended December 31, 2009, sales increased $1.27 billion, or 36%, to $4.85 billion from $3.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased to $2.33 billion (or 48.0% of sales) from $1.63 billion (or 45.5% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an increase of 43%. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased to $1.79 billion (or 36.9% of sales) from $1.29 billion (or 36.1% of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an increase of 38%.
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $307 million, an increase of 65% from $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 51% to $2.23 on 137.9 million shares versus $1.48 a year ago on 125.4 million shares.
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, remarked, "We began 2009 with 3,285 stores, 18 distribution centers, and a plan for aggressive growth. By the end of the year, we increased our store count to 3,421 and our distribution center count to 20, with three more distribution centers to open in the first half of 2010. We have made significant progress with the CSK integration in the past year, including the completion of 141 Murray's store conversions, 72 Checkers store conversions in the Upper Midwest, 141 Schuck's store conversions in the Upper Northwest, conversion of our Detroit distribution center and the opening of our Seattle distribution center. Following the November opening of our Seattle DC, we began converting Schuck's stores at a rate of approximately 30 stores per week, which progressed smoothly. In January of 2010, we opened Moreno Valley, California, the second of our planned four additional DCs in the western markets, and we began converting approximately 30 Kragen stores per week to our distribution model. Our dedicated store conversion teams will work to continue this rate of conversions throughout most of 2010. The two remaining additional DCs are scheduled to open in Denver, Colorado, in March and in Salt Lake City, Utah, in May of this year. We will also relocate our current DC in Dixon, California, to Stockton, California, and convert our Phoenix, Arizona, DC to O'Reilly systems in the second half of 2010."
The Company's results for the year ended December 31, 2008, included one-time and non-cash charges related to the July 11, 2008, acquisition of CSK Automotive, Inc. ("CSK"). These charges included one-time costs for prepayment and extinguishment of our existing debt, commitment fees for an unused interim financing facility, a one-time adjustment to the tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of CSK, a one-time charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O'Reilly policy and a non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK's trade names and trademarks, which will be amortized over a period coinciding with the anticipated conversion of CSK store locations. The Company's fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, results included the charge to conform the CSK team member vacation policy with the O'Reilly policy and the non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK's trade names and trademarks. The Company's fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009, results also included the non-cash charge to amortize the value assigned to CSK's trade names and trademarks. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the acquisition related charges, increased 41% to $0.52 for the fourth quarter of 2009 from $0.37 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the acquisition related charges for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share data):

Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period the CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the O'Reilly systems increased 2.4% and 5.4% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Comparable store sales for stores operating on the legacy CSK system increased 3.5% and 3.0% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 2.7% and 4.6% for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009, respectively.
Mr. Wise added, "I would like to thank all 45,000 members of Team O'Reilly for the hard work and dedication they have shown throughout the year to move forward our integration and growth goals. As we continue with our progress, our focus remains on the fundamentals of providing the best customer service in the industry to our DIFM and DIY customers in all of the markets we serve and we look forward to an outstanding year in 2010."
The Company estimates diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2010 to range from $0.56 to $0.60 and estimates diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010, to range from $2.50 to $2.56.
The Company estimates consolidated comparable store sales for the first quarter of 2010 to range from 2.0% to 4.0%. The Company estimates consolidated comparable store sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, to range from 3.0% to 5.0%
Mr. Henslee added, "As a result of our team's hard work, dedication and commitment to providing the best customer service in our industry, we have exceeded our stated goal of achieving $4 billion in sales by the end of 2010, a full year early. Looking forward to 2010, we see consumer concerns over high unemployment and a challenging macro environment as signs that our customers will continue to maintain their current vehicles and, therefore, drive demand in our industry. We are very encouraged with the opportunities we have to grow our market share as we continue to expand our distribution infrastructure in the Western United States and continue the conversion of our CSK stores to the O'Reilly Brand."
