Item 8.01    Other Events
As previously reported, on May 8, 2009, Joseph C. Greene, an independent director of the Company, passed away. On May 19, 2009, the Company received a written notification from the staff at The NASDAQ Stock Market ("Nasdaq") indicating that, as a result of Mr. Greene's death, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) ("Rule 5605(b)(1)"). Rule 5605(b)(1) requires that a majority of the board of directors must be comprised of Independent Directors. At that time, the Company had eight directors, only four of which qualified as independent directors. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), the Company had a "cure period" of until the next annual shareholders' meeting or May 8, 2010 to regain compliance.
On May 4, 2010, Thomas T. Hendrickson was elected as a Class II Director of the Company at the Annual Meeting. With the election of Thomas T. Hendrickson at the Annual Meeting, five of the Company's nine Directors qualify as Independent Directors under Nasdaq requirements. On May 5, 2010, the Company received a written notification from the staff at Nasdaq confirming that the Company is in full compliance with Rule 5605(b)(1), and stating that this matter is now closed.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
