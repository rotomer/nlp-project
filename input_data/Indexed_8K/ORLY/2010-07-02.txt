% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the "notes"), which were originally issued by CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK"), are now exchangeable at the option of the holders and will remain exchangeable through September 30, 2010, the last trading day of the current fiscal quarter, as provided for in the Indenture governing the notes. In connection with its acquisition of CSK, O'Reilly agreed to guarantee the notes, on a subordinated basis, and to issue shares of O'Reilly common stock, if any, upon any exchange of the principal amount of the notes.
The notes became exchangeable as the Company's common stock closed at or above 130% of the Exchange Price (as defined in the Indenture governing the notes) for 20 trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on June 30, 2010. As a result, during the exchange period commencing July 1, 2010, and continuing through and including September 30, 2010, for each $1,000 principal amount of the notes held, holders of the notes may, if they elect, surrender their notes for exchange. The Company expects to settle each note surrendered for exchange with cash in an amount equal to $1,000 in cash and shares of O'Reilly common stock in excess thereof, subject to the terms of the Indenture. The notes currently have the entire $100 million principal amount outstanding.
