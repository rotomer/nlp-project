Quarter Financial Results
Sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, totaled $1.38 billion, up 10% from $1.25 billion for the same period a year ago. Gross profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, increased to $673 million (or 48.7% of sales) from $604 million (or 48.2% of sales) for the second quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 11%. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to $476 million (or 34.5% of sales) for the second quarter of 2010 from $454 million (or 36.3% of sales) for the second quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 5%. Operating income increased to $181 million (or 13.1% of sales) for the second quarter of 2010 from $150 million (or 12.0% of sales), representing an increase of 21%.
Net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, totaled $100 million, up 16% from $86 million for the same period in 2009. Diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter of 2010 increased 15% to $0.71 on 141.1 million shares compared to $0.62 for the second quarter of 2009 on 137.5 million shares.
The Company's second quarter and year-to-date results include a charge related to the ongoing, legacy United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") investigation of CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK"). As previously announced, prior to O'Reilly's acquisition of CSK in July of 2008, the DOJ began an investigation of CSK relating to CSK's historical accounting practices. The charge of $15 million in the second quarter of 2010 represents an increase in the accrual for the estimated costs to resolve the DOJ investigation, including potential settlement-related payments to the DOJ, future costs of cooperation with the DOJ, and associated legal and documentation costs; however, there can be no assurance that the discussions with the DOJ will result in a resolution of these matters within the amount currently accrued by O'Reilly.
Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, increased 31% to $196 million (or 14.2% of sales) for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, from $150 million (or 12.0% of sales) for the same period a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, increased 31% to $0.81 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, from $0.62 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the charge for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 (in thousands, except per share data):
"We are pleased with our ability to continue to drive both comparable store sales and profitability above the solid performance in the second quarter of 2009," commented Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. "The outstanding execution of our team in the second quarter resulted in a comparable store sales growth of 7.9%, a 220 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin and a double-digit increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 31%. July 11th marked the two-year anniversary of the CSK acquisition and Team O'Reilly's unwavering commitment to the execution of our integration plan has been a key driver of our success to date. Throughout the integration process, our Team Members have remained dedicated to living our Culture of customer service and teamwork in both our existing as well as converted stores."

Sales for the first six months of 2010 totaled $2.66 billion, up 10% from $2.42 billion for the same period a year ago.

Operating income for the first six months of 2010 increased to $350 million (or 13.1% of sales) from $263 million (or 10.9% of sales) for the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 33%.

Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, increased 40% to $1.51 for the first six months of 2010, from $1.08 for the same period one year ago. The table below outlines the impact of the charge for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (in thousands, except per share data):
"During the first half of 2010, we delivered solid top-line growth, improved profitability and achieved record earnings," added Mr. Henslee. "The consistency and strength of our results truly emphasize the power of our proven dual market strategy and the tremendous talent we possess throughout our Company. We remained focused on gaining market share by continuing to provide the highest level of parts availability and service in the industry, while relentlessly controlling costs. We are encouraged by the solid performance in the first half of 2010, and we look forward to sustaining our momentum and building upon our successes for the remainder of the year."

Quarter and Year-to-Date Comparable Store Sales Results
Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to team members and sales during the one to two week period certain CSK branded stores were closed for conversion. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.9% for the second quarter of 2010 versus 4.8% for the second quarter of 2009. Consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 7.4% for the first six months of 2010 versus 5.2% for the first six months of 2009.
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President commented on the Company's second quarter results. "The CSK system conversion process continued on schedule in the second quarter with the successful opening of our DC in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the conversion of 102 CSK stores to the O'Reilly systems. In addition to the CSK conversion activities, we opened 24 stores in the second quarter, which brings our total to 73 new stores for the first half of this year. As previously announced, we continue to expect to open a total of 150 new stores in 2010. We are on track to relocate our Dixon, California, DC to Stockton, California, in September, which will allow for the conversion of an additional 274 CSK stores. With the planned conversion of our final DC in Phoenix, Arizona, to the O'Reilly systems in November, we will convert the remaining 151 CSK stores to the O'Reilly systems by the end of 2010."
Mr. Wise added, "We are excited by the company's growth, and are anxious to see the completion of the CSK integration process in 2011. Our performance in the first half of this year would not have been possible without the efforts of our 46,000 Team Members and our continued success is a testament to their dedication and hard work."
