The Company's third quarter and year-to-date results include charges related to the legacy United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") investigation of CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK"). As previously announced, prior to O'Reilly's acquisition of CSK in July of 2008, the DOJ began an investigation of CSK relating to CSK's historical accounting practices. O'Reilly and the DOJ have now agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK's legacy accounting practices. Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, the Company has recorded an additional charge of $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to increase its accrual in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement and the Company paying a one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million to the DOJ. 
Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, increased 37% to $205 million (or 14.4% of sales) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, from $149 million (or 11.9% of sales) for the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the charge related to the CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, increased 37% to $0.86 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, from $0.63 for the third quarter of 2009. The table below outlines the impact of the charge for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 (in thousands, except per share data): 
Commenting on the quarterly results, Greg Henslee, O'Reilly's Co-President and CEO stated, "We are extremely pleased to announce an exceptionally strong comparable store sales increase of 11.1% for the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Sales for the quarter were positively influenced by warmer weather conditions across most of our markets as well as the ongoing strong demand for our products. The macro environment remains favorable for our business and our Team Members continue to consistently provide unparalleled levels of customer service. We were able to leverage our strong top-line performance with a continued commitment to the execution of our CSK integration plan and a relentless attention to expense control to deliver a 250 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin resulting in our 7 consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth."   
th
Ted Wise, O'Reilly's Co-President and COO stated, "In the third quarter, we began the relocation of our Dixon, California, distribution center [DC] to a new, larger facility in Stockton, California, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we successfully completed the conversion of stores serviced by the new DC. In addition, we opened 48 new stores during the quarter, putting us on track to open our projected 150 new stores in 2010. For 2011, our projection is to open approximately 170 new stores. Our strong performance during the quarter was again the result of the hard work and dedication of our Team Members, and we wanted to take this opportunity to thank each of them for their contribution to O'Reilly's continued success."

Our focus remains on our core Culture values of excellent customer service and professionalism as we complete the integration of the acquired CSK stores and continue to build on the solid foundations we have established in our western markets."

With the support of the enhanced distribution model now in place in all of our western markets, we will continue to implement our proven dual market strategy in every market we serve, backed by the excellent customer service and teamwork of our 47,000 Team Members."
