Underwriting Agreement
On January 11, 2011, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as the representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters"), and the Guarantors (as defined below) party thereto, with respect to the Company's issuance and sale of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company and the Guarantors also have agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities.
The estimated net proceeds from the offering of the Notes was approximately $492 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness, which was approximately $356 million as of December 31, 2010, under the Company's asset based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Facility"), that was entered into by the Company on July 11, 2008, and arranged by Bank of America, N.A. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes.
Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, was a lender under the Company's ABL Facility and received a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes in connection with repayment of borrowings under the ABL Facility. Some of the Underwriters or their affiliates also are parties to or lenders under the Credit Agreement (as defined below).
The above description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference.
Indenture
The terms of the Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of January 14, 2011 (the "Closing Date"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors and UMB Bank, N.A. (the "Trustee").
The Notes will mature on January 14, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 4.875% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2011. The Notes will be the Company's general unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each
of the Company's subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") that incurs or guarantees the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) or certain other debt of the Company or any of the Guarantors. As of the Closing Date, all of the Company's subsidiaries are Guarantors of the Notes. The Company will be permitted to release guarantees of the Notes without the consent of holders of the Notes under the circumstances described in the Indenture.
Prior to October 14, 2020, the Company may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the Indenture. On or after October 14, 2020, the Company may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date.
If the Company undergoes a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the repurchase date.
The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on its assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of its property, in each case as set forth in the Indenture. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Indenture contains other customary terms, including, but not limited to, events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.
The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions including, among others, the following: (i) default in the payment of the principal of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable; (ii) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; (iii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice, (iv) a default under any debt for money borrowed by the Company or any of the Guarantors that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $75.0 million without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the trustee or holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding; and (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, in each case as set forth in the Indenture. In the case of an event of default, other than a bankruptcy default with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if the notice is given by the holders of the Notes), may declare the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. In the case of any bankruptcy-related event of default with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes shall be immediately due and payable without any act on the part of the Trustee or holders of the Notes.
The Trustee is also an underwriter in the Notes offering and a lender under the Credit Agreement.
The offering of the Notes was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which became automatically effective upon filing with Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, 2011 (File No. 333-171644).
The above description of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the Form of Note, attached as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Credit Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Company entered into a new senior unsecured credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and a Lender, and the other lenders party thereto (the "Credit Agreement").
The Credit Agreement establishes a $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in January 2016, with a $200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. The Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility that permits the Company, subject to certain conditions, to increase the commitments under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility by up to $200 million; provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments does not exceed $950 million at any time.
Loans made under the Credit Agreement (other than swing line loans) will bear interest, at the Company's option, at either a Base Rate (as set forth in the Credit Agreement) or a Eurodollar Rate (as set forth in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin that will vary from 0.325% to 1.500% in the case of Base Rate loans and 1.325% to 2.500% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans, in each case based upon the ratings assigned to the Company's debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. Borrowings of swing line loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a Base Rate plus the margin described above for Base Rate loans. In addition, we expect to pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments. That percentage will vary from 0.175% to 0.500% based upon the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement will be guaranteed by its subsidiaries, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries to the extent adverse tax consequences will not result from such guaranty. As of the Closing Date, all of the Company's subsidiaries are guarantors under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains negative and affirmative covenants applicable to the Company and its existing and future subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions, including carve-outs and baskets), including, without limitation, negative covenants that, subject to customary exceptions, restrict the Company's ability to create, incur or assume liens, make certain loans and investments, incur or assume certain additional debt, make fundamental changes and change the nature of the Company's business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries. In addition, the Credit Agreement will require the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, in each case, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default (subject to customary grace periods, cure rights and materiality thresholds), including, among others, failure to pay principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross-defaults and cross-acceleration to material indebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain material judgments, certain ERISA events, change of control and invalidity of loan documents. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, under the Credit Agreement, the lenders, by a majority vote, will have the ability to direct the administrative agent to (or that the administrative agent with the consent of the majority lenders may) terminate the commitments, accelerate all loans made under the Credit Agreement and exercise any of the lenders' other rights under the Credit Agreement and the related loan documents on their behalf.
No borrowings of loans under the Credit Agreement were made on the Closing Date.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference.
In addition to the specific agreements and arrangements described above, affiliates of some of the Underwriters and parties to the Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates have provided and may in the future provide certain financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services in the ordinary course of business for the Company, its subsidiaries and certain of their respective affiliates, for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses in connection with the performance of such services.
 
On the Closing Date, the ABL Facility was repaid in full with a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes and terminated, as described in Item 1.01 above. The information set forth in Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02, insofar as it relates to the termination of the ABL Facility.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation.
 
Share Repurchase Program
On January 11, 2011, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized a new share repurchase program that gives the Company the ability to repurchase up to $500 million of shares of its common stock over a three-year period (the "Repurchase Program"). Stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program may be made from time to time, as the Company deems appropriate, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions. The Company may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the Repurchase Program at any time without prior notice. There can be no assurance as to the number of shares the Company will purchase, if any, under the Repurchase Program.
Press Release for Offering and Credit Agreement
On January 11, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the Notes. On January 14, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing the successful completion of its debt refinancing, including the closing of the Notes offering and the entering into of the Credit Agreement.

provided
however
(c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against one or more of the indemnifying parties under such subsection, notify each indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , , that the failure to so notify each such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies each indemnifying party thereof, each such indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with each other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from each indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, each such indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation, except that (A) the Underwriters will have the right to employ a single counsel (plus a single local counsel in each different jurisdiction) to represent jointly the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company and any Guarantor or Guarantors, as the case may be, under Section 7(a) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company and any Guarantor or Guarantors, as the case may be, in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and any Guarantor or Guarantors, as the case may be, and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company or any Guarantor or Guarantors, as the case may be, has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company and such Guarantor or Guarantors, as the case may be, and (B) if the Company or any Guarantor is the indemnified party, the Company and any Guarantor will have the right to employ a single counsel (plus a single local counsel in each different jurisdiction) to represent jointly the Company or any Guarantor who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Company or any Guarantor against the Underwriters under Section 7(b) if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the
provided
however
 
Underwriters, in writing, (ii) the Company or any Guarantor will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Company or any such Guarantor which are different from or additional to those available to the Underwriters, and in the judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Company or any such Guarantor to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Underwriters have failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel satisfactory to the Company and any such Guarantor, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Underwriters. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (A) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with the consent of each indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, each such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, each of the Guarantors
 
and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 7(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 7(c) above).
(e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 7, to the respective officers, directors and affiliates of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company and each of the Guarantors (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company and each of the Guarantors who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
8. . If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in
Substitution of Underwriters
 
Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or any Guarantor, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and each of the Guarantors and the Underwriters contained in Section 7 of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 8.
If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order that the Company and the Guarantors may effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and each of the Company and the Guarantors agrees to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of the Representatives, may thereby be made necessary.
Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.
9. . Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company and the Guarantors if (i) any of the events described in Sections 6(l) and 6(m) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (ii) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Notes at an office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 4.08 hereof for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount. The Company shall not charge a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with the transfer or exchange of the Notes from the Holder requesting such transfer or exchange (other than any exchange of a temporary Note for a permanent Note not involving any change in ownership or any exchange pursuant to Section 2.12, 3.06 or 9.05 hereof, not involving any transfer).
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions (other than the provisions set forth in the fourth paragraph) of this Section 2.08, a Global Note representing all or a portion of the Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of such Depositary. Any holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall, by acceptance of such beneficial interest, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Note may be effected only through a book-entry system maintained by (a) the Holder of such Global Note (or its agent) or (b) any holder of a beneficial interest in such Global Note, and that ownership of a beneficial interest in such Global Note shall be required to be reflected in a book-entry.
Each Global Note is exchangeable for Notes in certificated form only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary for the Global Notes or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor depositary within 90 days of that notice or becoming aware that the Depositary is no longer so registered, (ii) an event of default has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of certificated Notes or (iii) the Company determines (subject to DTC's procedures) not to have the notes represented by a Global Note. In any such event the Company will issue, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of certificated Notes, will authenticate and deliver, Notes in certificated form in exchange for such Global Note. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in either Global Note will be entitled to physical delivery in certificated form of Notes equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name. Notes so issued in certificated form will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for Notes in certificated form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. All cancelled Global Notes held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by the Trustee and a certificate of their destruction delivered to the Company. Notes in certificated form issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Notes as instructed in writing by the Depositary.
At the option of the Holders of certificated Notes, certificated Notes may be exchanged for other certificated Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the certificated Notes to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any certificated Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the certificated Notes which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during a period beginning 15 Business Days before any selection of Notes to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.
SECTION 2.09. . If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company or the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Company shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Note (including, with limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements in replacing such Note). In the event any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company may pay such Note instead of issuing a new Note in replacement thereof.
Replacement Notes
 
Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 2.09 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.
SECTION 2.10. . The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section as not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.11 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Note. Subject to the foregoing, in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Notes have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, (including, without limitation, determinations pursuant to Articles 6 and 9 hereof), only Notes outstanding at the time of such determination shall be considered in any such determination.
Outstanding Notes
If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a Redemption Date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue interest.
SECTION 2.11. . For purposes of determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have taken any action under this Indenture, Notes owned by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Subject to the foregoing, only Notes outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination.
When Notes Disregarded
SECTION 2.12. . Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.
Temporary Notes
Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture as permanent Notes.
SECTION 2.13. . The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy canceled Notes according to its normal operating procedures (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act). The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation
 
SECTION 2.14. . Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in whose name that Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Payment of Interest
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes which is payable (""), it shall pay the Defaulted Interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the Defaulted Interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent Special Record Date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on the Notes and the date of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such Special Record Date and payment date, provided that no such Special Record Date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such Defaulted Interest. At least 15 days before the Special Record Date, the Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states the Special Record Date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.
Defaulted Interest
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14 and Section 2.08 hereof, each Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note.
SECTION 2.15. . Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name such Note is registered as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (and subject to Sections 2.08 and 2.14 hereof) interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Persons Deemed Owners
None of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the Depositary's records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Note in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the Depositary's records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
SECTION 2.16. . Interest on the Initial Notes will accrue from January 14, 2011. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Computation of Interest
SECTION 2.17. . The Company, in issuing the Notes, may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will as promptly as practicable notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
SECTION 2.18. .
Issuance of Additional Notes
The Company shall be entitled, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Notes to increase the principal amount of Notes under this Indenture and issue such increased principal amount (or any portion thereof), in which case any Additional Notes so issued will have the same form and terms (other than the Issue Date, offering price and, under certain circumstances, CUSIP/ISIN number and date from which interest thereon will begin to accrue), and will carry the same right to receive accrued and unpaid interest, as the Initial Notes, and such Additional Notes will form a single class with the Initial Notes, including for voting purposes.
 
With respect to any Additional Notes, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers' Certificate, a copy of each of which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information:
 
 
SECTION 3.01. . If the Company elects to redeem prior to the Stated Maturity thereof all or part of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Notes, it shall notify the Trustee of the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, the Redemption Date and the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest, if any, to but not including the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price. The Company shall give such notice to the Trustee at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Trustee).
Notices to Trustee
SECTION 3.02. . If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed or purchased in an offer to purchase at any time, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed or purchased on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
Selection of Notes to be Redeemed
No Notes of $2,000 of principal amount or less will be redeemed in part. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption. The Trustee shall make the selection at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date from outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount of that Note to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note presented for redemption will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due on the date fixed for redemption at the applicable Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in paying the applicable Redemption Price, interest ceases to accrue or accrete on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.
SECTION 3.03. . At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address.
Notice of Redemption
The notice shall identify the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the Redemption Price, including interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for redemption;
(3) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the Redemption Date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note;
(4) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(5) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;
(6) that, unless the Company defaults in paying such Redemption Price, interest on Notes (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date;
 
(7) the paragraph of the Notes and/or provision of this Indenture or any supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed;
(8) the CUSIP number and ISIN, if any, printed on the Notes being redeemed; and
(9) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number or ISIN, if any, contained in such notice or printed on the Notes and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
At the Company's written request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at its expense; that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Trustee), an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as required by this Section 3.03.
provided, however,
SECTION 3.04. . Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date. A notice of redemption may not be conditional.
Effect of Notice of Redemption
Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
SECTION 3.05. . On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued interest on, all Notes to be redeemed on that date, other than Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption that have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall as promptly as practicable return to the Company any money deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued interest on, all Notes to be redeemed. If such money is then held by the Company in trust and is not required for such purpose it shall be discharged from such trust. In addition, if any money deposited with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent, or held by the Company, in respect of any redemption of Notes remains unclaimed for two years after the applicable Redemption Date, such money shall be handled in accordance with Section 8.06.
Deposit of Redemption Price
If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the Redemption Date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of the Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the related Interest Payment Date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the Redemption Date until such principal is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes.
SECTION 3.06. . Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's written request, the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Company's expense) a new Note equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.
Notes Redeemed in Part
SECTION 3.07. . Prior to October 14, 2020, the Notes will be redeemable, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at the Company's option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice at a Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date, equal to the greater of:

SECTION 3.09. . (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 3.07, the Company will make an offer (a "") to each Holder to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of each Holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to but not including the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant Regular Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date (the "").

The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, this Indenture does not contain provisions that permit Holders of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.09, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 3.09 and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer; or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable Redemption Price.

SEC Reports
provided, however
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
SECTION 4.03. .

Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions
Sale and Leaseback Transaction
(a) within 12 months after the receipt of the proceeds of the sale or transfer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company applies an amount equal to the greater of the net proceeds of the sale or transfer or the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors) of such property or assets at the time of such sale or transfer to the prepayment or retirement (other than any mandatory prepayment or retirement) of Senior Funded Debt; or

Maintenance of Office or Agency
The Company also may from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes.

With respect to any Global Note, the Corporate Trust Office for the Trustee shall be the place of payment where such Global Note may be presented or surrendered for payment or for registration of transfer or exchange, or where successor Notes may be delivered in exchange therefore; provided, however, that any such payment, presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the procedures of the Depositary for such Global Note shall be deemed to have been effected at the place of payment for such Global Note in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Custodian
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
SECTION 6.02. . (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes at the time outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company in writing (and to the Trustee, if given by Holders of the Notes) specifying the Event of Default, may declare the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of acceleration on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such amounts shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor occurs, the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of such Event of Default on all the Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
Acceleration
ipso facto
(b) At any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable (or shall have become immediately due and payable), and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
 
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, and waive such Event of Default, if any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such Notes, other than the nonpayment of principal, premium, or interest on Notes that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.04. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the event of a declaration of acceleration in respect of the Notes because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4) shall have occurred and be continuing (excluding any resulting payment default under this Indenture or the Notes), such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically annulled if (i) the default under the debt that is the subject of such Event of Default has been cured by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantor or has been waived by the holders thereof or (ii) the holders of the debt that is the subject of such Event of Default have rescinded their declaration of acceleration in respect of such debt, and written notice of such cure, waiver or rescission shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company and countersigned by the holders of such debt or a trustee, fiduciary or agent for such holders, within 20 days after such declaration of acceleration in respect of the Notes and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no other Event of Default exists or has occurred during such 20-day period which has not been cured or waived during such period.
SECTION 6.03. . If an Event of Default with respect to any Notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
Other Remedies
The Trustee may institute and maintain a suit or legal proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default with respect to any Notes shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 6.04. . The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes by written notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except a continuing Default in the payment of the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on a Note. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 6.02 hereof and this Section 6.04, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration.
Waiver of Past Defaults
SECTION 6.05. . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of the Notes or that would subject the Trustee to personal liability; that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
Control by Majority
provided, however,
SECTION 6.06. . Except to enforce the right to receive payment of the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on a Note when due, as provided in Section 6.07, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes unless:

(v) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.
It is understood and intended and expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Note, with every other taker and holder with the Trustee that a Holder of Notes may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of the Notes or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders).
SECTION 6.07. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes held by such Holder, on or after their respective Maturity, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after their respective Maturity, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
SECTION 6.08. . If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.
Collection Suit by Trustee
SECTION 6.09. . The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.

SECTION 6.12. . Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor (to the extent the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor may lawfully do so) shall at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim to take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Covenant Defeasance

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Guarantees, the Company and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Notes shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof with respect to the Notes, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Section 6.01(3) hereof (solely with respect to the covenants described in Sections 3.09, 4.02, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 5.01 and 5.02) and Sections 6.01(4) and 6.01(6) with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors and Section 6.01(7) shall not constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
Covenant Defeasance
SECTION 8.04. . The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof to the outstanding Notes:
Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(3) in the case of the legal defeasance option, 91 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 91-day period no Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) with respect to the Company or any other Person making such deposit occurs that is continuing at the end of the period;

(7) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;
 
(8) in the case of the Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and
(9) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as applicable, of the Notes as contemplated by this Article Eight have been complied with.

Anything in this Article Eight to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or noncallable U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(2) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
SECTION 8.06. . Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 8.07. . If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any Dollars or noncallable U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.08 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.08 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.08 hereof, as the case may be; that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of the Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
Reinstatement
provided, however,
 
SECTION 8.08. . If at any time: (a) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes theretofore authenticated (other than any Notes that shall have been destroyed, lost or stolen and that shall have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.07 and Notes for whose payment money and/or U.S. Government Obligations have theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereupon repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 8.06); or (b) all such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have become due and payable, or are by their terms to become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption, and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in United States Dollars, noncallable U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay at maturity or upon redemption all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be, and if the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder with respect to such Notes by the Company, and shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Notes have been complied with, then this Indenture shall thereupon cease to be of further effect with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees except for:
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
(a) in the case of clause (b) above, the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes under Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08 and 2.09;
(b) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith (including, but not limited to, the rights of the Trustee and the duties of the Company under Section 7.07, which shall survive despite the satisfaction in full of all obligations hereunder); and
(c) Sections 8.05, 8.06, 8.07 and 8.08,
each of which shall survive until the Notes have been paid in full (thereafter, the Company's obligations in Section 7.07 only shall survive).
Upon the Company's exercise of this Section 8.08, the Trustee, on demand of the Company and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture with respect to the Notes.
SECTION 9.01. . The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes without the consent of any Holder:

(e) to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor by this Indenture, to add to the covenants of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the protection of the Holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors of the Company shall consider to be for the protection of the Holders of the Notes, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in respect of any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions a Default or an Event of Default under this Indenture; that with respect to any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision, such amendment may provide for a period of grace after default, which may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other Defaults, may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such Default, may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such Default or may limit the right of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes to waive such default;
provided, however,
(f) to cure any ambiguity or omission or correct or supplement any provision contained in this Indenture, in any supplemental indenture or in any Notes that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained therein;
(g) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property to or with the Trustee, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture as shall not materially adversely affect the interests of any Holders of the Notes;

(i) to make any change not otherwise specified in this Section 9.01 that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;
(j) to add to, change, or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture with respect to the Notes, so long as any such addition, change or elimination not otherwise permitted under this Indenture shall (A) neither apply to the Notes created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor modify the rights of the Holders of any such Notes with respect to the benefit of such provision or (B) become effective only when there is no such Notes outstanding;
(k) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor or separate Trustee with respect to the Notes and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of this Indenture by more than one Trustee; or

SECTION 9.02. .

However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment may not:
With Consent of Holders
(1) reduce the percentage of principal amount of the Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver;
 
(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on the Notes;

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to all affected Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all such Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section.
SECTION 9.03. . Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
SECTION 9.04. . A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Note shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Note or portion of the Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Note or portion of the Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder. An amendment or waiver becomes effective once both (i) the requisite number of consents have been received by the Company or the Trustee and (ii) such amendment or waiver has been executed by the Company and the Trustee.
Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
SECTION 9.05. . If an amendment changes the terms of the Notes, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Note regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
SECTION 9.06. . The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article Nine if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities
Trustee to Sign Amendments
 
of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and (subject to Section 7.02) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
SECTION 9.07. . Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders, ratably, that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Payment for Consent
SECTION 10.01. . Subject to the provisions of this Article Ten, each Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the Notes hereby jointly and severally unconditionally guarantees, on a senior unsecured basis, to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors, irrespective of (i) the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantors to the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder or (ii) the absence of any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or default of a Subsidiary Guarantor, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, interest and defaulted interest with respect to the Notes shall be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest or defaulted interest with respect to the Notes and all other obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder and all other obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Notes shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and thereof and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders of the Notes, for whatever reason, each Subsidiary Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Notes shall constitute an event of default under this Subsidiary Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee to accelerate the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company.
Guarantee
Each Subsidiary Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture, waives the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that such Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in this Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantee. This Subsidiary Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or to any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder of the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article Ten, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six of this Indenture for the purposes of the Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Six of this Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
The Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes are pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Notes, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Notes shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
No shareholder, partner, manager, member, director, officer, employee, agent or incorporator, past, present or future, of any Subsidiary Guarantor, as such, shall have any personal liability under this Subsidiary Guarantee by reason of his, her or its status as such partner, manager, member shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent or incorporator.
SECTION 10.02. . The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount as shall, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Indenture, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Subsidiary Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on the net assets of each Subsidiary Guarantor, determined in accordance with GAAP.
Limitation of Subsidiary Guarantee
SECTION 10.03. . Each Subsidiary Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture, waives to the extent permitted by law any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Holder of the Notes against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Subsidiary Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Notes shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Holders of the Notes, and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such Holders to be credited and applied upon the Notes, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Subsidiary Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture, shall acknowledge that it shall receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 10.03 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
Waiver of Subrogation
SECTION 10.04. . Any Subsidiary Guarantee executed pursuant to Section 4.09 of this Indenture (including, without limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantee of the Notes issued as of the Issue Date), shall be automatically and unconditionally released upon the release of the guarantee or the obligation that resulted in Section 4.09 of this Indenture becoming applicable (other than by reason of payment under such guarantee) without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes upon such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to guarantee or be an obligor with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility or a guarantor or obligor under any other Credit Facility Debt or Capital Markets Debt of the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors. In addition, any Subsidiary Guarantee of this Indenture shall be automatically and unconditionally released upon: (i) upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company); or (ii) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the property of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than to any Affiliate of the Company other than another Subsidiary Guarantor); , that, in each case, after giving effect to such transaction, such Subsidiary is no longer liable for any guarantee or other obligations in respect
Release of Subsidiary Guarantee
provided, however
 
of any Credit Facility Debt or Capital Markets Debt of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any Subsidiary Guarantee also will be released if the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance or its Covenant Defeasance option as set forth in Article Eight, or if the Company's obligations under this Indenture are discharged as set forth in Section 8.08. The Company will give written notice as promptly as practicable to the Trustee of the automatic release of any Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to this Section 10.04. At the Company's request, the Trustee will execute and deliver any documents, instructions or instruments evidencing any such release.
SECTION 11.01. . If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control. Each Subsidiary Guarantor in addition to performing its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall perform such other obligations as may be imposed on it with respect to this Indenture under the TIA.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
Acts of Holders
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to such officer the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than such signer's individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of such signer's authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
(c) The ownership of bearer securities may be proved by the production of such bearer securities or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary, wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the bearer securities therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or affidavit of the Person holding such bearer securities, if such certificate or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory.

The ownership of bearer securities may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
 
(d) The ownership of registered securities shall be proved by the register maintained by the Registrar.
(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of a Note shall bind every future Holder of the same Note and the holder of every Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such a Note.
(f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of outstanding Notes have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the outstanding Notes shall be computed as of such record date; that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Date of authentication:
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Company, designated as its 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (herein called the "Notes," which expression includes any additional notes issued pursuant to Section 2.18 of the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), issued and to be issued under an indenture, dated as of January 14, 2011 (herein called the "Indenture"), among O'REILLY AUTOMOTIVE, INC., a Missouri corporation (such company, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS listed on the signature pages to the Indenture and UMB Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto relevant to the Notes reference is hereby made for a complete description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Note shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to create or incur Liens or engage in Sale and Leaseback Transactions, in each case, subject to some exceptions as set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture also imposes certain limitations on the ability of the Company to merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into any other person or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the property of the Company in any one transaction or series of related transactions, in each case, subject to some exceptions as set forth in the Indenture.
Each Note is subject to, and qualified by, all such terms as set forth in the Indenture certain of which are summarized herein and each Holder of a Note is referred to the corresponding provisions of the Indenture for a complete statement of such terms. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the summary provisions set forth in the Notes and the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern.
 
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on January 14 and July 14 of each year, commencing July 14, 2011. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from [date of original issue]. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
 
Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent, registrar and service agent. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, registrar or co-registrar and service agent without notice. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, registrar, co-registrar or service agent.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, subject to certain limitations, may declare all the Notes due and payable immediately. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) and premium, if any, of all outstanding Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act by the Trustee or any Holder of outstanding Notes.
Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives reasonable indemnification. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power under the Indenture.
 
At any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable (or have become immediately due and payable), and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if any and all existing Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, other than the nonpayment of principal, premium, or interest on Notes that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.04 of the Indenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except a Default in the payment of the principal amount of premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on a Note. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
 
In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by the Indenture, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into supplemental indentures (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect), without the consent of any Holder of Notes, for one or more of the following purposes: (i) to evidence the succession of another person to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the Company's or such Subsidiary Guarantor's covenants, agreements and obligations; (ii) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture; (iii) to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor by the Indenture, to add to the covenants of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the protection of the Holders of all or any Notes as the Board of Directors of the Company shall consider to be for the protection of the Holders of such Notes, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in respect of any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture; , that with respect to any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision, such amendment may provide for a period of grace after default, which may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other Defaults, may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such Default, may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such Default or may limit the right of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes to waive such default; (iv) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture, in any supplemental indenture or in any Notes or to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of the "Description of the Notes" contained in the Prospectus relating to the offer and sale of the Notes to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture; (v) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property to or with the Trustee, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under the Indenture as shall not adversely affect the interests of any Holders of Notes; (vi) to modify or amend the Indenture in such a manner as to comply with the requirements of the SEC in connection with the qualification and maintenance of qualification of the Indenture or any supplemental indenture thereto under the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect and to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary; (vii) to add or to change any of the provisions of the Indenture to provide that Notes in bearer form may be registrable as to principal, to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal or premium with respect to Notes in registered form or of principal, premium or interest with respect to Notes in bearer form, or to permit Notes in registered form to be exchanged for Notes in bearer form, so as to not adversely affect the interests of the Holders or any coupons in any material respect or permit or facilitate the issuance of Notes in uncertificated form; (viii) to add guarantees or security to the Notes; (ix) to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of Subsidiary Guarantors or any security interest in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture; (x) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect; (xi) to add to, change, or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, so long as any such addition, change or elimination not otherwise permitted under the Indenture shall (A) neither apply to any Note created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor modify the rights of the Holders of any such Note with respect to the benefit of such
provided
however,
 
provision or (B) become effective only when there is no such Note outstanding; and (xii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor or separate Trustee with respect to the Notes and to add to or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Indenture by more than one Trustee.
With the written consent (as evidenced as provided in Section 9.02 of the Indenture) of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding affected by such amendment (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), the Company the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, may amend the Indenture without notice to any Holder; that no such amendment shall, without the consent of the Holders of each Note then outstanding and affected thereby, (i) reduce the percentage of principal amount of Notes the Holders of which must consent to an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver; (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time of payment of interest on any Note; (iii) reduce the principal amount or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note; (iv) reduce the Redemption Price of any Note or add redemption provisions to any Note; (v) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Indenture or the Note or, other than in accordance with the provisions of Article Ten of the Indenture, eliminate any existing Subsidiary Guarantee of the Notes; (vi) impair the right to receive, and to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment with respect to the Notes; (vii) after the time a Change of Control Offer is required to have been made, adversely affect the right of repayment or repurchase at the option of a Holder; or (viii) reduce the principal amount of notes that is required to consent to an amendment or waiver. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
provided
Any consent to an amendment or a waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes that may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes. Any Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke its consent if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders, ratably, that so consent, waive or agree to amend.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
 
Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 3.07 of the Indenture, any Holder of Notes shall have the right to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture)) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture.
 
The Notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund.
 
 
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. When Notes are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without payment of any service charge but with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration or exchange of Notes.
The Company and the Registrar shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing or (b) to register the transfer or exchange of Notes selected, called or being called for redemption as a whole or the portion being redeemed of any such Notes selected, called or being called for redemption in part.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes and in accordance with the Indenture, create and issue Additional Notes (as defined in the Indenture) having the same terms and conditions as the Initial Notes (as defined in the Indenture) in all respects (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest) so as to form a single series with the Initial Notes.

The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the register maintained by the Registrar.
 
No shareholder, partner, manager, member, director, officer, employee, agent or incorporator, as such, of any Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or a Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder shall waive and release all such liability. This waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.
 
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company at any time may terminate some or all of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money and/or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust. Thereafter the Holder of such Note shall look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; ,
provided
 
that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors to the extent set forth in the Indenture.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Paying Agent may do the same with like rights.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
 
For value received                      hereby sell(s), assign(s) and transfer(s) unto                      (please insert social security or other identifying number of assignee) the within Note, and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints                      attorney to transfer the said Note on the books of the Company, with full power of substitution in the premises.

In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company and the Guarantors, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have also assumed that the Company and the Non-Delaware Guarantors have complied and will comply with all aspects of the laws of all relevant jurisdictions (including the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Indenture and the Registration Statement.

(b) the execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantors of, and the performance of their respective obligations under, the Securities and the Indenture will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective properties is subject; (ii) any law, rule or regulation to which the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective properties is subject; (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority; or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority;

(d) we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on each of the Securities or any transactions contemplated thereby;
(e) we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); and

Our opinions set forth herein are limited to (i) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, (ii) the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and (iii) those laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such law (other than Opined on Law) on the opinions herein stated. Insofar as the opinions expressed herein relate to matters governed by laws other than Opined on Law, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect the opinions set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable laws.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. When duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
2. The Guarantees of the Delaware Guarantors have been duly authorized and executed by the Delaware Guarantors and when the Notes are issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Guarantees will constitute valid and binding obligations of each of the Guarantors, enforceable against each of the Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, being filed on the date hereof, and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement.

Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation

(iii) Each Lender and each L/C Issuer shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

DOJ Investigation
The Department of Justice ("")'s criminal investigation into the legacy pre-acquisition accounting practices of CSK (the "") is near a conclusion and is described more fully below. In addition, the SEC complaint against three (3) former employees of CSK for alleged conduct related to CSK's historical accounting practices remains ongoing. The action filed by the SEC on July 22, 2009, against Maynard L. Jenkins, the former chief executive officer of CSK seeking reimbursement from Mr. Jenkins of certain bonuses and stock sale profits pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 also continues. The DOJ criminal complaint against Don Watson, the former Chief Financial Officer of CSK, remains ongoing with trial set to commence on or about June 7, 2011.
DOJ
DOJ Investigation
With respect to the ongoing DOJ Investigation, attorneys from the DOJ indicated that, as a result of conduct alleged against the former employees, as set forth in the pleadings in United States vs. Fraser, et. al., U.S. District Court, District of Arizona; Case No: 2:09-cr-00372-SRB, the DOJ believes criminal charges against CSK are appropriate. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have continued to cooperate with and engage in discussions with the DOJ to resolve the pre-acquisition accounting issues related to CSK arising from the conduct of its former employees as referenced above. The Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries and the DOJ have now agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ Investigation. Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, the Company recorded an additional charge of $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2010 to increase its accrual in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million dollars.
Notwithstanding the agreement in principle with the DOJ, several of CSK's former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed or deposed as part of criminal, administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits. As described above, certain former employees of CSK are the subject of civil and criminal litigation commenced by the government. Under Delaware law, the charter documents of the CSK entities and certain indemnification agreements, CSK has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are currently incurring legal fees on behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. Some of these indemnification obligations and other related costs may not be covered by CSK's insurance policies.
As a result of the CSK acquisition, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries expect to continue to incur ongoing legal fees related to the indemnity obligations related to the litigation that has commenced by the DOJ and SEC of CSK's former employees.

, January 14, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)  O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ("O'Reilly" or "the Company") (Nasdaq: ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, announced today that it successfully completed the debt refinancing transactions undertaken as part of the Company's financing plan announced on Tuesday, January 11, 2011. The refinancing provides the Company with enhanced flexibility and increased liquidity, extends the Company's debt maturities and improves the Company's overall capital structure.
SPRINGFIELD, Mo.
"We are pleased to announce the successful closing of our note offering and the replacement of our existing revolving credit facility," Greg Henslee, Co-President and Chief Executive Officer of O'Reilly stated. "We are very excited that the debut of our public debt offering was well-received and featured investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are the result of the success of our business, which has been achieved by the hard work and dedication of our over 45,000 Team Members."
The following are key highlights of the Company's new debt structure:
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Henslee added, "The debt transactions were inaugural steps toward implementing a long-term capital structure targeting a rent-adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of 2.0x to 2.25x, using a six-times capitalized rent. As previously announced, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to utilize the program, as part of our capital structure plan, to prudently repurchase shares when free cash is available and market conditions are optimal. Our ongoing focus remains on profitable growth and industry consolidation and the new facility provides us with the tools we need to help us achieve these goals."
