"O'Reilly finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter as we, again, delivered record breaking revenues and earnings," said Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President. "We achieved comparable store sales growth of 9.2% for the fourth quarter which drove an increase of 33% in adjusted earnings per share, resulting in our eighth consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth. In November, we converted our acquired Phoenix distribution center to the O'Reilly systems and simultaneously converted the final 151 CSK stores to our point-of-sale system. With these conversions, all acquired CSK stores now have same-day or overnight access to O'Reilly's broad range of hard parts product offerings, marking a significant milestone in the CSK integration process. Through the consistent execution of our proven dual market strategy and with the support of our robust distribution network, we continue to profitably grow market share in all the markets we serve."

O'Reilly and the DOJ have agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve the DOJ investigation of CSK's legacy accounting practices. Based upon the agreement in principle for a final settlement, the Company recorded a charge of $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in anticipation of the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement and the Company paying a one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million to the DOJ.

The table below outlines the impact of the CSK DOJ investigation charge and the gain on the settlement of the note receivable for the year ended December 31, 2010, (amounts in thousands, except per share data): 
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, stated, "During 2010, we opened 156 new stores, closed 7 stores and opened a record four new DCs, increasing our store count to 3,570 and our DC count to 23. We also converted 884 acquired CSK stores to the O'Reilly systems and converted one CSK DC to the O'Reilly systems. During the first half of 2011, we will finish the rebranding and signage changeovers of all the acquired CSK stores, including front-room remodels, decor package installations and outside sign replacements. We also plan to open 170 new stores in 2011. Our continued growth and success is the direct result of our Team's relentless dedication to providing excellent customer service to all of our retail and professional service providers. Due to the hard work of our Team Members, 2010 has been a very successful year for Team O'Reilly, and we are excited to continue to grow our business in 2011."
Mr. Henslee added, "As we look ahead to 2011, our focus will continue to be on profitable growth and margin improvements by providing unsurpassed levels of customer service. With the completion of the system conversions in the acquired CSK stores, we are well positioned to aggressively expand our market share during the coming years. I would like to thank all 47,000 of our hard working and dedicated Team Members for the fantastic results they achieved in 2010; we look forward to building upon those results in 2011."
