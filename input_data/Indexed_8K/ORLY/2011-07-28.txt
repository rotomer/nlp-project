As previously announced, the Company's results for the three months ended June 30, 2010, included a charge related to the legacy United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") investigation of CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") into CSK's pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. A one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million will be paid to the DOJ upon completion of an agreement among the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly. In anticipation of execution of the agreement, the Company accrued $15.0 million during the second quarter of 2010 and an additional $5.9 million during the third quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, increased 13%, to $222 million (or 15.0% of sales) from $196 million (or 14.2% of sales), which was adjusted for the impact of the $15 million charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, during the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, increased 19%, to $0.96 from $0.81, which was adjusted for the impact of the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above, during the second quarter of 2010. The table below outlines the impact of the legacy CSK DOJ investigation charge for the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 (amounts in thousands, except per share data):
"We are pleased to report another quarter of solid results and double-digit earnings growth. Our second quarter results are highlighted by a 19% increase in diluted earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, and a record high operating margin of 15.0%," Greg Henslee, O'Reilly's CEO and Co-President stated. "We attribute this outstanding operating margin performance to our relentless focus on expense control, which resulted in a 95 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales. Our stores continue to generate solid sales performance, driven by excellent customer service. I would like to congratulate Team O'Reilly for the outstanding results we've accomplished since our acquisition of CSK three years ago  none of which would have been possible without our Team's commitment to our Company and our customers."
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President, commenting on the Company's second quarter, stated, "During the quarter, we opened 44 new stores, which brings our total to 99 new store openings for the first half of 2011, keeping us on track to reach our goal of 170 net, new store openings in 2011. Our strong performance is reflective of the hard work and dedication of our 49,000 Team Members.  I would like to thank each of them for all of their contributions to our Company's success."

During the first half of 2011, we continued to enhance shareholder value by opportunistically executing our share repurchase program and buying back 5.9 million of our shares.

3 Quarter and Updated Full-Year 2011 Guidance
rd
The table below outlines the Company's guidance for selected third quarter and updated full-year 2011 financial data:
Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock option compensation and rent ("EBITDAR"). The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying reconciliation table.
