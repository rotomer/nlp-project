Gross profit for the third quarter increased to $754 million (or 49.1% of sales) from $693 million (or 48.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the third quarter increased to $513 million (or 33.4% of sales) from $488 million (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%. Operating income for the third quarter increased to $241 million (or 15.7% of sales) from $199 million (or 14.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 21%.

Diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter increased 34% to $1.10 on 135 million shares versus $0.82 for the same period one year ago on 142 million shares.
As previously announced, the Company's results for the three months ended September 30, 2010, included a charge related to the legacy United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") investigation of CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") into CSK's pre-acquisition historical accounting practices. The Company accrued $15.0 million during the second quarter of 2010 and an additional $5.9 million during the third quarter of 2010 in anticipation of executing a Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") among the DOJ, CSK and O'Reilly and paying a one-time monetary penalty of $20.9 million. During the third quarter of 2011, the NPA was executed and the previously recorded, one-time $20.9 million penalty was paid to the DOJ on behalf of CSK.
Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, in the paragraph below were adjusted for the impact of the $5.9 million charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation discussed above. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011, increased 18%, to $241 million (or 15.7% of sales) from $205 million (or 14.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago.

Commenting on the Company's quarterly results, Greg Henslee, Co-President and CEO stated, "We are pleased to report another successful quarter. Our results are highlighted by a solid 4.8% comparable store sales increase on top of an extremely strong comparable store sales increase of 11.1% last year, a 50 basis point improvement in gross margin and a record-breaking 15.7% operating margin. The continued trend of solid comparable store sales increases is the direct result of the hard work and commitment to unsurpassed customer service from each of our dedicated Team Members. Our relentless focus on expense control, at all levels, led to the 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. I am very pleased with the performance of Team O'Reilly and would like to thank all of our Team Members for their commitment to exceeding customer expectations."
"During the third quarter, we continued to invest in profitable growth with the opening of 50 new stores which raised our total store count to 3,707 stores in 39 states," stated Ted Wise, Co-President and COO. "Throughout the year, we opened stores in many of our existing markets, as well as several new markets, further leveraging the capacity of our comprehensive network of 23 regional distribution centers. Our nearly 50,000 Team Members remain dedicated to developing strong and lasting relationships with both our retail and professional service provider customers and to establishing the O'Reilly Brand as a symbol of the best value, customer service and parts availability in the industry."

Mr. Henslee added, "We continue to work hard to improve our free cash flow with a particular focus on improving the productivity of our net inventory investment. As of the end of the quarter, we have improved our inventory turnover, net of accounts payable, by 20% driven by improved vendor terms and a $14 million reduction of inventory since the beginning of 2011, while still opening 137 new stores. This strong improvement in net inventory investment, combined with our strong operating results, generated free cash flow of $597 million for the first nine months of 2011, an increase of $281 million over 2010. During the third quarter, we also issued $300 million of senior notes as we continue to work to balance our capital structure. Our strong free cash flow performance and our efforts to balance our capital structure have enabled us to repurchase 14.4 million shares of our stock for a total investment of $859 million, at an average price of $59.81 per share, since the inception of our $1 billion board authorized share repurchase program."

On January 11, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, and on August 5, 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $1 billion.

4 Quarter and Updated Full-Year 2011 Guidance
th
The table below outlines the Company's guidance for selected fourth quarter and updated full-year 2011 financial data:
Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock option compensation and rent ("EBITDAR"). The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, a non-recurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying reconciliation table.
