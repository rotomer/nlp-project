The Company's results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission and a former CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") officer that resulted in the reimbursement to CSK of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This "clawback" amount was included in "Operating income" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011. As previously announced, the Company's results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, included a nonrecurring, non-operating gain of $12 million ($7 million, net of tax) related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK.

"We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial results," stated Greg Henslee, CEO and Co-President of the Company. "As a result of our continued efforts to profitably grow sales, along with our culture of strict expense control, we generated a fourth quarter increase in comparable store sales of 3.3% while also increasing our adjusted operating margin to 14.7%, a 214 basis-point improvement over the fourth quarter last year. For the year, we generated a comparable store sales increase of 4.6%, and we expect to continue these strong results in 2012 with comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 6%. For the full year, we generated a record 14.9% adjusted operating margin, and we expect to achieve an operating margin of 15% in 2012, a year earlier than our 2013 goal. Our continued success is the direct result of our Team Members' commitment to providing the highest level of service to our customers every day. I want to thank Team O'Reilly for your dedication and hard work and congratulate you on another great year."

The charge related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation was included in "Operating income" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Commenting on O'Reilly's full-year results, Mr. Henslee added, "We are very proud of the success we achieved in decreasing our net inventory investment by over $420 million for the year. This working capital improvement, along with lower capital expenditures during the year, generated $791 million in free cash flow. During the year, we generated significant shareholder value through our share buyback program by repurchasing over 15 million of our shares for a total investment of almost $1 billion, and we expect to continue to prudently execute our buyback program during 2012. I would like to again thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued contribution to our Company's successes, and we look forward to the opportunities 2012 will bring."
Ted Wise, COO and Co-President stated, "During 2011, we expanded into our 39 state, completed the acquired CSK store interior resets to the O'Reilly format, converted the CSK exterior signs to the O'Reilly Brand and opened 170 net, new stores, which increased our store count to 3,740. Our outlook for 2012 includes the continued expansion of our store base with the opening of 180 new stores along with the relocation or renovation of nearly 50 existing stores. We continue to open stores in both existing and new markets and have maintained our focus on rapidly growing professional service provider business in the western states. Our Team Members' commitment to superior service levels was the foundation for our 4.6% comparable store sales increase during 2011, which was on top of an extremely strong comparable store sales increase of 8.8% last year, and we look to continue this solid growth in 2012."

1 Quarter and Full-Year 2012 Guidance
st
The table below outlines the Company's guidance for selected first quarter and full-year 2012 financial data:
Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock option compensation and rent ("EBITDAR"). The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the former CSK officer clawback, the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying reconciliation table.
