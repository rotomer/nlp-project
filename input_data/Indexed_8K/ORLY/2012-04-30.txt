Net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, increased $45 million, or 44%, to $147 million (or 9.6% of sales) from $102 million (or 7.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the first quarter increased 58% to $1.14 on 129 million shares versus $0.72 for the same period one year ago on 143 million shares.
As previously announced, the Company's results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, included one-time charges associated with the financing transactions the Company completed in January of 2011.

The charges related to the Company's financing transactions were included in "Other income (expense)" on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items for the first quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, and are reconciled in the table accompanying this release.

Commenting on the Company's quarterly results, CEO and Co-President, Greg Henslee, stated, "We are pleased to report a very strong start to 2012, highlighted by our comparable store sales increase, excluding the extra Leap Day, of 6.1% and a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin to 16.2%, representing a record high. The improvement in operating margin was driven by a combination of solid gross margin performance and strong SG&A expense leverage. Our 37% increase in adjusted earnings per share is once again the direct result of the hard work of our over 51,000 dedicated team members. We want to thank each of you for your commitment to our ongoing success and we look forward to growing the O'Reilly brand in all of our markets during the remainder of 2012."

st
Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members. Comparable store sales increased 7.4% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, versus 5.7% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. Comparable store sales, adjusted for the impact of one additional day during the first quarter ended March 31, 2012, as a result of Leap Day, increased 6.1% versus 5.7% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
"Our strong performance in the first quarter is the direct result of the superior service our store team members provide to both our retail and professional installer customers every day," stated Ted Wise, COO and Co-President. "A key driver of the success of our stores is the behind-the-scenes work at our distribution centers to ensure O'Reilly has industry-leading parts availability, and we would like to thank our store and DC teams for their hard work and dedication. Our stores in historic markets continue to provide exceptional customer service and perform at very high levels, and our proven dual-market strategy has gained significant traction in our western markets as our management teams concentrate on growing market share in those markets. Our national advertising campaigns have allowed us to aggressively promote the O'Reilly brand across the country and we are very pleased with the opportunities that we see for continued expansion across our existing geographic footprint as well as in new expansion markets."
2 Quarter and Updated Full-Year 2012 Guidance
nd
The table below outlines the Company's guidance for selected second quarter and updated full-year 2012 financial data:
Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These items include adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent ("EBITDAR"). The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the former CSK officer clawback, the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of CSK, the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the tables accompanying this release.
