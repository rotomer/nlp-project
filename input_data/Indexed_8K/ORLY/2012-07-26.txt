We have repurchased $8
61
million of our stock this year and, since the inception of the program last year, we have repurchased over $1.8 billion of our stock." 
 
Mr. Henslee continued, We believe the key drivers for demand in our industry remain intact, however, more importantly, we remain dedicated to executing our proven dual market strategy and providing the highest level of customer service in the industry.  Our unwavering commitment to both our do-it-yourself and professional service provider customers, supported by our robust distribution infrastructure, unsurpassed parts availability and highly trained and knowledgeable parts professionals, is the key to our continued future, profitable growth.

We remain focused on growing our retail market share and thus far this year

we have relocated 17 stores and renovated 34 stores to improve both our retail image and ensure the best customer experience possible.

Quarter and Updated Full-Year 2012 Guidance
The table below outlines the Companys guidance for selected
third
quarter and updated full-year 2012 financial data:
 
 
Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  These items include adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent (EBITDAR).  The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.  The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the former CSK
Auto Corporation (CSK)
officer clawback, the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable ac
quired in the acquisition of CSK
, the charges related to the legacy CSK DOJ investigation, as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Companys core operations.  The Company excludes these items in judging its performance and believes this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well.  The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure in the tables accompanying this release.
