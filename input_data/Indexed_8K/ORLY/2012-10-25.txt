Mr. Henslee stated, We continue to see improved participation from our vendors in our financing programs, resulting in the increase in our accounts-payable-to-inventory ratio to 84.4%. 
With s
trong operating results, along with the improvements in our working capital,
we
have generated $816 million in free cash for the first nine months of 2012, representing a 37% improvement over the same period last year.  We have used this free cash to directly return value to our shareholders by repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares year to date.
 
Mr. Henslee continued, Our year-to-date comparable store sales increased 3.7%, on top of a 4.9% increase in the prior year
,
and we have seen an improvement in our comparable store sales trends during the first several weeks of October over the results we saw in the third quarter,
reinforcing
our confidence in the long term outlook for
our
industry.  While we remain cautious about these improving trends, we expect our fourth quarter comparable store sales to increase in the
range of two to four percent.
 
During the third quarter, we opened 3
7
net, new stores covering 20 states.  Our year-to-date store expansion of 156 net, new stores brings our total store count to 3,896, which is only 24 stores shy of our 2012 full-year guidance, commented Ted Wise, OReillys COO and Co-President.  We plan to open 190 net, new stores in 2013surpassing the 4,000 store mark during the year.  In order to support our growth in the southeast, we are pleased to announce plans
for
our 24th distribution center in Lakeland, Florida
, which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2014
.  This additional distribution center will support our existing store base in Florida and will allow us to expand throughout the entire state.  I would like to thank each of our nearly 53,000 Team Members for their dedication to the OReilly Team, your hard work is the reason for our past success and will be the catalyst for the continued profitable growth of OReilly Auto Parts.

Non-GAAP Information
This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  These items include adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, free cash flow, and rent-adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent (EBITDAR).  The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.  The Company believes that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the former CSK

officer clawback, the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements, the nonrecurring, non-operating gain related to the settlement of a note receivable ac
quired in the acquisition of CSK
,
as well as the presentation of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR and free cash flow, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Companys core operations.
