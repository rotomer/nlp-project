Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure - ------ ----------------------------------------- On August 22, 2002, Occidental completed the sale of the entities that own its 29.5-percent interest in Equistar Chemicals, LP ("Equistar") to Lyondell Chemical Company ("Lyondell") and its purchase of 34 million shares of Lyondell's newly issued Series B common stock, $1.00 par value per share, which constitute approximately 21 percent of Lyondell's common stock. These transactions are expected to reduce the volatility of Occidental's earnings in the future and provide Occidental an exit from the bulk petrochemicals business (see the description below of the restrictions on transferability of the Series B common stock). Following the closing of these transactions, Occidental's indemnity in favor of Equistar, which related to approximately $420 million of Equistar's debt, terminated. Bondholders of Equistar and other third party creditors were not direct beneficiaries of Occidental's indemnity. Occidental will account for its Lyondell holdings as an equity investment. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Occidental recorded an after-tax charge of $240 million to write down its investment in the Equistar partnership. This reduced the after-tax carrying value of the investment to approximately $375 million, representing the approximate fair value of Lyondell's Series B Common Stock to Occidental had these transactions closed at that time. In the first quarter of 2002, Equistar wrote off goodwill on its balance sheet, resulting in a charge to its earnings of $1.1 billion. This write-down by Equistar did not affect Occidental's investment in Equistar because there was no significant difference between Occidental's book basis in the Equistar investment and the underlying equity in net assets of Equistar subsequent to Occidental's write-down discussed above. Occidental will have an after-tax gain of at least $100 million in the third quarter of 2002 as a result of closing these transactions. The gain results from: Occidental's share of Equistar losses in 2002, which reduced the carrying value of the investment prior to the closing of these transactions; an increase in the fair value of Lyondell's Series B Common Stock received in exchange for the partnership interests since December 31, 2001; and additional tax benefits accruing to Occidental due to a change in the tax regulations relating to the disposition of members of tax consolidations announced by the Internal Revenue Service in March 2002 and effective for transactions closing after March 7, 2002. To effect these transactions, Occidental has entered into several agreements with Lyondell, including: o a Securities Purchase Agreement, effective July 8, 2002; o a Stockholders Agreement, effective August 22, 2002; o a Warrant, effective August 22, 2002; o a Registration Rights Agreement, effective August 22, 2002; and o an Occidental Partner Sub Purchase Agreement, effective July 8, 2002. These agreements are briefly described below. The descriptions below do not attempt to completely describe these agreements. Please refer to the copies of these agreements enclosed as exhibits to this report. 1
SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT ----------------------------- o Occidental paid Lyondell $440 million for 34 million shares of Series B common stock, a warrant (described below), and a right to receive from Lyondell 7.38 percent of any distributions (excluding distributions from asset or equity sales) that Lyondell receives from Equistar before May 1, 2004. o Lyondell Series B common stock is basically identical to Lyondell regular common stock except that Lyondell may elect to pay dividends on the Series B common stock "in-kind," meaning in shares of Series B common stock, rather than in cash. STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT ---------------------- o The agreement will be effective as long as Occidental owns 17 million or more shares of Lyondell common stock. o Occidental may not sell its Series B common stock or Warrant without Lyondell's consent. o Occidental may convert its Series B common stock into Lyondell regular common stock only after 3 years, or after 2 years if Lyondell's credit agreements do not prohibit Lyondell from paying dividends on the shares Occidental proposes to convert, as is currently the case. Occidental may convert and sell its Series B common stock at any time with Lyondell's consent. o Occidental generally must vote its shares in favor of the slate of directors proposed by Lyondell's management. o Two of Occidental's executive officers have been elected to Lyondell's board of directors. o Occidental may not engage in certain activities to attempt to control Lyondell's management. WARRANT ------- o Occidental may purchase up to 5 million shares of Lyondell's regular common stock for $25 per share, subject to adjustment if Lyondell's regular common stock is trading below $11 per share during the 15 business days before December 31, 2002. This Warrant expires on the close of business on August 22, 2007. o Lyondell may elect to pay Occidental, in cash or regular or Series B common stock, the difference between (x) the value of the Lyondell shares Occidental elects to purchase under this Warrant and (y) the purchase price for those shares. REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT ----------------------------- o Occidental has specific rights requiring Lyondell to register Lyondell regular common stock that Occidental owns. Occidental has a number of demand and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain restrictions. 2
OCCIDENTAL PARTNER SUB PURCHASE AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------- o Occidental sold its three indirect subsidiaries that own a total of 29.5 percent of Equistar for $440.01 million in cash.

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Subject Securities will be subject to the Stockholder Agreement and, among other things, will bear the legends specified therein. The Purchaser is acquiring the Subject Securities for investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of applicable law, and has not offered or sold any portion of the Subject Securities to be acquired by it. The Purchaser acknowledges and understands that investment in the Subject Securities is subject to a high degree of risk and that it must bear the economic risk of its investment for an indefinite period of time because the Subject Securities must be held -8-
indefinitely (i) until subsequently registered under the Securities Act and applicable state and other securities laws or (ii) unless an exemption from registration is available which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the Purchaser's investment intent and the accuracy of the Purchaser's representations as expressed herein. The Purchaser understands that any transfer agent of the Company will be issued stop transfer instructions with respect to the Subject Securities unless such transfer is subsequently registered under the Securities Act and applicable state and other securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available.

The Purchaser has had a reasonable opportunity to ask questions relating to and otherwise discuss the terms and conditions of the offering and the other information set forth in the Company SEC Reports and this Agreement and the Company's business, management and financial affairs with the Company's management and other parties, and the Purchaser has received satisfactory responses to its inquiries. To the extent necessary, the Purchaser has retained, at the expense of the Purchaser, and relied upon appropriate professional advice regarding the investment, tax and legal merits and consequences of this Agreement and its purchase of the Subject Securities hereunder. The Purchaser has relied only on its own independent investigation and on the Company's representations and warranties in this Agreement and the Related Securities Agreements before deciding to acquire the Subject Securities. 4.8 Sophistication and Financial Condition of Stockholder. The Purchaser is an experienced and sophisticated investor and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters or its professional advisors have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as are necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Subject Securities and to evaluate the merits and risks of its investment and protect its own interest in connection with the acquisition of a Subject Security. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of this investment regarding the Company, is able to hold the Subject Securities indefinitely and has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the Company in the event such loss should occur. 4.9 Status of the Company Securities. The Purchaser has been informed by the Company that the Subject Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws, including Section 25102(f) of the California Corporations Code, except as specifically provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, and are being offered and sold in reliance upon federal and state exemptions for transactions not involving any public offering. The Purchaser acknowledges that any certificate representing Subject Securities will bear the legend or legends specified by Section 4.5 of the Stockholder Agreement. 4.10 No Ownership of the Company Securities.

If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, the Indemnified Party may initiate a judicial proceeding in accordance with the conditions set forth in Sections 9.10, 9.13 and 9.14. 8.6 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any Party shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim pursuant to Section 8.5 to the Party to be providing the indemnification (which notice shall identify the representation or warranty claimed to have been inaccurate, or -19-

If there is a Corporate Change, the Company or its successor following such Corporate Change shall make appropriate adjustments to the provisions of this Warrant (including those relating to adjusting the Exercise Price, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercising this Warrant and the Company's Net Payment Right) so that this Warrant will apply, as nearly as possible, to any shares or other property deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant as if the Holder had exercised this Warrant immediately before such Corporate Change and the Holder had carried out the terms of the exchange such Corporate Change provided for effective as of the consummation of such Corporate Change. The Company shall not effect any Corporate Change unless, upon or before it is consummated, the Company's successor following such Corporate Change has assumed in writing (x) the obligation to deliver to the Holder the shares of stock or other securities, cash or property that the Holder has the right to purchase in accordance with this Section 4(d) and (y) the Company's other obligations under this Warrant.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT This REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 22, 2002, is entered into by Occidental Chemical Holding Corporation, a California corporation ("OCHC"), and Lyondell Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The definitions of capitalized terms used in this Agreement are set forth in Appendix A. WHEREAS, the Company and OCHC entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated July 8, 2002 (the "Securities Purchase Agreement"), governing the sale by the Company of shares of Series B Common Stock on the Closing Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), certain additional shares of Series B Common Stock that may be issuable in the future upon and subject to the terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase Agreement, and warrants for the purchase of 5,000,000 shares of Original Common Stock (the "Warrant"), as adjusted pursuant to the terms thereof, to OCHC; WHEREAS, the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement provide for the execution and delivery of this Agreement; and WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Occidental"), and OCHC are entering into a Stockholders Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement"); NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants of the Parties set forth herein, it is hereby agreed as follows: SECTION 1 DEMAND REGISTRATION ------------------- 1.1 Registration Rights. Subject to Sections 1.2 and 1.3, if one or more Rightsholders provide the Company at any time a written request that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of Registrable Securities owned by such Rightsholder (that request being referred to as an "Initial Demand Request" and such registration being referred to as a "Demand Registration"), the Company shall: (a) within 10 days after receiving the Initial Demand Request, notify all other Rightsholders of such request (the "Company Notice"); (b) from the date the Company delivers the Company Notice, give all other Rightsholders 15 days to notify the Company of the number of Registrable Securities such other Rightsholders desire the Company to include in the registration statement relating to such Demand Registration; and
(c) within 45 days after receiving the Initial Demand Request, file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering all Registrable Securities that the Rightsholders requested to be registered and, after such filing, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective. The Initial Demand Request shall specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold and the manner of distribution. 1.2 Underwriting Requirements. If an Initial Demand Request provides for the sale of Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering and an OCHC Party is participating in the related registration, then OCHC shall have the right to select the lead managing underwriter for such underwriting in its sole discretion and to select the other underwriters for such underwriting, subject to the consent of the Company which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In such event, the participating OCHC Party shall specify the proposed underwriters in the Initial Demand Request or the notice delivered pursuant to Section 1.1(b). If the Initial Demand Request or the notice delivered pursuant to Section 1.1(b) provides for the sale of Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering and no OCHC Party is participating, the Company shall have the right to select all underwriters. In the case of an underwritten offering, any Rightsholder or other holder of Securities that has the right to include Securities in that Demand Registration and elects to do so shall participate, and include those Securities, in the underwriting as provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 1, if the lead managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that the total amount of Securities proposed to be included in the offering, including by the Company and the Rightsholders, exceeds the amount of Securities that is compatible with the offering's success, then the Company shall: (a) so advise all Rightsholders and other holders of Securities that would otherwise have Securities registered under such registration statement; (b) to the extent necessary, entirely exclude from such registration statement all Securities (including Securities the Company owns or proposes to issue) other than Rightsholders' Registrable Securities and Securities subject to pari passu registration rights; and (c) to the extent necessary after effecting such exclusion, allocate the number of Securities the registration will cover on a pro-rata basis among the Rightsholders and all other holders of Securities subject to pari passu registration rights according to the total number of Securities each of them owns subject to registration rights to reduce the total amount of Securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by the lead managing underwriter. To facilitate allocating shares in accordance with this Section 1.2(c), the Company may round the number of shares allocated to any Rightsholder to the nearest 100 shares. 1.3 Limitations. (a) The Company will not be obligated to initiate any Demand Registration at any time if (i) doing so would breach any provision of any applicable Rightsholders' -2-
agreement entered into pursuant to Section 4.4 or (ii) the Company determines in good faith that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration would materially impede, delay or interfere with any firm-commitment underwritten offering of Securities by the Company (including an offering involving sales of Securities to initial purchasers who intend to resell the Securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, Regulation S or to accredited investors (as defined in the Securities Act)) on which the Company has commenced work prior to receiving an Initial Demand Request, in which event the Company will have the right to defer the filing of such Demand Registration until such offering is completed or such time as the Company is no longer proceeding diligently to effect such offering (but in no event more than 45 days (excluding the time needed to respond to SEC comments, conduct a roadshow, price and close such offering (provided such closing is within a reasonable period of time after the roadshow)); provided, however, that the Company may not use the right set forth in this clause (ii) more than once in any 12-month period. (b) The Company will only be obligated to initiate a Demand Registration if the amount of Registrable Securities proposed to be registered pursuant to Section 1.1 in the aggregate (i) exceeds 8,000,000 shares of Original Common Stock in the case of a Traditional Underwriting or 3,000,000 shares of Original Common Stock in the case of any Demand Registration that is not a Traditional Underwriting and (ii) in the case of a Traditional Underwriting, has a good faith estimated public offering price (as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Company) of at least $100 million ((i) and (ii) together, to the extent applicable, the "Minimum Amount"). (c) The Company will not be required to effect more than three Demand Registrations in any 12-month period, only one of which may be a Traditional Underwriting. A Demand Registration will be deemed effected upon the initial filing of the registration statement related thereto unless (i) the Rightsholder elects to terminate it following the Company's exercise of any deferral right pursuant to Sections 1.3(a)(ii) or 1.3(d) or (ii) the Company fails to comply with its obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Demand Registration and a Rightsholder reasonably determines, and notifies the Company, that such failure has a material adverse effect on such Rightsholder. (d) If the Company determines in good faith that the registration and distribution of Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration would (i) materially impede, delay or interfere with any acquisition, corporate reorganization or other significant transaction involving the Company or (ii) require disclosure of material non-public information, the disclosure of which at that time would materially and adversely affect the Company, the Company shall have the right to defer the filing or effectiveness of the registration statement relating to such Demand Registration for a period of not more than 30 days after receipt of the Initial Demand Request; provided, however, that the Company may not use this right more than once in any 12-month period. (e) The Company shall give notice to the Rightsholders (i) at the beginning of any deferral period under this Section 1.3 promptly following its receipt of the Initial Demand Notice and (ii) promptly following the end of any such deferral period. -3-
SECTION 2 COMPANY "PIGGYBACK" REGISTRATION -------------------------------- 2.1 Registration Rights. If the Company proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration to be effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Rightsholders) any shares of Original Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with the underwritten public offering of such Securities solely for cash (other than a registration on Form S-4 or such other forms as are then prescribed under the Securities Act for the same purposes as such form, a registration relating solely to the sale of Securities to participants in a Company compensation, benefit or stock plan or a registration in which the only Original Common Stock being registered is Original Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt or equity Securities that are also being registered), the Company shall, at that time, promptly give each Rightsholder written notice of such registration. Upon the written request of each Rightsholder (to the extent the Company receives such request within 15 days after the Company delivered its notice of registration under this Section 2), the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, cause to be registered under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Rightsholder has requested to be registered. 2.2 Underwriting Requirements. If the lead managing underwriter for an offering advises the Company that the total amount of Securities proposed to be included in such offering, including by the Company and the Rightsholders, exceeds the amount of Securities that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion is compatible with such offering's success, then the Company shall have the right to reduce the number of Securities, including Registrable Securities, included in the offering to a number that the lead managing underwriter determines in its sole discretion is so compatible. In the event that a reduction occurs, the amount of Original Common Stock to be included in the offering will be allocated first, to the Company; second, to the Rightsholders and all other holders of Securities subject to pari passu registration rights by reducing the number of Securities each may sell on a pro-rata basis, based upon the number of shares of Original Common Stock that each of such Rightsholders and other holders own at such time subject to registration rights; and third to any other holders of Securities. 2.3 Rightsholder Right to Withdraw. Each Rightsholder has the right to withdraw all or any portion of its Registrable Securities from a registration under Section 2 at any time before the effective date of the applicable registration statement. 2.4 Company Right to Withdraw. The Company has the right to withdraw any registration statement and abandon any proposed offering, subject to Section 2, without the consent of any Rightsholder, notwithstanding the request of any such Rightsholder to participate therein in accordance with Section 2, if the Company determines to do so in its sole discretion. -4-
SECTION 3 ADDITIONAL COMPANY OBLIGATIONS ------------------------------ 3.1 Whenever required under this Agreement to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as is commercially reasonably possible (or within any more-specific time period this Agreement requires): (a) at least five Business Days before filing a registration statement, prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, furnish to the Rightsholders who are participating in such registration statement, the underwriters, and a single counsel to all Rightsholders requesting to include shares of Registrable Securities in such registration statement (which counsel will be selected by the Rightsholder requesting the largest number of shares of Registrable Securities to be included in such registration statement and be reasonably satisfactory to the Company), copies of the registration statement, prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto proposed to be filed. These documents will be subject to the review of such Rightsholders, underwriters and counsel, and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take into account, and, if appropriate, reflect such comments as such Rightsholders, underwriters and counsel reasonably may propose; (b) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to those Registrable Securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and keep such registration statement effective for a period of at least 45 days (or such shorter period during which the distribution contemplated in the registration statement is completed); (c) prepare and file with the SEC any amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Securities such registration statement covers and make generally available an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act (except that the Company will be deemed to have complied with this clause if it has complied with Rule 158 under the Securities Act); (d) notify the Rightsholders participating in such registration statement promptly and (if requested) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when any registration statement, prospectus, prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment relating to such registration has been filed, and, with respect to such registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any SEC request for amendments or supplements to such registration statement or the related prospectus or for additional information regarding Rightsholders, -5-
(iii) of the SEC's issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for such purpose, (iv) of the Company's receipt of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of any determination by the Company that any event has occurred that requires making any changes in such registration statement, prospectus, or documents incorporated (or deemed to be incorporated) by reference in any of such documents so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact that they are required to state or that is necessary to make the statements in such documents not misleading and (vi) of any determination by the Company that any event has occurred that would cause such registration statement or the prospectus contained therein not to be usable for resale of the Registrable Securities; (e) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction in the United States; (f) furnish to each Rightsholder participating in such registration statement, the designated counsel for those Rightsholders, and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of such registration statement, as declared effective by the SEC, and of each post-effective amendment to such registration statement, in each case including financial statements and schedules, and deliver, without charge, the number of copies of the preliminary prospectus, any amended preliminary prospectus, each final prospectus and any post-effective amendment or supplement to any of such documents, as each Rightsholder may reasonably request in order to facilitate its disposition of the Registrable Securities included in such registration statement in conformity with the Securities Act's requirements; (g) use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the Securities such registration statement covers under all securities laws or Blue Sky laws of United States and Canadian jurisdictions that the Rightsholders reasonably request; provided that the Company will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject; (h) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3.1(d)(v) or 3.1(d)(vi), prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such registration statement or the related prospectus or any document incorporated (or deemed to be -6-
incorporated) by reference in such documents and file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold under such documents, such documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in such documents or necessary to make the statements in such documents, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, any applicable securities exchange and the requirements of the Securities Act; (j) on or before the registration statement's effective date, provide the Company's transfer agent for the Registrable Securities with printed certificates for the Registrable Securities that such registration statement covers in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company; (k) cause all Registrable Securities registered under this Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange that similar Securities are then listed on; (l) if an offering is an underwritten offering, make available for inspection by any Rightsholder participating in such registration statement, any underwriter participating in any offering pursuant to such registration statement, the designated counsel for the Rightsholders, any counsel to the underwriters, and any accountant or other agent retained by any of those Rightsholders or underwriters (collectively, the "Inspectors"), financial and other records and information, pertinent corporate documents and properties of any of the Company and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Records"), as are reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibilities; provided, however, that if the Company determines in good faith that certain Records are confidential and so notifies the Inspectors in writing, the Company need not disclose such confidential Records to any Inspector unless the Inspector signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which agreement shall permit the release of such confidential Records if disclosing such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such registration statement or so ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction; and (m) if an offering is an underwritten offering, enter into any agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings, including customary lock-up provisions) and take all other customary, appropriate and reasonable actions (including in the case of a Traditional Underwriting, assisting with the roadshow) that the managing underwriters or Rightsholders holding a majority of Registrable Securities included in the offering request in connection with such agreements in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities included in the offering, and in that connection, (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain opinions (in form, scope and substance reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriters' counsel) of the Company's counsel and updates of such opinions, -7-
addressed to each of the underwriters, as to the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and any other matters those counsel and underwriters reasonably request, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain "cold-comfort" letters and updates of such letters from the Company's independent certified public accountants (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any Company Affiliate or of any business the Company owns for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the registration statement), addressed to each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold-comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings and (iii) if requested and if an underwriting agreement is entered into, provide indemnification provisions and procedures substantially to the effect included in Section 6 with respect to all Persons to be indemnified pursuant to such Section. The Company shall perform its obligations under this Section 3.1(m) at each closing under the applicable underwriting or similar agreement, or as and to the extent such agreements require. SECTION 4 ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF RIGHTSHOLDERS --------------------------------------- 4.1 General. The Company's obligation to take any action pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Rightsholder is conditioned on such Rightsholder (i) furnishing the Company information regarding itself, its Registrable Securities, and its intended method of disposing of those Registrable Securities as the Company reasonably requests in writing to allow the Company to effect the registration of such Rightsholders' Registrable Securities and (ii) taking all such action as may be reasonably required in order not to delay the registration and offering of the Securities by the Company. 4.2 Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Rightsholder may participate in any underwritten registered offering contemplated hereunder unless such Rightsholder (i) agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements, which shall be of a customary nature, and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements and this Agreement. 4.3 Discontinuation of Sales Upon Certain Events. Upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(v) or 3.1(d)(vi), each Rightsholder will forthwith discontinue the offer and sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until receipt by such Rightsholder and the underwriters of copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(h), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and, if so -9-
directed by the Company, each Rightsholder will, and will request the underwriters to, deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in its or their possession of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. 4.4 Holdback. Each Rightsholder agrees not to effect any sale (including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act) of any Securities, before or after the effective date of a registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC for an underwritten offering of equity Securities (except for Registrable Securities that are included in such registration statement pursuant to this Agreement) but only if and to the extent the managing underwriter for such offering requests. However, any limits on Rightsholders' sales (i) shall not be greater in any way than the limits on the Company's directors, executive officers and any other significant stockholders who have purchased securities of the Company directly from the Company and (ii) shall expire within 90 days after the offering's effective date. Each Rightsholder shall execute and deliver to the managing underwriter any letter or agreement, which shall be in substantially the same form as to be delivered by the Company's directors, executive officers and any applicable significant stockholders of the Company, that the underwriter may reasonably request to the foregoing effect. Promptly upon any Rightsholders' request, the Company shall request a waiver of the Rightsholders' agreement pursuant to this Section 4.4. SECTION 5 EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION ------------------------ 5.1 The Company shall bear all costs, fees and expenses (excluding underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses of separate counsel for the Rightsholders, fees and expenses of any other expert or advisor retained by or at the request of a Rightsholder, any underwriter or any underwriter's counsel and out-of-pocket expenses associated with any roadshow) incident to its performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including all registration, filing and qualification fees (including qualification with state blue sky laws, the New York Stock Exchange or any other exchange the Company's Securities are then listed on), printers' fees and fees and expenses of the Company's accountants (including the costs of any "cold-comfort" letters) and fees and expenses of the Company's counsel. SECTION 6 INDEMNIFICATION ---------------- 6.1 Company's Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Rightsholder, each underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for the Rightsholders, each Person, if any, who controls each Rightsholder or each underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, and each of their respective constituent partners, members, employees, agents, contractors, officers and directors against any losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties, assessments by public agencies, settlement, costs and expenses (including costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and other liabilities (any of the foregoing being a "Loss") that relate in any way to any Violation. The Company shall pay to each Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.1 the amount of Losses they incur as they incur such Losses. However, the Company will not need to pay any indemnified Person the amount of (i) Losses that are settlement payments if such indemnified Person makes the settlement without the Company's consent (so long as the Company did not unreasonably -9-
withhold its consent), or (ii) Losses to the extent such Losses arise out of a Violation that occurs because the Company relied on written information about the indemnified Person that the indemnified Person furnished to the Company expressly for the Company to use in connection with the applicable registration or (iii) Losses, in the case of any Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Shares or any other Person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, or any constituent partner, member, employee, agent, contractor, officer or director of any such underwriter, in any such case to the extent such Losses arise out of such underwriter's failure to send or give a copy of the final prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to the Person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Shares to such Person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus. 6.2 Rightsholders' Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each selling Rightsholder (severally but not jointly) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), each other Rightsholder participating in a registration statement, each Person, if any, who controls the Company, underwriter, or other participating Rightsholder within the meaning of the Securities Act and each of their respective constituent partners, members, employees, agents, contractors, officers and directors against any Losses to the extent such Losses arise out of a Violation that occurs because the Company relied on written information about the indemnifying Rightsholder that the indemnifying Rightsholder furnished to the Company expressly for the Company to use in connection with the applicable registration. Each indemnifying Rightsholder shall pay each Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.2 the amount of Losses they incur as they incur a Loss. However, the indemnifying Rightsholder will not need to pay (i) any indemnified Person the amount of Losses that are settlement payments if such indemnified Person makes the settlement without the indemnifying Rightsholders' consent (so long as the indemnifying Rightsholder did not unreasonably withhold its consent) and (ii) any amount of Losses under this Section 6.2, Section 6.4, or under such sections together, that exceeds the net proceeds such indemnifying Rightsholder received from the offering that the Violation arises out of. 6.3 Additional Procedures. Promptly after a Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6 receives notice that it might be subject to Losses, such indemnified Person shall notify the indemnifying Person in writing regarding such potential Losses. The indemnifying Person will have the right to participate in, and, jointly with any other indemnifying Person, to assume the defense against such Losses with one counsel selected by the indemnifying Person, subject to the consent of the indemnified Person (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). If a conflict of interest exists or develops that would prohibit one counsel from representing both the indemnifying Person and the indemnified Person, then the indemnified Person (together with all other indemnified Persons that one counsel can represent without a conflict of interest) will have the right to retain one separate counsel of their own choosing, with the indemnifying Person paying all the fees and expenses. Except in the event of a conflict of interest, if the indemnifying Person notifies the indemnified Person that it has elected, and then promptly begins, to defend the indemnified Person against Losses, the indemnifying Person will not be liable to such indemnified Person for any legal expenses such indemnified Person subsequently incurs in connection with such defense. If the indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense against any Losses, the indemnifying Person shall allow the indemnified Person to continue to -10-
participate in defending against such Losses (at the expense of the indemnified Person) if the indemnified Person so chooses. The indemnified Person's failure to notify the indemnifying Person within a reasonable time regarding Losses will not relieve the indemnifying Person of any liability to the indemnified Person under this Section 6 except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying Person's ability to defend against such Losses. In defending against Losses, an indemnifying Person shall not consent to entry of any judgment regarding, or otherwise settle, any claim involving Losses unless (x) the indemnified Person has approved in writing the judgment or other settlement or (y) the judgment or other settlement includes the claimant's unconditional release of the indemnified Person from all liability related to that claim. 6.4 Unavailability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the indemnification under this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified Person with respect to any Losses, then the indemnifying Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to the amount the indemnified Person must pay in connection with such Losses the appropriate proportion to reflect the indemnifying Person's relative fault in connection with such Losses. The indemnifying and indemnified Persons shall determine the indemnifying Person's and indemnified Person's relative fault based on, among other things, which Person supplied information relating to the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact and the Person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 6.5 Conflict With Underwriting Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6, to the extent (but only to the extent) that the underwriting agreement's provisions on indemnification and contribution conflict with the provisions of Section 6, the underwriting agreement's provisions will control. 6.6 Survival. The Company's and Rightsholders' obligations under Section 6 will survive (i) the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement under this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement's termination. SECTION 7 RULE 144 -------- 7.1 The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Rightsholder, make publicly available other non-confidential information so long as necessary to permit sales under Rule 144 under the Securities Act), and it will take such other action as any Rightsholder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Rightsholder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of any Rightsholder, the Company will deliver to such Rightsholder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. -11-
SECTION 8 ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS --------------------------------- 8.1 A Rightsholder may assign its rights under this Agreement only in connection with a Permitted Transfer pursuant to which the assignee executes a written agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company whereby the assignee agrees to assume all of the obligations of such Rightsholder hereunder and to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement. A Rightsholder's assignment of any rights under this Section 8 will pertain only to the Registrable Securities and Derivative Securities that such Rightsholder transfers so that such Rightsholder will retain any rights it held prior to such transfer under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities and Derivative Securities that such Rightsholder continues to own. SECTION 9 TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS ---------------------------------- 9.1 The right of any specific Rightsholder to request registration or to include Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to this Agreement will terminate when such Rightsholder ceases to hold Registrable Securities or Derivative Securities convertible or exercisable for Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the termination as to any specific Rightsholder, this Agreement shall remain in effect for all other Rightsholders holding Registrable Securities or Derivative Securities convertible or exercisable for Registrable Securities. SECTION 10 LIMITATIONS ON SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATION RIGHTS --------------------------------------------- 10.1 From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Rightsholders holding at least a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding (but giving effect, for the purposes of such calculation and consent, to the issuance of Registrable Securities pursuant to the exercise or conversion of then exercisable or convertible Derivative Securities), enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any Securities granting registration rights with respect to such Securities that would be superior to those granted under this Agreement. SECTION 11 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- 11.1 Successors and Assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.1, no Rightsholder may otherwise assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent and any purported assignment by a Rightsholder that does not comply with the terms of Section 8.1 shall be void and ineffective. Except as may be expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors of each of the Parties. -12-
11.2 Benefits of Agreement Restricted to Parties. This Agreement is made solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no other Person (including each Party's employees or stockholders) shall have any right, claim or cause of action under or by virtue of this Agreement. 11.3 Notices.

No Occidental Partner Sub has received from any foreign, federal, state or local taxing Authority (including jurisdictions where any Occidental Partner Sub has not filed Tax Returns) any notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing Authority against any Occidental Partner Sub (other than Tax attributable to its interest in the Partnership).

(f) Each Occidental Partner Sub has amended or will amend its federal income Tax Returns corresponding exactly to the information provided to such Occidental Partner Sub by the Partnership. 7
(g) Other than because of such items being reported by the Partnership, Oxy LP2 will not be required to include any item of income in taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; or (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date. (h) Each Affiliated Group of which any Occidental Partner Sub is or was a member (each an "Occidental Affiliated Group") has filed all income Tax Returns that it was required to file for each taxable period during which any Occidental Partner Sub was a member of such group. Any tax shown as due on such returns as owing has been paid. With respect to the items on such Occidental Affiliated Group Tax Returns specifically concerning any Occidental Partner Sub, other than items for which such Tax Returns are filed or amended in accordance with information provided by the Partnership, there is no dispute or claim either (i) claimed or raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which any Occidental Party or its Affiliate has Knowledge based upon personal contact with any agent of such authority.

(b) If at any time prior to a Lease Termination Event the Purchaser believes in good faith it would be in the best interests of the Partnership, then OCC may make the Plant Transfer to the Partnership if OCC's board of directors, in its sole discretion, elects to do so. In such event, the Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to cause the Partnership to accept the Plant Transfer that are within its control and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the Partnership and any other partners of the Partnership all such actions by them as are necessary for the Partnership to accept the Plant Transfer. (c) (i) If there is a Lease Termination Event and (A) OCC or one of its Affiliates owns the Lake Charles Facility and (B) no Person other than OCC, its Affiliates, the Partnership or the Purchaser is entitled to use and operate the Lake Charles Facility, then the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree, and to cause the Partnership to consent, to an arrangement that provides for the use and operation of the Lake Charles Facility by the Purchaser or its designee on terms reasonably acceptable to OCC and the Purchaser or its designee (which may include formation of the LC Partnership (as defined in the Partnership Agreement)).

If the Purchaser does not make such request, OCC or one of its Affiliates may operate the Lake Charles Facility for its own or its Affiliates' benefit and account. (d) At the Closing, the Parties shall execute and deliver the Plant Put Option Agreement.

(f) The provisions of Sections 6.9(b), 6.9(c), 6.9(d), 6.9(e) and 6.9(h) shall be the Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy for any loss of Units it or its Affiliates might incur as a result of the operation of Section 14 of the Partnership Agreement or as a result of the loss of the use and operation of the Lake Charles Facility; provided, however, that the exclusivity of these provisions with regard to first party claims of the Purchaser shall not in any manner preempt or limit any rights that the Purchaser and its Affiliates may have with respect to Third Party Claims (as defined in the Parent Agreement) under Section 3.4 of the Parent Agreement or Third Party Claims under any analogous provisions contained in this Agreement. (g) Each of the Purchaser and the Occidental Parties shall mitigate, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates to mitigate, any damages resulting from a loss of Units as a result of the operation of Section 14 of the Partnership Agreement or from the loss of the use and operation of the Lake Charles Facility, by taking all actions which a reasonable person would undertake to minimize or alleviate the amount of such losses and the consequences thereof, as if such Person would be required to suffer the entire amount of such losses and the consequences thereof by itself, without recourse or any remedy against another Person, including pursuant to the right of the Purchaser to receive the Make Whole Amount hereunder. (h) If there is a No Rebuilding Termination and as a result thereof the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates suffers a loss of Units pursuant to Section 14.3 of the Partnership Agreement, then, provided that the Partnership has complied with its obligation to deliver the related Proceeds to OCC under Section 12 or 13 of the LC Lease, as applicable, the Occidental Parties shall pay the Purchaser the Make Whole Amount. 15

SECTION 7 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN TAX MATTERS --------------------------------------------------- 7.1 Absence of Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Parties and Occidental agree that, with respect to the purchase of the Oxy LP2 Shares and the Oxy GP Shares, the Parties and Occidental shall not make an election or cause or permit any of its Affiliates or its or their successors to make an election with respect to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any comparable provision of applicable law. 7.2 Absence of Tax Election As to Oxy LP1. The Occidental Parties shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of their Affiliates to, make any affirmative election for Oxy LP1 with respect to the conversion of Oxy LP1 to a Delaware limited liability company to be treated as an association subject to taxation as a corporation for purposes of the Code. 7.3 Tax Indemnification. Each Occidental Party shall jointly and severally indemnify each Occidental Partner Sub, the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Affiliates and hold them harmless from and against without duplication, any Loss attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of any Occidental Partner Sub for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member (other than on Occidental Partner Sub) of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Occidental Partner Sub (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than an Occidental Partner Sub) imposed on any Occidental Partner Sub as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing and (iv) arising by reason of any breach by an Occidental Party of the representations contained in Section 4.7. 7.4 Tax Indemnification Duration. The obligations of the Occidental Parties pursuant to Section 7.3 are unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect until audit, assessment and collection of any such Taxes are barred by the applicable statute of limitations plus sixty days. 7.5 Straddle Periods. Occidental shall include the taxable income or loss of Oxy LP1, Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP (including any deferred income triggered into income under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-1) on Occidental's consolidated federal income Tax 16
Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal income taxes attributable to such income. The income of Oxy LP1, Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP will be apportioned through the period up to and including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of Oxy LP1, Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Occidental and the Purchaser agree that all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Purchaser's purchase of the Occidental Partner Subs shall be reported on the Purchaser's consolidated federal income tax return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). 7.6 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns for Periods through Closing Date. For all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Occidental shall cause the Occidental Partner Subs to join in Occidental's consolidated federal income tax return, to join in any applicable combined or unitary state Tax Return filed by Occidental (or an Affiliate) and, in jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from Occidental, to file separate company state and local Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Partnership, except as required by a change in applicable law or except as required for closing the books of Oxy LP1, Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall cause the Partnership and the Occidental Partner Subs to furnish information to Occidental as reasonably requested by Occidental to allow Occidental to satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.6 in accordance with past custom and practice, except that in no event shall such requested information be furnished to Occidental any later than the later of, (i) six months following the Closing Date or (ii) one month following the date such information was requested. Except for items reported by the Partnership, the Occidental Parties and their Affiliates shall not file any Tax Return that departs from past practice that would have a material adverse impact on the Tax attributes or liabilities of Oxy LP2 after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall include the Occidental Partner Subs in its combined or consolidated income tax returns, for all periods other than periods ending on or before the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall not cause any Occidental Partner Sub to file any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. 7.7 Cooperation on Tax Matters. (a) The Purchaser, Occidental Partner Subs and the Occidental Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.7 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other Party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided pursuant to this Section 7.7. The Occidental Parties agree, and shall cause their Affiliates (including the Occidental Partner Subs), to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Occidental Partner Subs relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing Authority. 17
(b) The Purchaser and the Occidental Parties further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Taxes that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). (c) The Purchaser and the Occidental Parties further agree, upon request, to provide the other with all information that such Party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 7.8 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Occidental Partner Subs shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Occidental Partner Subs shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 7.9 Certain Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid 50% by the Occidental Parties or their Affiliate and 50% by the Purchaser when due, and the Occidental Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable law, the Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. 7.10 Audits. Occidental shall fully inform Oxy LP2 regarding issues raised during any audit of Occidental's consolidated federal income Tax Returns to the extent that such returns and such issues relate to the Occidental Partner Subs. Occidental shall not settle any such audit in a manner which would cause Oxy LP2 to include a material item of income in its taxable income in a taxable year ending after the Closing Date without: (i) paying to the Company an amount equal to the present value (calculated using a discount rate equal to LIBOR plus 150 basis points) of the Tax attributable to such increase in taxable income; or (ii) obtaining the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. 7.11 Carrybacks. The Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to make a proper and binding irrevocable election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) on the Purchaser's consolidated federal income tax return to waive the carryback of net operating losses of Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP to taxable years in which Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP were members of Occidental's consolidated federal income tax return. 7.12 Post Closing Elections. At the request of Occidental, the Purchaser shall cause Oxy LP2 and Oxy GP to make or join with Occidental in making any election if the making of such election does not have an adverse impact on the Purchaser or any Occidental Partner Sub for any post-acquisition Tax period. 18
7.13 Consistent Tax Treatment. For all federal and state tax reporting purposes, the Occidental Parties and the Purchaser shall maintain the following positions (except to the extent that such Party receives an opinion from nationally recognized tax counsel that, as a result of a change in applicable law after the date hereof, there is no reasonable basis for maintaining such position): (a) The purchase and sale of the Oxy LP1 Interests, the Oxy LP2 Shares and the Oxy GP Shares are all taxable sales and none of such transactions qualify for treatment as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (b) For all purposes of Subchapter K of the Code, the past practices used to allocate the recourse and nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership among its partners are proper. 7.14 Refunds.

(c) by any Occidental Party if there has been a material misrepresentation or a breach of an agreement by the Purchaser in this Agreement that (i) if such misrepresentation or breach existed on the Closing Date, would constitute a failure to satisfy any condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.2(a) or (b) and (ii) has not been cured and cannot reasonably be cured by the earlier of (x) 30 days after all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied and (y) the Termination Date; (d) by the Purchaser or any Occidental Party in the event that the Closing does not occur for any reason on or before 90 days after the date hereof, as such 90-day period may be extended for up to an additional 120 days upon request of any Party (the "Termination Date"). The right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date unless the failure to Close by such date is due to a breach by both of the Parties (in which case the Purchaser or any Occidental Party may terminate this Agreement as provided by Sections 9.1(b) or 9.1(c), respectively); or (e) by any Party if it becomes impossible to satisfy any condition to that party's performance set forth in Sections 8.2 or 8.3.

SECTION 10 SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION ---------------------------- 10.1 Survival. (a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any Related Purchase Agreement shall not survive the Closing, except that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 shall survive indefinitely, together with any associated right of indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3, (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 shall survive two years after the Closing, and shall thereafter terminate, together with any associated right of indemnification pursuant to Sections 10.2 or 10.3 and (iii) the representations and warranties relating to Taxes or contained in Section 4.7 shall survive until expiration of the applicable statutory period of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof), and shall thereafter 22

(b) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any Related Purchase Agreement shall not be limited or affected by any investigation undertaken by a Party, and shall survive indefinitely, together with any associated right of indemnification. 10.2 Indemnification by the Purchaser. (a) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Occidental Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties, assessments by public agencies, settlement, cost or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and other liabilities (any of the foregoing being a "Loss"), as incurred (payable promptly upon written request), arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser in this Agreement that survives the Closing; and (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser in this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not have any liability with respect to breaches of representations and warranties in this Agreement (i) of which the Occidental Parties have Knowledge as of the Closing Date or (ii) under Section 10.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which the Purchaser would, but for this Section 10.2(b)(i), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to 1% of the purchase price paid pursuant to Section 2.2; provided, however, that after such amount is reached the Purchaser shall be responsible for the full amount of such Loss. 10.3 Indemnification by the Occidental Parties. (a) From and after the Closing, the Occidental Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any Loss, as incurred (payable promptly upon written request), arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Occidental Parties in this Agreement that survives the Closing; and (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Occidental Parties in this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Occidental Parties shall not have any liability with respect to breaches of representations and warranties in this Agreement (i) of which the Purchaser has Knowledge as of the Closing Date or (ii) under Section 10.3(a)(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which the Occidental Parties 23
would, but for this Section 10.3(b)(i), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to 1% of the purchase price paid pursuant to Section 2.2; provided, however, that after such amount is reached the Occidental Parties shall be responsible for the full amount of such Loss. 10.4 Mutual Indemnity. From the date hereof through the twenty-first anniversary hereof: (a) The Purchaser hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Occidental Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any Loss incurred by any of the Occidental Indemnified Parties arising out of, in connection with, or relating to, any Third Party Claim (whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the failure of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to give notice to, obtain any consent of, or obtain any waiver by, or any breach by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of any obligation owing to, any Person, in each case with respect to the Purchaser or its Affiliates' entering into this Agreement or performing their respective obligations hereunder. (b) Each of the Occidental Parties agrees, and Occidental agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any Loss incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of, in connection with, or relating to, any Third Party Claim (whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise) arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the failure of an Occidental Party or any of its Affiliates to give notice to, obtain any consent of, or obtain any waiver by, or any breach by an Occidental Party or any of its Affiliates of any obligation owing to, any Person, in each case with respect to such Occidental Party's or its Affiliates' entering into this Agreement or performing their respective obligations hereunder. 10.5 Mitigation; Limitation on Consequential, Punitive and Exemplary Damages; Exclusive Remedy. (a) Each of the Parties shall mitigate, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to mitigate, any Loss that such Party or its Affiliates may suffer as a consequence of any matter giving rise to a right to indemnification against any other Party or its Affiliates under Section 10 by taking all actions which a reasonable person would undertake to minimize or alleviate the amount of such Loss and the consequences thereof, as if such Person would be required to suffer the entire amount of such Loss and the consequences thereof by itself, without recourse to any remedy against another Person, including pursuant to any right of indemnification hereunder. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnifying Party nor its Affiliates nor their respective agents, employees or representatives shall be liable under Section 10 for consequential, incidental, indirect or punitive damages or lost profits in connection with direct claims by an Indemnified Party (i.e., a claim by an Indemnified Party that does not seek reimbursement for a Third Party Claim paid or 24
payable by the Indemnified Party) with respect to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement unless any such claim arises out of the fraudulent actions of an Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates. (c) The rights provided to each Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10, as limited by and subject to the provisions of this Section 10, shall be such Indemnified Party's sole remedy for breach of any representation or warranty by or covenant or obligation of any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or any Related Purchase Agreement. 10.6 EXTENT OF INDEMNIFICATION. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER SECTION 10.4 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE INDEMNIFIABLE LOSS GIVING RISE TO ANY SUCH INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT OF THE SOLE, GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY ANY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS STATEMENT CONSTITUTES A CONSPICUOUS LEGEND. 10.7 Procedures. (a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Sections 7.3, 10.2 and 10.3, such Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice of a claim for indemnification with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such claim to the extent feasible and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification hereunder; provided that any failure to timely give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations under this Section 10.7(a) except to the extent that such failure prejudices or impairs, in any material respect, any of the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, the Indemnified Party may initiate a judicial proceeding in accordance with the conditions set forth in Sections 11.10, 11.13 and 11.14. (b) If an Indemnified Party is notified of a Third Party Claim which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any Indemnifying Party under Section 10.4, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing (including copies of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such Third Party Claim to the extent feasible and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification hereunder; provided that any failure to timely give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations under this Section 10.6(b) except to the extent that such 25
failure prejudices or impairs, in any material respect, any of the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party. (c) Any Indemnifying Party may, and at the request of the Indemnified Party shall, participate in and control the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or failed to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim or (iii) there shall exist or develop a conflict that would ethically prohibit counsel to the Indemnifying Party from representing the Indemnified Party. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including, without limitation, by making any counterclaim against the person or entity asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any person or entity, in each case only if and to the extent that any such counterclaim or cross-complaint arises from the same actions or facts giving rise to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be the sole judge of the acceptability of any compromise or settlement of any claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party reasonable prior written notice of any such proposed settlement or compromise and will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party (if the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder) shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for its reasonable out of pocket costs incurred with respect to such cooperation. (d) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within a reasonable period after receipt of written notice pursuant to the first sentence of subparagraph (c), or if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Indemnified Party pursuant to subparagraph (c) but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (if the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly and vigorously prosecuted by the Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or settled. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 26
(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 10.7, if the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this Section 10.7 and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to this Section 10.7 or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all costs and expenses of the litigation concerning such dispute. If a dispute over potential liability is resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party in full for all costs of the litigation concerning such dispute. (f) After it has been determined, by acknowledgment, agreement, or ruling of court of law, that an Indemnifying Party is liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section 10, the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of the Loss within ten Business Days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a notice reasonably itemizing the amount of the Loss but only to the extent actually paid or suffered by the Indemnified Party. (g) In the event a Third Party Claim is brought in which the liability as between the Purchaser and an Occidental Party or its Affiliates is alleged to be joint or in which the entitlement to indemnification under this Section 10 has not been determined, the Purchaser and the appropriate Occidental entity shall cooperate in the joint defense of such Third Party Claim and shall offer to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such matter. Such joint defense shall be under the general management and supervision of the Party which is expected to bear the greater share of the liability, unless otherwise agreed; provided, however, that no Party shall settle or compromise any such joint defense matter without the consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any uninsured costs of such joint defense shall be borne as the Parties may agree, provided, however, that in the absence of such agreement, the defense costs shall be borne by the Party incurring such costs; provided, further, that, if it is determined that one Party was entitled to indemnification under this Section 10, the other Parties shall reimburse the Party entitled to indemnification for all of its costs incurred in connection with such defense. 10.8 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any Party pursuant to Section 10.2 and 10.3 shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim pursuant to Section 10.7 to the Indemnifying Party (which notice shall identify the representation or warranty claimed to have been inaccurate, or the covenant claimed to have been breached, and shall state with reasonable particularity the nature of the asserted inaccuracy or breach). 27
SECTION 11 MISCELLANEOUS ------------- 11.1 Successors and Assigns. No Party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of all of the other Parties, which consent shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of each such Party.
