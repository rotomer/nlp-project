Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure - ------ ----------------------------------------- On January 29, 2003, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the fourth quarter 2002 of $322 million ($0.85 per share), compared with a net loss of $247 million ($0.66 per share) for the fourth quarter 2001. The fourth quarter 2001 included a $240 million after-tax charge, reflecting the effect of the agreement to sell Occidental's interest in Equistar. In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our strong fourth quarter performance completed another year of major accomplishments that included exceeding our combined oil and natural gas production forecast, the continued strengthening of our balance sheet and the generation of competitive returns on equity and capital employed. Oil and gas production in the fourth quarter averaged 518,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. That's 7.5 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2001 and keeps us on target to meet or exceed our 2003 forecast of 525,000 BOE per day. We ended the year with our debt to capitalization ratio at 43 percent, the lowest level in 21 years. Our strong earnings performance produced a return on equity of nearly 17 percent and return on capital employed of almost 11 percent." OIL AND GAS ----------- Oil and gas segment and core earnings were $490 million for the fourth quarter 2002, compared with $166 million for the fourth quarter 2001. The improvement in the fourth quarter 2002 earnings reflected $299 million from higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices and a $35 million increase from higher production volumes; partially offset by higher exploration expense. CHEMICALS --------- Chemical segment earnings were $58 million for the fourth quarter 2002, compared with a loss of $412 million for the fourth quarter 2001. The 2001 loss resulted from a $412 million pre-tax charge, reflecting the effect of the sale of the company's interest in the Equistar petrochemicals joint venture. Chemical core earnings also were $58 million for the fourth quarter 2002, compared with breakeven core earnings for the fourth quarter 2001. The improvement in the fourth quarter 2002 core earnings reflected higher sales prices for PVC, chlorine and EDC, lower self-insured reserve requirements and the absence of the Equistar fourth quarter 2001 loss; partially offset by lower caustic sales prices and higher energy and raw material costs. TWELVE-MONTH RESULTS -------------------- For the twelve months of 2002, net income was $989 million ($2.63 per share), compared with $1.154 billion ($3.10 per share) for the twelve months of 2001. Core earnings were $999 million for 2002 compared with $1.246 billion for 2001. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of earnings to core earnings. For details of items affecting the comparability of core earnings between periods in 2002 and 2001, see the attached schedule. 1
Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will" or "expect", or otherwise related to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations, and supply/demand consideration for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 2
SUMMARY OF SEGMENT NET SALES AND EARNINGS ($ millions, except per-share amounts) See footnotes on following page. 3
(a) Includes interest income on notes receivable from Altura partners. The partnership exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers' remaining partnership interests in exchange for the outstanding balance on the notes. The twelve months 2002 amount includes $21 million and the fourth quarter and twelve months 2001 amounts include $17 million and $102 million, respectively. (b) Excludes U.S. federal income tax charges and credits allocated to the segments and foreign taxes. Oil and gas segment earnings include credits of $1 million in both the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001. Chemical segment earnings include a credit of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter 2001 amount includes a $172 million credit reflecting the statutory tax effect of the agreement, in principle, to sell Occidental's interest in Equistar. Oil and gas segment earnings for the twelve months 2002 and 2001 include charges of $1 million and $36 million, respectively. The amounts include charges for asset sales of $4 million and $39 million for the years 2002 and 2001, respectively. Chemical segment earnings have been impacted by credits of $403 million for the twelve months 2002 and by credits of $42 million for the twelve months 2001. The 2002 amount includes a $392 million credit for the tax effects of the sale of the Equistar investment and the 2001 amount includes $26 million of credits for asset sales. (c) Includes preferred distributions to the Occidental Permian partners. The twelve months 2002 amount includes $22 million. The fourth quarter and twelve months 2001 amounts include $17 million and $104 million, respectively. This is essentially offset by the interest income discussed in (a) above. The partnership exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers' remaining partnership interests in exchange for the outstanding balance on the notes. The twelve months 2001 amount includes a $272 million net-of-tax loss related to the sale of Occidental's residual interest in Occidental Texas Pipeline Company. 4
SUMMARY OF OPERATING STATISTICS 5
SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The following table sets forth the core earnings and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate: *These amounts are shown after tax. 6
ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF CORE EARNINGS BETWEEN PERIODS (a) Includes share of Equistar results that were previously reported in the Chemical segment. 7
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure - ------ ------------------------ Text of Speech by Stephen I. Chazen, Chief Financial Officer and ---------------------------------------------------------------- Executive Vice President - Corporate Development ------------------------------------------------ Occidental Petroleum Corporation STEPHEN CHAZEN Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President - Corporate Development - Conference Call - Fourth Quarter 2002 Earnings Announcement January 29, 2003 Los Angeles, California Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Those of you who have not received a copy of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings, along with the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules, can find them on our website - oxy.com or on the SEC's EDGAR site. We have added two schedules to the format we used in previous earnings announcements. The first schedule lists the "Significant Transactions and Events Affecting Earnings" that impacted reported fourth quarter and annual earnings for 2002 and 2001. We have narrowly defined the term "Significant Transactions and Events" to include only material gains and losses, discontinued operations and changes in accounting standards. The second schedule contains a list of items affecting comparability between quarters and annually. We leave it to the individual users of this schedule to decide whether to adjust our core earnings by segment or reporting period. For the fourth quarter of 2002 these are U. S. source items so it would be appropriate to apply a 35 percent tax rate to them. Net income for the quarter was $322 million, or $0.85 per share. Net income for the 2001 fourth quarter was a loss of $247 million, or $0.66 per share. If the 2001 fourth quarter transactions and events are eliminated, core earnings for the quarter would have been a loss of $4 million, or 1-cent per share. On a segment basis, oil and gas fourth quarter earnings were $490 million, compared to $166 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. The following factors affected fourth quarter earnings. o The increase in fourth quarter 2002 worldwide oil and gas price realizations added $299 million of earnings over the comparable period in 2001. 8
o Production in the fourth quarter 2002 was 7.5 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2001 and accounted for $35 million of earnings. Production started up at Horn Mountain late in the fourth quarter. When this project becomes fully operational later this year, we expect our share of production to be approximately 20,000 BOE per day. o Exploration expense was $61 million in the quarter compared to $54 million in fourth quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter 2002 expense includes a $25 million write-off for the Thunderball deep gas well in California. For the year 2002, oil and gas segment earnings were $1.7 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2001. The single largest factor accounting for the variance was substantially higher natural gas prices in 2001, particularly in California, which made up $830 million of the difference. The other major factor was the 2001 sale of our Indonesian gas interests for $399 million. These factors were partially offset by higher oil prices and higher production in 2002. Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter 2002 were $58 million compared to a loss of $412 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter 2001 included a pre-tax charge of $412 million related to the announced sale of our interest in Equistar. Excluding this significant item, earnings from our core chemical operations were break-even in the 2001 fourth quarter. The primary factors affecting fourth quarter 2002 chemical earnings compared to the 2001 fourth quarter were: o higher chlorine, PVC and ethylene dichloride prices, and; o the elimination of the Equistar loss. The chemical business weakened in October and November, but strengthened in December. PVC markets and prices are strong and we expect caustic prices to strengthen this year. For the year, our consolidated net income was $989 million, or $2.63 per share, compared to $1.2 billion, or $3.10 per share, in 2001. Cash flow from operations for the year was approximately $2.1 billion. Interest expense, including distributions on trust-preferred securities, was $70 million during the fourth quarter 2002, compared to $92 million in the 2001 fourth quarter. Included in the fourth quarter of 2001 was a one-time charge of $8 million relating to early debt extinguishment. For the year 2002, total interest expense of $320 million was $112 million less than our interest expense in 2001. Turning to the year-end 2002 balance sheet, we increased shareholder equity to $6.3 billion, or $684 million higher than the year-end 2001 level. At the same time, we reduced total debt by $131 million to $4.76 billion, compared to $4.89 billion at the end of 2001. At the end of last year, our debt to total capitalization ratio was down to 43-percent, compared to 46-percent at the end of 2001. 9
At the end of the year we had approximately $146 million of cash. Capital spending for the quarter was $396 million and $1.2 billion for the year. We expect total spending for 2003 to be at roughly the same level. The company also made acquisitions in 2002 totaling $485 million, including $350 for our interest in the Dolphin Project. As we look forward in the first quarter of this year: o We expect production to average about 525,000 BOE per day - which is consistent with our 2003 forecast. This could vary slightly due to high oil prices affecting our production sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and THUMS. Also, Colombia production is always difficult to forecast. o We expect exploration expense for the quarter to be about $35 million. o Chemical earnings should be in the range of $60 million. This outlook is based on current conditions featuring high energy prices and new prices for caustic as well as seasonal factors which typically result in the fourth and first quarters being weak. We expect quarterly earnings to increase during the remainder of the year. o We expect interest expense, including distributions on trust-preferred securities, to be about $75 million. This does not include an unusual charge which I'll discuss later. o We record the equity earnings from our 34.5 million shares of Lyondell in corporate "Other" and we rely on the estimates provided by Lyondell's management. o A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts segment quarterly earnings by about $27.5 million. The WTI price in the fourth quarter was $28.15. A swing of 10-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $6 million impact on quarterly oil and gas earnings. The NYMEX gas price for the fourth quarter was $3.57. o Our tax rate in the first quarter should be about 33 percent. This reflects our expectation of higher U.S. source income during 2003 than in 2002. There are three unusual items we expect in the first quarter. 1) The adoption of accounting standard 143, which is related to asset abandonment costs, requires companies to record on their books the present value of the liability for the ultimate abandonment of the fixed asset when the asset is placed in service. For Oxy, this is expected to result in a non-cash cumulative catch-up charge of approximately $50 million after-tax in the first quarter for assets currently in service. This is primarily related to on-shore oil and gas properties. In addition, there will be an annual pre-tax non-cash charge to income of about $17 million to reflect the accretion of the liability and higher depreciation expense. The actual cash abandonment cost will not be incurred until the asset is retired. 10
2) The FASB has rescinded EITF Issue Number 98-10 that was in effect since 1999 which required the mark to market of non-derivative trading positions. In Oxy's case, non-derivative energy trading positions relate mainly to physical natural gas inventories. As a result of the change by FASB, we must reverse the mark to market gain for the physical gas inventory that was on our books at year-end. This reversal will result in a non-cash, after-tax charge of about $18 million in the first quarter. As the gas is sold, we will book the gains in operating income. We expect to realize about $13 million in income in the first quarter and the remainder later in the year. 3) We also expect to record a pre-tax interest charge of $50-$70 million to repay a $450 million bond issue that has 10 years of remaining life. We intend to refinance this issue. This action will lower our future interest expense. We have been focusing on improving our returns on equity and capital employed - and the results have been striking as we have moved from the bottom to the top quartile among our oil and gas competitors during the last four years. For the year 2002, our return on equity was nearly 17 percent and the four year average from 1999 through 2002 was about 21 percent. During that same four-year period our equity increased from $3.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Our return on capital employed for 2002 was 11 percent and the four year average was 13 percent. And finally, I would like to remind everyone that we announced a 4 percent increase in our annual dividend rate last December and indicated that we would review our dividend policy annually. Our chairman and CEO, Dr. Ray Irani, is traveling on business and is unable to tie into this conference call. I am joined this morning by our president, Dale Laurance, and we're now ready to answer questions. 11

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] SUMMARY OF OPERATING STATISTICS ------------------------------- 22
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CHEMICALS Volume (M Tons) CHEMICALS Prices (Index) CHLORINE - -------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Overall demand in the 4th quarter was down as expected due to the seasonal decline in the PVC market. However, a rebound occurred in December as buyers began building inventories in anticipation of a stronger 1st quarter demand. o Industry effective operating rates dropped to 85% in the 4th quarter from 94% in the 3rd quarter. Rates are expected to increase in the 1st quarter 2003 as demand continues to improve. o Despite the reduced operating rates, prices remained stable throughout the 4th quarter, aided by expectations of a tightening market in early 2003. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - ------------------- An expected economic recovery in 2003 combined with a lack of new capacity is expected to tighten the market, increase operating rates and improve prices. 23
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] CAUSTIC - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Demand for caustic soda continued to improve in the 4th quarter despite a seasonal slowdown in the bleach market. Demand improved in several major market segments including pulp and paper, refining, organic chemicals and alumina. Demand in the 1st quarter 2003 is expected to remain at current levels. o Domestic pricing for caustic soda improved as a result of a $50 per ton price increase announced by U.S. producers for the 4th quarter. An additional $70 per ton increase was announced for the 1st quarter 2003 but subsequently moderated to $40 per ton. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - ------------------- Supply and demand for caustic soda remains balanced. Demand is dependent on the US manufacturing sector. The anticipated improvement in the US economy in conjunction with a strengthening global economy and reduced US operating capacity is expected to support continued price improvement. EDC - --- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o The supply/demand balance tightened in the 4th quarter as a result of low inventory levels of PVC, VCM and EDC in Asia. o The downward pressure on prices experienced in the 3rd quarter and early in the 4th quarter has reversed itself. As the PVC market has improved, buyers have been accepting higher EDC prices in anticipation of higher PVC prices. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - ------------------- Continued growth in China and an increasing demand for EDC, VCM and PVC is expected to result in further improvements in EDC prices. PVC/VCM - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Demand was slow going into the 4th quarter due to the seasonal slowdown in the pipe sector. This changed in mid-December as resin producers began announcing price increases for January and pipe prices improved. o OxyVinyls' PVC operating rates for the 4th quarter were at 88%. The estimated industry average operating rate was 85%. The feedstock shortages seen earlier in the 24
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] year have temporarily eased as producers had sufficient chlorine and VCM to operate at rates necessary to meet demand and rebuild some inventory. Capacities used to calculate operating rates have been modified to exclude both the former Borden Geismar and Addis facilities, which are currently idle. These plants are not expected to start up during the 1st half of 2003. o Domestic PVC resin market prices decreased $.01/lb in September, October, and November, and were flat in December. A $.02/lb increase was implemented January 1, 2003. An additional $.02/lb increase was announced by several resin producers for February. o Demand for PVC exports to Asia was weak going into the quarter but improved in November due to VCM outages and raw material shortages in the region. Prices bottomed out at $470/MT in mid-November, increasing to $520-530/MT in late-November and $580-600/MT by late-December. o Demand for VCM tapered off gradually throughout the quarter, due primarily to seasonal reductions in the PVC market, although not as much as previously expected. Some VCM producers reduced rates in an effort to manage inventory levels, while others built inventory for planned outages in early 2003 or attempted to capitalize on spot shipments. Demand is expected to increase in the 1st quarter 2003 as the PVC market improves. o Export VCM prices declined in 4th quarter, which is typical for this time of the year. The export price peaked in July at the $510-$530/MT but fell each month, finishing the year at the $400-$420/MT level in December. Increased PVC demand and pricing is expected to lead to improved prices for VCM in the 1st quarter 2003. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - ------------------- Increased demand and operating rates will result in increased prices for PVC and VCM in the 1st quarter 2003, offsetting expected increases in energy and feedstock costs. 25
