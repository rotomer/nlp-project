EXHIBIT 99.1 ==================================================================== [OXY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION ==================================================================== 10889 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90024 (310) 208-8800 For Immediate Release: October 21, 2003 OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2003 RESULTS --------------------------------------------------------- LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) announced net income for the third quarter 2003 of $446 million ($1.16 per share), compared with $402 million ($1.07 per share) for the third quarter 2002. In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Core earnings of $446 million, or $1.16 per share, were 43 percent higher than the $312 million, or $0.83 per share, the company earned in the third quarter of 2002. Higher oil and gas prices and a nine percent increase in production contributed to a 35 percent increase in oil and gas earnings over last year's third quarter. Core earnings of $1.25 billion, or $3.27 per share, for the first nine months of 2003 were 85 percent higher than the $676 million, or $1.80 per share, the company earned in the comparable period last year." OIL AND GAS ----------- Oil and gas segment earnings were $660 million for the third quarter 2003, compared with $490 million for the third quarter 2002. The improvement in the third quarter 2003 earnings reflected higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices and increased crude oil sales volumes; partially offset by higher exploration expenses and operating costs. The increased crude oil production results largely from higher Ecuador production, reflecting the completion of the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. oil export pipeline, and Horn Mountain production, which came on line in the fourth quarter 2002. 1
CHEMICALS --------- Chemical core earnings were $61 million for the third quarter 2003, compared with $50 million for the third quarter 2002. The third quarter 2002 core earnings excluded a $164 million net of tax gain from the sale of the investment in Equistar. The third quarter 2003 results reflected higher sales prices in chlor-alkali, which were more than offset by higher energy and raw material costs. The third quarter 2002 core earnings included a $37 million pre-tax charge for the impairment of various operating assets. NINE MONTHS RESULTS ------------------- For the first nine months of 2003, net income was $1.15 billion ($2.99 per share), compared with $667 million ($1.77 per share) for the first nine months of 2002. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2003 were $1.25 billion ($3.27 per share), compared with $676 million ($1.80 per share) for 2002. The debt to total capitalization ratio was 38 percent compared with 43 percent at the end of last year. See the attached schedules for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the third quarter and nine months. -0- Contacts: Lawrence P. Meriage (media) 310-443-6562 Kenneth J.

SUMMARY OF SEGMENT NET SALES AND EARNINGS ($ millions, except per-share amounts) See footnotes on following page. 3
(a) The nine-months 2003 includes a $61 million interest charge to repay a $450-million 6.4-percent senior-notes issue that had ten years of remaining life, but was subject to remarketing on April 1, 2003. The nine months 2002 includes $22 million of interest income on notes receivable from Altura partners. The partnership exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers' remaining partnership interests in exchange for the outstanding balance on the notes. (b) Excludes U.S. federal income tax charges and credits allocated to the segments and foreign taxes. Oil and gas segment earnings include a credit of $1 million in the third quarter of 2003 and a charge of $3 million in the third quarter of 2002. Chemical segment earnings include a $395 million credit in the third quarter of 2002, almost entirely related to the sale of the Equistar investment. Oil and gas segment earnings for the nine-months 2003 and 2002 include charges of $6 million and $2 million, respectively. Chemical segment earnings include credits of $403 million for the nine months 2002. (c) The nine-months 2002 includes $20 million of preferred distributions to the Occidental Permian partners. This is essentially offset by the interest income discussed in (a) above. The partnership exercised an option in May 2002 to redeem the sellers' remaining partnership interests in exchange for the outstanding balance on the notes. The nine-months 2003 also includes $42 million equity losses from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, compared with $3 million losses for the same period in 2002. (d) Effective January 1, 2003, Occidental implemented SFAS No. 143 - "Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations." Adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in a cumulative after-tax reduction in net income of $50 million. Also effective January 1, 2003, Occidental implemented the rescission of EITF 98-10, which precludes mark-to-market accounting for all energy-trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Adoption of this accounting change resulted in a cumulative after-tax reduction in net income of $18 million. Effective January 1, 2002, Occidental implemented SFAS No. 142 - "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in a cumulative after-tax reduction in net income of $95 million. 4
SUMMARY OF OPERATING STATISTICS 5
SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The following table sets forth the core earnings and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate: *These amounts are shown after tax. 6

EXHIBIT 99.2 OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION STEPHEN CHAZEN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT - CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT - CONFERENCE CALL - THIRD QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT OCTOBER 21, 2003 Los Angeles, California Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If you would like a copy of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings, along with the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules, you can find them on our website www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR system. Reported and core earnings for the third quarter were $446 million, or $1.16 per share, compared with last year's third quarter reported earnings of $402 million, or $1.07 per share, and core earnings of $312 million, or $0.83 per share. The improvement was driven mainly by higher energy prices and increased oil production. o The price of WTI for the quarter averaged $30.20 per barrel compared to $28.27 per barrel in last year's third quarter. o Worldwide oil and gas production for the quarter was 546,000 barrels of oil equivalent - an increase of 9 percent compared with the 502,000 barrels we produced in last year's third quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter this year we have set new production records. 1
o For the first nine months, production was up by 5 percent compared to last year - from 513,000 to 541,000 BOE per day. o WTI averaged $30.98 per barrel for the first nine months compared with $25.39 for the comparable period last year, for an increase of 22 percent. Core earnings for the first nine months of $1.25 billion, or $3.27 per share, were 85 percent higher than the $676 million, or $1.80 per share, we earned for the comparable period last year. On a segment basis, oil and gas third quarter earnings were $660 million - 35 percent higher than the $490 million in earnings during the same period a year ago. As I noted earlier, the increase was due primarily to higher prices and increased production. Chemical segment earnings were $61 million compared to third quarter 2002 earnings of $214 million, which included an after-tax gain of $164 million for the sale of our Equistar interest. Core chemical business earnings of $61 million for the quarter exceed last year's third quarter core earnings of $50 million by 22 percent. This year's third quarter core chemical earnings represent an $18 million improvement compared to the second quarter. While lower product prices, which were slightly offset by better volumes, resulted in a net decline of $21 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, this decline was more than offset by $25 million in improvements resulting from lower energy and feedstock costs and internal cost reductions. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was approximately $750 million and $2.2 billion for the first nine months. 2
Turning to the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we increased shareholder equity to $7.5 billion, or $441 million higher than at the end of the second quarter. During the first nine months of the year, shareholder equity increased by a total of $1.2 billion, an improvement of 19 percent above the year-end 2002 level. Our debt-to-total capitalization was down to 38 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 40 percent at the end of the second quarter and 43 percent at the end of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $529 million in cash on the balance sheet. We expect to call $454 million in 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Securities in December to be redeemed in January. During the quarter, Moody's upgraded our credit rating to Baa1. This follows upgrades by S&P and Fitch to BBB+ during the second quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $360 million and $1.15 billion for the first nine months, including $180 million for the chemical plant lease buyout in the second quarter and $44 million for the buyout of chemical railcar leases in the first quarter. Excluding the lease buyouts, we expect total capital spending for the year to be approximately $1.4 billion - with oil and gas accounting for about 90 percent of the expenditures. As we look ahead in the current quarter: o We expect oil and gas production to increase modestly in the fourth quarter due primarily to the startup of the new oil pipeline in Ecuador known by its Spanish acronym OCP. The pipeline began operations on September 1 and we will be increasing production during the fourth quarter from the new Eden-Yuturi field as well as from other recent discoveries in Block 15. o Production also can be impacted from quarter to quarter due to price-driven adjustments in the volumes under our production- 3
sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and our THUMS operation in Long Beach. In addition, our Colombia production is always difficult to forecast. o We expect exploration expense for the quarter to be about $35 million. o The fourth and first quarters are typically the weakest quarters for the chemical business due to seasonal factors. We therefore expect fourth quarter chemical earnings to be in the $45 to $55 million range. o We expect fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $66 million. That includes what we expect will be the final quarterly payment on our Trust Preferred Securities. o A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings by about $30 million. As I noted earlier, the WTI price in the third quarter was $30.20 per barrel. A swing of 10-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $5 million impact on quarterly segment earnings. The NYMEX gas price for the third quarter was $5.59 per thousand cubic feet. o Our overall effective tax rate, both foreign and U.S., is about 43%. Our reported oil and gas earnings are after foreign taxes. We expect our U.S. tax rate in the 4th quarter, which applies to the net, to be the same 30 percent as it was in the first nine months. o We currently own approximately 39 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Company, which we account for on an equity basis. We have no way of forecasting Lyondell's results. Now we're ready to take your questions. 4

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] CHLORINE - -------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Seasonal demand was hindered by milder and wetter weather. This negatively impacted the bleach, water treatment and titanium dioxide market segments. o Pricing declined slightly in the 3rd quarter due to a slowdown in seasonal demand, increased global competition experienced by our customers, and a decline in industry operating rates. o Chlorine industry operating rates declined approximately 2% to 90% in the 3rd quarter versus 2nd quarter 2003. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Industry operating rates are not expected to improve in the 4th quarter. CAUSTIC - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Demand for caustic soda declined marginally in the 3rd quarter due to reduced volume into the pulp and paper and refining markets. Caustic soda demand is expected to ease further throughout the 4th quarter due to seasonality. o The price increase of $50 per ton announced for July 1st was unsuccessful. Strong competitive activity and the influence of significant increases in imported caustic brought pricing under pressure and adversely impacted the implementation of the price increase. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The supply/demand balance for caustic soda remains fragile. Industry capacity rationalization and improvement in the U.S. manufacturing sector would provide support for future price improvement. However, elevated chlorine operating rates and increased imports could negatively impact future caustic price increases during periods of weak demand. EDC - --- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o EDC values remained flat in the 3rd quarter in spite of improved VCM and PVC demand in the Far East. 13
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] o Unplanned and extended VCM outages in the US and Asia have weakened the EDC supply/demand balance. This is expected to continue throughout the 4th quarter. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- PVC production in China via the calcium carbide process has negatively impacted EDC demand and diluted some of the anticipated growth in 2003. PVC/VCM - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Reduced 2nd quarter customer inventories and favorable weather led to an improvement in 3rd quarter PVC sales demand. Inventories are at moderate levels going into the 4th quarter. o VCM outages in the U.S. and Asia allowed for price increases at the end of the 3rd quarter and will support price stability in the 4th quarter. o Capacities still exclude the former Borden Geismar and Addis facilities, which remain idle. There is little indication that either plant will restart in 2004. o July PVC pricing was down $.01/lb with August holding steady. The September increase of $.02/lb has been supported in the marketplace. o Demand and pricing for PVC exports improved slightly in the 3rd quarter due mostly to outages in Asia. 3rd quarter pricing ended at $650/MT. o The VCM market is tight with Pemex and Dow currently in an outage and PHH Lake Charles resuming production following their outage. OxyVinyls should benefit with increased 4th quarter sales. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Increased demand in both the domestic and export markets led to improved 3rd quarter margins. 4th quarter margins will be dependant on continued demand and raw material balances. 14
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] SUMMARY OF OPERATING STATISTICS ------------------------------- 1 Includes $180 for buyout of VCM plant lease and $44 for buyout of railcar leases 15
