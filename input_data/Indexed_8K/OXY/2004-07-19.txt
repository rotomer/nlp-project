Item 5. Other Events 1. Earnings Release - -- ---------------- Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced on July 19, 2004, net income for the second quarter 2004 of $581 million ($1.48 per share), compared with $374 million ($0.98 per share) for the second quarter 2003. Oil and Gas ----------- Oil and gas segment and core earnings were $814 million for the second quarter 2004, compared with $637 million for the second quarter 2003. The improvement in the second quarter 2004 earnings reflected approximately $294 million from higher worldwide crude oil and gas prices and increased sales volumes; partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates. The second quarter 2003 included $14 million in after-tax gains on asset sales. Chemicals --------- Chemical segment and core earnings were $85 million for the second quarter 2004, compared with $43 million for the second quarter 2003. The improvement in the second quarter 2004 results was primarily due to higher sales volumes for all major products and higher sales prices for vinyl chloride monomer, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride and chlorine; partially offset by lower caustic soda prices and higher ethylene and energy costs. The second quarter 2003 included a $9 million asset-writedown charge and a $15 million severance charge. Six-Months Results ------------------ For the first six months of 2004, net income was $1.07 billion ($2.72 per share), compared with $699 million ($1.84 per share) for the first six months of 2003. Core earnings were $1.06 billion for 2004 compared with $807 million for 2003. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings. Statements in this release that contain words such as "will" or "expect," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations, and supply/demand consideration for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 1
SUMMARY OF SEGMENT NET SALES AND EARNINGS 2
(a) The six months 2004 includes an $11 million pre-tax interest charge to redeem all the outstanding 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Redeemable Securities on January 20, 2004. The six months 2003 includes a $61 million pre-tax interest charge to repay a $450 million 6.4 percent senior notes issue that had ten years of remaining life, but was subject to re-marketing on April 1, 2003. (b) The six months 2004 includes a $20 million credit related to a first quarter settlement of an issue with the Internal Revenue Service. The second quarter of 2004 reflected a lower U.S. income tax rate resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. 3

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The following table sets forth the core earnings and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate: 5

EXHIBIT 99.1 OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION STEPHEN CHAZEN SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER - CONFERENCE CALL - SECOND QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT JULY 19, 2004 Los Angeles, California Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If you would like a copy of the press release announcing our second quarter earnings, along with the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules, you can find them on our website www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR system. Reported and core earnings for the second quarter were $ 581 million, or $1.48 per share, compared with $374 million, or $0.98 per share in the second quarter of 2003. The improvement was driven mainly by higher energy prices and increased oil and gas production. o Oil and gas production for the quarter averaged 574,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 544,000 barrels in last year's second quarter. For the first half of this year, worldwide production was up by 6 percent compared to last year - from 538,000 to 571,000 BOE per day. For the first half of this year, core earnings were $1.06 billion, or $2.69 per share compared to $807 million, or $2.12 per share, during the first half of 2003. On a segment basis, oil and gas second quarter earnings were $814 million, compared to $637 million during the same period a year ago. As I 1
noted earlier, the increase was due primarily to higher prices and increased production, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates. Chemical segment earnings were $85 million compared to second quarter 2003 earnings of $43 million. Higher prices for vinyl chloride monomer, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride and chlorine contributed to improved margins that were partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs. Our core chemical business earnings of $135 million for the first half compares to last year's first half earnings of $78 million. Included in last year's second quarter chemical results was $15 million in severance expenses resulting from a significant reorganization of our chemical business that was focused on reducing overhead as well as a $9 million write-off of certain assets at a chemical plant. We reduced our debt-like obligations during the quarter by $360 million by discontinuing the sale of an interest in our outstanding accounts receivable balance. This action reduced our cash flow from operations for the first half of the year from approximately $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion. Discontinuing the sale of the receivables, together with the first quarter redemption of our share of the debt for the Elk Hills power plant and $453 million of trust preferred securities, has reduced our obligations since the beginning of the year by just over a billion dollars. Our net interest expense, including the trust preferred distributions, declined to $60 million for the quarter and $128 million for the first half compared to $64 million and $199 million for the comparable periods last year. At the end of the quarter, stockholders' equity had grown to $9 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio was down to 31 percent compared 2
to 37 percent at the end of last year. We had $383 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $461 million and $804 million for the first half - with oil and gas accounting for more than 90 percent of the expenditures. As we look ahead in the current quarter: o We expect oil and gas production to remain at about the same level as the second quarter. o We expect exploration expense for the quarter to be about $45 million. o We see the upturn in chemical markets continuing in the third quarter. We expect some margin improvement as well as high utilization rates. Therefore, we expect third quarter chemical earnings to be in the $100 million range, compared to $85 million in the second quarter. o We expect third quarter interest expense to be approximately the same as the second quarter. o A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts segment annual earnings by about $138 million, before the effect of foreign income taxes. The average WTI price in the second quarter was $38.32 per barrel. A swing of 10-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $5 million impact on quarterly oil and gas earnings. The NYMEX gas price for the second quarter was $5.79 per million BTUs. Our average realized price for the second quarter was $4.26, and we expect our realized price for the third quarter to be about $4.90. 3
o Our worldwide effective tax rate for the second quarter was 40 percent. The second quarter reflects a lower U. S. income tax rate resulting from the crediting of foreign income taxes. Previously, foreign income taxes were taken as a deduction from U. S. income taxes. U. S. taxpayers may elect annually to apply whichever method is more beneficial. The effect of this change resulted in an improvement of approximately 8 cents per share in second quarter earnings. We expect to make this election every year from now on. This will not only result in improved earnings for the remainder of 2004, but in future years. We expect the rate for the rest of this year to be about 40 percent. Both our U. S. and foreign tax rates are included in the "Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule" which has been modified to reflect the effect of this tax election. o We record the equity earnings from our investment in Lyondell Chemical Company in corporate "Other". We currently own about 41 million Lyondell shares. We have no way of forecasting the quarterly equity earnings from our Lyondell investment, although the outlook for the business appears to be favorable. Now we're ready to take your questions. 4

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CHEMICALS Volume (M Tons, except PVC Resins) CHEMICALS Prices (Index) 1987 through 1990 average price = 1.00 CHLORINE - -------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Chlorine operating rates were at maximum practical capacity in the 2nd quarter due to strong seasonal demand. o As contract terms permitted, OxyChem fully implemented the $75 per ton price increase announced in the 1st quarter. o OxyChem and other U.S. producers announced a $20 per ton increase to be effective July 1. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable for the successful implementation of the announced price increase. o OxyChem continues to manage chlorine shipments via a 100% order control program. Other major merchant producers also announced order control programs in the 2nd quarter. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Avoiding customer shutdowns will remain difficult due to tight chorine supply/demand conditions, reduced inventories and deteriorating rail service. Continued strong 13
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] seasonal demand for chlorine is expected to further tighten the supply/demand balance in the 3rd quarter. CAUSTIC - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Caustic soda demand continued to strengthen with 2nd quarter sales improving over 1st quarter volumes due to strong demand in the pulp and paper, bleach, and distribution markets. o Seasonal applications are expected to support continued strong demand for caustic soda through the 3rd quarter. o Increased requirements for liquid caustic soda and a narrowing supply/demand balance have necessitated the implementation of order control programs for many U.S. producers. o Asian supply/demand balance tightened dramatically over the quarter, with spot U.S. export prices rising dramatically from lows in April. o Between late April and May, OxyChem and other U.S. producers announced price increases totaling $95 per dry short ton. The increases are expected to be largely realized in the 3rd quarter as contract terms permit. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- A narrowing supply/demand imbalance for liquid caustic soda will continue to lend support for future price improvement in 2004 as demand keeps pace with high chlorine industry operating rates. EDC - --- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o The gap between EDC and VCM prices narrowed in the 2nd quarter as EDC prices gained upward momentum due to the combination of higher VCM operating rates and scheduled EDC outages. o The tightness in the chlorine market limited the availability of U.S. produced EDC in the 2nd quarter. o Raw material and power availability within China has restricted calcium carbide based VCM production. This has increased demand for both EDC and VCM into Asia. 14
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Reduced EDC demand could result from VCM production curtailments in the Far East if the profit margins for converting EDC to VCM face downward pressure due to high ethylene costs. VCM prices are expected to limit EDC prices in the 3rd quarter. PVC/VCM - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Robust demand in the construction sector led to strong domestic PVC sales in the 2nd quarter. Inventories at PVC producers continued to decline while they remained at moderate levels at pipe producers and distributors. o Export sales volumes for PVC held strong in the 2nd quarter and netbacks to all regions remained healthy. However, Chinese demand for PVC was negatively influenced when the Chinese government restricted lending and the producers faced energy issues that curtailed VCM and PVC production rates. o Both the Westlake Geismar and Shintech Addis facilities remain idle. There is no indication that either plant will restart in 2004. o North American producers operated at near capacity for both PVC resin and VCM during the 2nd quarter. o Domestic PVC resin prices increased $0.02 per pound in April and $0.01 per pound in both May and June. Additional increases of a $0.01 per pound have been announced for both July and August. o PVC resin export prices ended the quarter at $815 - $840 per metric ton CFR Southeast Asia. o Pemex experienced VCM operating problems in the 2nd quarter, contributing to a VCM supply/demand position that remained balanced to tight. o VCM export prices closed the 2nd quarter at $630 - $640 per metric ton FOB Gulf Coast. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- While prices have moved up, margin improvement has been limited due to high energy and ethylene costs. Strong global demand for PVC and VCM coupled with a tight VCM supply will provide support for future price improvement throughout the vinyl's chain. Continued economic recovery is expected to sustain a strong vinyl's business environment through the 3rd quarter. 15
