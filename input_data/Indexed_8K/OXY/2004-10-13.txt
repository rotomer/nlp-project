SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS Item 8.01. Other Events - ---------- ------------ As announced on October 12, 2004, by Vulcan Materials Company and Occidental Chemical Corporation, Basic Chemical Company, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental Chemical, has agreed to purchase three chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan Materials Company. Occidental Chemical Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The primary products produced at the three facilities are chlorine, its co-product caustic soda, and ethylene dichloride (EDC). The transaction was structured as a purchase of assets. Initially the purchaser will pay Vulcan $214 million in cash subject to adjustment for changes in net working capital of the purchased businesses. In addition, the purchaser may become obligated to make contingent payments based upon the future performance of the purchased businesses, and will assume specified obligations. Vulcan has retained the liabilities associated with the acquired businesses not assumed by the purchaser, including, without limitation, all pending litigation and all liabilities arising from the use of perchloroethylene in the dry cleaning business. Closing of the transaction is subject to customary regulatory closing conditions. The full text of the press release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. Occidental has not provided a GAAP measure of financial performance with respect to the disclosure of EBITDA of the acquired facilities made in the press release. It is impractical to provide such a measure because Basic is acquiring only a portion of the contracts associated with the business, none of the debt and all of a related joint venture that operates a portion of the Geismar complex being acquired.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ==================================================================== [OXY LOGO] NEWS RELEASE OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION ==================================================================== 10889 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90024 (310) 208-8800 For Immediate Release: October 12, 2004 OXYCHEM TO ACQUIRE VULCAN'S CHLORINE-CAUSTIC -------------------------------------------- SODA MANUFACTURING PLANTS ------------------------- LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY), announced today that it has agreed to purchase three chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan Materials Company for $214 million in cash, plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these businesses. The primary products produced at the three facilities are chlorine, with a combined annual capacity of approximately 815,000 tons, its co-product caustic soda, and 315,000 tons of ethylene dichloride (EDC). OxyChem currently has the annual capacity to produce approximately 3,100,000 tons of chlorine and 1,500,000 tons of EDC. During 2003, the assets being acquired generated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $40 million. Current estimated annual capital expenditures for these facilities are $20 million. Stephen I. Chazen, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, said "OxyChem believes it has significant operational and overhead synergies with the Vulcan operations which should reduce costs by at least $40 million per year. We believe this strategic acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will enhance Occidental's earnings, cash flow and return on capital employed." -0- Contacts: Lawrence P.

Huffman (investors) 212-603-8183 On the web: www.oxy.com Note: The reported historic performance of the businesses acquired is based on information provided by the seller which, while believed to be accurate, has not been audited. In addition, statements in this press release that contain words such as "believes", "will" or "expect", or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from expectations include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations, and
supply/demand considerations for chemicals; higher-than-expected integration or environmental remediation costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Occidental has not provided a GAAP measure of financial performance with respect to the disclosure of EBITDA of the acquired business. Such a measure is not available because Occidental is acquiring only a portion of the contracts associated with the business, none of the debt and all of the joint venture.
