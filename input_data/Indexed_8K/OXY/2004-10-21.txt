SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS Item 8.01. Other Events - ---------- ------------ Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced on October 21, 2004 record net income for the third quarter 2004 of $758 million ($1.91 per share), compared with $446 million ($1.16 per share) for the third quarter 2003. Earnings of $1.83 billion ($4.63 per share) for the first nine months of 2004 were 55 percent higher than the $1.15 billion ($2.99 per share) the company earned in the comparable period last year. Core earnings for the first nine months of 2004 were $1.81 billion ($4.60 per share), compared with $1.25 billion ($3.27 per share) for 2003. The debt-to-total capitalization at the end of the third quarter was 29 percent, compared with 37 percent at the end of last year. Interest expense of $187 million for the first nine months of 2004 was 31 percent lower than the comparable 2003 period. Oil and Gas ----------- Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.0 billion for the third quarter 2004, compared with $660 million for the third quarter 2003, an increase of 52 percent. The improvement in the third quarter 2004 earnings reflected higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating costs. Chemicals --------- Chemical segment earnings were $137 million for the third quarter 2004, compared with $61 million for the third quarter 2003, an increase of 125 percent. The improvement in the third quarter 2004 was primarily due to higher sales prices and margins in chlorine, ethylene dichloride, polyvinyl chloride and vinyl chloride monomer, partially offset by higher ethylene and energy costs. Chemical earnings of $272 million for the nine months were almost double that of 2003. See the attached schedules for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the third quarter and nine months. Statements in this release that contain words such as "will" or "expect", or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition.

EXHIBIT 99.1 OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION DR. RAY R. IRANI CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER - CONFERENCE CALL - THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT OCTOBER 21, 2004 Los Angeles, California Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report record third quarter earnings of $758 million, or $1.91 per share, which are up 65 percent over the third quarter of 2003. Our nine months earnings of $1.8 billion, or $4.63 per share, are 55 percent higher than the same period in 2003. Higher oil prices, continued strong natural gas prices, and increased oil production gave us record Oil and Gas segment earnings as well, for both the third quarter and the first nine months. Our nine month oil and gas production was a record 569,000 barrels of oil per day -- up 5 percent from the first nine months of 2003. In the Chemicals business, continuing improvement in commodity chemical prices, along with higher volumes, contributed to our strongest quarterly earnings since the second quarter of 2000. Core chemical earnings for the third quarter were more than twice the earnings in the third quarter of last year. Occidental's overall financial health has never been better. The strong cash flow has enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet. This allows us to continue pursuing business opportunities in our core areas. In 1
that regard, the Dolphin project in the Middle East is moving forward on schedule. And in Libya, our negotiations continue to progress. I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen who will discuss the details of Occidental's record performance. 2
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION STEPHEN CHAZEN SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER - CONFERENCE CALL - THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT OCTOBER 21, 2004 Los Angeles, California Thank you Ray. Occidental's reported and core earnings for the third quarter were $758 million, or $1.91 per share, our best quarterly earnings in history. This compares to $446 million, or $1.16 per share, in the third quarter of last year. Our strong performance was driven by four factors: higher prices; improved chemical earnings; higher production and lower interest expense. For the THIRD QUARTER: o Oil and gas third quarter earnings were a record $1 billion. This was 52 percent higher than the $660 million in earnings during the same period a year ago. o Worldwide oil and gas production was 563,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day - an increase of 3 percent compared with 546,000 barrels we produced in last year's third quarter. o The price of WTI for the quarter averaged $43.87 per barrel compared to $30.20 per barrel in last year's third quarter. Occidental's realized oil price for the quarter was $37.87 per barrel compared to $26.81 per barrel in last year's third quarter. 3
o The chemical segment reported earnings were $137 million - more than double the third quarter 2003 earnings of $61 million. The increase is primarily due to higher sales prices for chlorine, ethylene dichloride, polyvinyl chloride and vinyl chloride monomer, but is partially offset by higher feedstock and energy costs. Increased volumes for chlorine, caustic and polyvinyl chloride also contributed to stronger earnings. o Our net interest expense declined to $59 million for the quarter, including $5 million related to buying back debt. Our net interest expense for the third quarter of 2003 was $71 million. Turning now to Occidental's performance through the FIRST NINE MONTHS: o Core earnings were a record $1.81 billion, or $4.60 per share - 41 percent higher than the $1.25 billion, or $3.27 per share, in the comparable period last year. o Oil and gas earnings were $2.57 billion, which represents a $543 million increase over the first nine months in 2003. o Oil and gas production for the first nine months averaged 569,000 BOE per day, up from 541,000 - or 5 percent - from the same period last year. o WTI averaged $39.11 per barrel compared with $30.98 for the comparable period last year. Occidental's realized oil price was $33.78 per barrel compared to $27.20 per barrel in 2003. September WTI increased $1.06 per barrel compared to August, however, Occidental's realized international oil prices dropped 48 cents per barrel. This change was primarily the result of a 4
significant volume increase in worldwide sour crude sales. This price affects our realizations, especially in Qatar, Oman and Yemen. For example, in Qatar, price differentials through August averaged $5.17 per barrel. In September, that widened to $8.90 per barrel. For 2003, the differential was $3.61. o Oil and Gas operating costs have increased approximately $1.50 per barrel compared to the first nine months of last year. Approximately 35 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices pushing utility, gas plant, ad valorem taxes and carbon dioxide, or CO2, costs up. Higher DD&A rates represented approximately 28 percent of the increase. The remaining cost changes were the result of increased workover, maintenance and other costs. o In chemicals, core earnings were $272 million, which represents a $133 million - or 96 percent - improvement compared to the first nine months of last year. The increase is primarily due to higher sales prices for chlorine, ethylene dichloride, polyvinyl chloride, and vinyl chloride monomer; and higher volumes for chlorine, caustic and polyvinyl chloride. The gains were partially offset by higher feedstock and energy costs. o Our net interest expense for the first nine months declined to $187 million - compared to $270 million for the same period last year. 5
Other Items: o Capital spending was $467 million for the quarter and $1.27 billion for the first nine months. We expect total capital spending for the year to be approximately $1.8 billion - with oil and gas accounting for more than 90 percent of the expenditures. o Cash flow from operations for the nine-month period was $2.7 billion. o At the end of the quarter, stockholders' equity had grown to $9.8 billion, and our debt-to-total capitalization was down to 29 percent, compared to 37 percent at the end of last year. At the end of the quarter, the company had $998 million in cash. As we look ahead in the current quarter: We expect fourth quarter production to be about the same as third quarter production, including our estimates of the impact of the following: o We expect lower October production due to Horn Mountain operations being shut-in because of Hurricane Ivan. Our net production from Horn Mountain is approximately 21,000 BOE per day o Fourth quarter production will be impacted by product prices that affect our production sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and Long Beach. In this product price range for this quarter, each dollar change in the price of oil per barrel changes production by approximately 1,000 barrels per day. 6
In regards to prices: o Each dollar per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas segment fourth quarter earnings by about $29 million before the impact of foreign income taxes. This current impact is lower than in prior quarters due to the September sour crude differential changes that I discussed earlier. o A swing of 10-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $5 million impact on quarterly segment earnings. Our realized domestic gas price in the fourth quarter is expected to be $5.16. Additionally: o Exploration expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $80 million, primarily for drilling in Latin America and the Middle East. o In the chemical business, the demand for chlorine and caustic soda is expected to stay strong. However, the fourth and first quarters are typically the weakest quarters due to seasonal factors. We anticipate fourth quarter feedstock and energy costs to be higher than in the third quarter. Fourth quarter chemical earnings are expected to be about $115 million. o Fourth quarter interest expense is expected to be approximately $53 million. o Our worldwide effective tax rate for the third quarter was 39 percent and we expect the rate for the rest of this year to be about 40 percent. Both our U. S. and foreign tax rates are included in the "Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule". 7
o We record the equity earnings from our investment in Lyondell Chemical Company in corporate "Other". We currently own about 41 million Lyondell shares. We have no way of forecasting the quarterly equity earnings from our Lyondell investment, although the outlook for the business appears to be favorable. Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR system. Now we're ready to take your questions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See the investor relations supplemental schedules for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items.

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CHEMICALS VOLUME (M TONS, EXCEPT PVC RESINS) CHEMICALS PRICES (INDEX) 1987 through 1990 average price = 1.00 CHLORINE - -------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Chlorine operating rates remained strong throughout the 3rd quarter. Unscheduled chlor-alkali outages were the only source of reduced production within the quarter. o As contract terms permitted, OxyChem fully implemented the $20 per ton price increase announced in the 2nd quarter. o OxyChem announced an additional $20 per ton increase to be effective October 1 to most accounts. Other U.S. chlor-alkali producers announced similar increases. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable for the successful implementation of the announced price increase. o Hurricane Ivan and unscheduled outages in the 3rd quarter combined to further tighten the supply/demand balance. 4th quarter operating rates are expected to remain high as the demand for downstream products continues to be strong. 13
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] o Order control programs for chlorine are still in effect and are expected to remain so through the 4th quarter for OxyChem and other U.S. producers. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Avoiding customer shutdowns will remain difficult due to tight chorine supply/demand conditions and scheduled 4th quarter outages. Many large chlorine consumers have been forced to curtail production rates due to lack of chlorine availability. A smaller than expected fall-off in seasonal demand has contributed to the tightening of the supply/demand balance. CAUSTIC - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o 3rd quarter demand for caustic soda remained strong with sales volumes consistent with those of the 2nd quarter. The organic, bleach and alumina market segments contributed significantly to the strength of the 3rd quarter. o The order control programs instituted in the 2nd quarter by OxyChem and other U.S. producers continued throughout the 3rd quarter and are expected to remain through the 4th quarter. o U.S. producers successfully implemented the $95 DST price increase announced in the 2nd quarter. U.S. producers have announced an additional price increase of $110 DST to be implemented in the 4th quarter. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The supply/demand balance for liquid caustic soda continues to lend support for future price improvement in 2004. Continued strength in the U.S. manufacturing sector is expected to keep liquid caustic soda demand in line with high chlorine industry operating rates. EDC - --- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Sky-rocketing ethylene costs in Asia increased 3rd quarter demand for U.S. produced EDC and offset any seasonal pricing pressures. As a result of the increased demand, prices rose rapidly during the quarter. o The accelerating EDC prices narrowed the gap with VCM and PVC that had developed in the first half of 2004. By the middle of the 3rd quarter, prices for EDC and its downstream products VCM and PVC had gained upward momentum. 14
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] o EDC availability to China increased in September when Japan experienced a typhoon that damaged several of their VCM facilities. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The supply/demand balance for EDC in Asia is expected to remain tight. High raw material and energy costs will support continued demand for U.S. produced material. Chlorine availability within the U.S. for EDC production is expected to be limited. PVC/VCM - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Strong domestic PVC demand coupled with a robust export market led to a sold out position in the 3rd quarter. The export demand along with PVC plant outages has contributed to a supply/demand position that is balanced to tight on the domestic side. o Domestic PVC industry operating rates dipped slightly from the 2nd quarter due to outages. VCM and PVC inventories at the producer level declined while PVC levels at pipe producers and distributors remained moderate. o Strong demand from PVC producers, VCM plant outages and low operating rates at Pemex tightened the VCM supply/demand balance. PVC production was interrupted at some producers due to VCM availability. o Both the Westlake Geismar and Shintech Addis facilities remain idle. There is some indication that Westlake will attempt to restart the PVC plant at low rates in November. o Domestic PVC resin prices were flat in July and increased $0.01 per pound in both August and September. An additional increase of $0.01 per pound is expected for November. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Continued strong demand and pricing to the export market is expected through the 4th quarter, providing support for future price improvements throughout the vinyls chain. However, increases in energy and ethylene costs will offset some of the margin improvement gained in the 3rd quarter. 15
