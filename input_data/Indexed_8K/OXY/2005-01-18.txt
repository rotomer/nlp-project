SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement - ---------- ------------------------------------------ On January 13, 2005, Occidental Petroleum Corporation entered into a new employment agreement with Stephen I. Chazen, Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and head of Corporate Development, replacing his prior agreement which would have terminated in October 2005. The new agreement is for a term expiring in January 2010, and provides for an annual salary of not less than $720,000. In addition, the agreement provides that Mr. Chazen will be eligible to participate in all benefit programs as are generally applicable to all salaried employees and senior executives during the term of the agreement. Mr. Chazen may terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days notice. Occidental may discharge Mr. Chazen and terminate the agreement for material cause without severance or other pay upon 30 days' written notice. If Mr. Chazen's employment is terminated as a result of incapacity and he is a participant in and qualifies for benefits under Occidental's Long-Term Disability Plan, Occidental will pay Mr. Chazen the difference between 60 percent of his annual salary and the maximum annual disability benefit, for so long as he remains eligible to receive disability benefits. In the event he is terminated without cause, Mr. Chazen will receive an amount equal to twice the sum of his highest base salary and annual cash bonus target, which amount is payable over a two-year compensation period. During the compensation period, Mr. Chazen will continue to be eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans available to salaried employees and senior executives and to exercise stock options and stock appreciation rights previously granted him that are or become exercisable. Following the compensation period, Mr. Chazen will continue as a consultant to Occidental until January 2010, at an annual salary of $50,000. During the compensation period and any consultancy period, any stock-based awards granted prior to Mr. Chazen's termination will continue to vest in the same manner and in the same amounts as if he continued as a full-time employee.
