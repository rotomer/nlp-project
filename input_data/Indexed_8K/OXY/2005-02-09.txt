SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition - ---------- --------------------------------------------- On February 8, 2005, Occidental Petroleum Corporation released information regarding the revision upward of its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004. The exhibits to this Form 8-K and the information set forth in this Item 2.02 are being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, Results of Operations and Financial Condition. The full text of the press release is attached to this report as Exhibit 99.1. Updated Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are attached to this report as Exhibit 99.2. 1
SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS Item 8.01. Other Events - ---------- ------------ Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced on February 8, 2005 that its fourth quarter net income was $77 million higher ($0.19 per share) than the $665 million ($1.67 per share) the company disclosed on January 24, 2005. The improvement in income is due to an increase in the carrying value of Occidental's investment in Lyondell Chemical Company because of an increase in Lyondell's book value resulting from its November 30, 2004 acquisition of Millennium Chemical Company. There is no cash effect to this non-core earnings item. Lyondell acquired Millennium Chemical Company by issuing additional shares of Lyondell common stock. Under current accounting rules (SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51), Occidental is required to record its share of the increase in Lyondell's net equity resulting from this issuance. The effect of this is an increase of $121 million in the carrying value of Occidental's investment in Lyondell and an increase in Occidental's net income of $77 million after-tax ($0.19 per share). At the time Occidental issued its earnings press release on January 24, Lyondell had not announced its fourth quarter and total-year 2004 results, and a year-end balance sheet was not available until Lyondell released its results on February 3, 2005. In its earnings press release, Occidental stated that earnings from an equity investment were based on a preliminary estimate of their earnings. Also, in its conference call regarding fourth quarter results, Occidental commented that Lyondell had not yet reported its results. Occidental owns 41 million shares of Lyondell common stock. As a result of the Millennium acquisition, Occidental's ownership percentage of Lyondell has decreased from approximately 22 percent to 17 percent. 2

EXHIBIT 99.2 Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CHEMICALS Volume (M Tons, except PVC Resins) CHEMICALS Prices (Index) 1987 through 1990 average price = 1.00 CHLORINE - -------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o As contract terms permitted, OxyChem fully implemented the $20 per ton price increase announced in the 3rd quarter. o OxyChem announced an additional $20 per ton increase to be effective December 1 to most accounts. Other U.S. chlor-alkali producers announced similar increases. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable for the successful implementation of the announced price increase. o 1st quarter operating rates are expected to remain at capacity as the seasonal demand for downstream products improves. o Order control programs for chlorine are still in effect and are expected to remain so through the 1st quarter for OxyChem and other U.S. producers. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The normal seasonal decline in demand has made it easier to avoid customer shutdowns. The availability of spot chlorine indicates a further balancing of supply and 13 Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] demand. However, spot chlorine remains limited and pricing is at or above current contract levels. Increased chlorine consumption into downstream derivatives in the 1st quarter is expected to tighten the supply/demand balance. CAUSTIC - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o Caustic soda sales remained strong in the 4th quarter and consistent with 3rd quarter volumes fueled by demand in the alumina, organic and refining markets. Sales into the bleach market did experience the customary seasonal decline. o OxyChem successfully implemented in the 4th quarter the $110 DST price increase announced in the 3rd quarter. An additional increase of $50 DST was announced November 1st. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable for the successful implementation of the announced price increase in the 1st quarter of 2005. o U.S. Gulf Coast producers settled the alumina pricing for the first half of 2005 at $325 DMT FOB U.S. Gulf Coast. This represents a $211 DMT premium over the second half of 2004 and a $50 DMT premium over that of Asian producers' pricing for the first half of 2005. o Order control programs for liquid caustic soda remained in effect through the 4th quarter and are expected to continue into 2005. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The supply/demand balance projected for the 1st quarter is expected to lend support for future price increases. Continuing improvement in the U.S. manufacturing sector will keep liquid caustic soda demand in line with supply. EDC - --- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o EDC pricing continued in an upward trend through mid-November when PVC pricing moderated in China. o Despite a balanced to tight supply/demand balance, EDC pricing moderated to mid-3rd quarter levels, maintaining the gap between EDC and PVC prices. o Scheduled VCM outages in December coupled with seasonally lower PVC demand in Asia reduced the need for EDC late in the 4th quarter. 14
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules [OXY LOGO] INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- The supply/demand balance for EDC in Asia is expected to tighten late in the 1st quarter after the Chinese New Year period in February. Improved demand for EDC and its downstream vinyl derivatives is also expected to result in increased EDC pricing. Chlorine availability within the U.S. for EDC production will tighten as seasonal demand for chlorine increases. PVC/VCM - ------- OXYCHEM COMMENTARY - ------------------ o OxyChem's 4th quarter operating rate fell to 90% from a 3rd quarter average of 95% due to scheduled 4th quarter outages at three PVC plants. o A strong domestic and export market in the 4th quarter resulted in increased operating rates for PVC and minimal inventory build by producers as they tried to prepare for the seasonal spring surge in demand. o Strong PVC demand and low operating rates at Pemex kept the VCM supply/demand balance tight. PVC production was interrupted at one Latin American producer due to VCM availability. o Westlake has restarted the Geismar VCM and PVC plants at reduced rates. It is expected that the plants will be brought up to a 50% operating rate in 2005. The Shintech Addis facility remains idle and is not expected to restart in 2005. o Domestic PVC resin prices were flat in October, increased $0.01 per pound in November and another $0.02 per pound in December. o PVC resin export prices weakened in December but closed the quarter at $870 - $920 per metric ton CFR Southeast Asia. Normal seasonal decline in PVC demand was experienced in December. o Spot VCM export prices to Latin America closed the 4th quarter at $810 - $820 per metric ton FOB U.S. Gulf Coast. VCM shipments to Asia did not occur due to high freight rates in the range of $200 per metric ton. o Additional price increase for January has been announced for domestic PVC resin of $0.02 per pound. INFLUENCING FACTORS: - -------------------- Favorable domestic demand along with a seasonal rebound in the export market and moderation of energy costs will result in improved margins for the first half of 2005. 15
