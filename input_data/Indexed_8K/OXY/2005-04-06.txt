EXHIBIT INDEX 10.39 Summary of Material Terms and Conditions of Supplemental Retirement Allocations (effective as of January 1, 2005) 99.1 Presentation made by Stephen I. Chazen

EXHIBIT 10.39 Summary of Material Terms and Conditions of Supplemental Retirement Allocations (Effective as of January 1, 2005) Background - As of December 31, 2004, in response to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Creation Act"), no further contribution allocations may be made to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Old SRP"). Until supplemental guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service and a new plan that conforms to such guidance is adopted by the Board of Directors, Occidental Petroleum Corporation will make contingent allocations in a manner that will generally mirror the provisions of the Old SRP, except for necessary or advisable revisions to conform to the new Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 409A. The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions that will govern such allocations: Eligibility - The supplemental retirement allocations will be available to certain higher paid employees of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries in order to compensate them for maximums imposed by law upon contributions to qualified plans. Any employee who was a participant in the Old SRP and whose account in that plan was not fully vested on December 31, 2004 shall have a supplemental retirement allocations account established on January 1, 2005. The nonvested account of such a participant shall be transferred to the supplemental retirement allocations account maintained for the participant as of January 1, 2005. Allocations - Allocations related to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Retirement Plan (PRA) will be based on the Social Security wage base, and an eligible employee's age and pay. A contingent credit will be made to supplemental retirement allocations and will be adjusted based on an eligible employee's pay and the annual additions and elective deferral limits imposed by Code Sections 415 and 402(g). For this purpose, it is assumed that the employee has made the maximum elective deferrals and/or after-tax contributions permitted to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Savings Plan (PSA). Allocations related to the PSA are based on the compensation limits imposed by Code Section 401(a)(17) and an eligible employee's pay. Allocations relating to the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan will be based on an eligible employee's age and bonus. An eligible employee's account also reflects interest credits. Vesting - All benefits under supplemental retirement allocations are contingent and forfeitable and no participant shall have a vested interest in any benefit unless, while he is still employed, a participant becomes fully vested in his benefit under the PRA. Distributions - A participant's vested supplemental retirement allocations account may not be distributed earlier than a participant's separation from service or death. If a participant is a key employee, a distribution made on account of separation from service
may not be made before a date that is at least six months after the participant's separation from service. If a participant fails to make a valid and timely election, any vested account maintained for the participant shall be paid as a single sum as soon as administratively practicable. In addition, notwithstanding any election made by the participant, if the balance of any vested account maintained for the participant is less than $50,000 when the amount first becomes payable, the balance shall be paid in a single sum as soon as administratively practicable. Annual installment payments over 5, 10, 15, or 20 years are available. No change in distribution election shall be permitted which accelerates the time of any payment. Any change in election resulting in a delay or change in the form of payment shall not take effect until the one-year anniversary of the date the changed election is properly made. In the case of a payment on account of the participant's separation from service, the first payment under the changed election must result in a deferral for a period of at least 5 years from the date the first payment would have been made under the initial election.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION [OXY LOGO] Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will", "expect" or "estimate", or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use certain terms in this presentation, such as probable, possible and recoverable reserves, that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from using in filings with the SEC. Additionally, the SEC requires oil and natural gas companies, in their filings, to disclose non-financial statistical information about their consolidated entities separately from such information about their equity holdings and not to show combined totals. Certain information in this presentation is shown on a combined basis; however, the information is disclosed separately in the Appendix. U.S. investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in our Form 10-K, available through the following toll-free telephone number, 1-888-OXYPETE (1-888-699-7383) or on the Internet at http://www.oxy.com.
