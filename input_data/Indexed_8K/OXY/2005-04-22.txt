SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement - ---------- ------------------------------------------ Beginning with 2005 and for the years ended 2005, 2006 and 2007, Occidental's prospective three-year average burn rate with respect to the company's equity awards will not exceed the greater of two percent of the company's shares outstanding or the mean of its Global Industry Classification Standards Peer Group (1010 Energy). This policy will apply to shares issued pursuant to the 1996 Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the 2001 Incentive Compensation Plan and the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The burn rate will be calculated as (i) the number of shares granted in each fiscal year by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of Occidental's Board of Directors and reported in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including (a) stock options, (b) stock-settled stock appreciation rights, (c) restricted stock (units), (d) performance shares actually earned and delivered or deferred, to employees and directors divided by (ii) the fiscal year end basic shares outstanding. Stock appreciation rights or full value shares settled in cash will not be included in the calculation of burn rate. For the purpose of the calculation, one full value share equals four option shares. 1
