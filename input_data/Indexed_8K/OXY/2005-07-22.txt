Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On July 22, 2005, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the second quarter 2005 of $1.536 billion ($3.82 per share), compared with $581 million ($1.48 per share) for the second quarter 2004. Included in the second quarter 2005 net income are the benefits of two previously announced transactions - a $619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues and an $89 million after-tax gain from the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Company. Core earnings for the second quarter were $851 million ($2.12 per share), compared with $584 million
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.325 billion for the second quarter 2005, compared with $980 million for the second quarter 2004. After adjusting for a $26 million charge related to a contract settlement, core earnings were $1.351 billion for the second quarter 2005. The improvement in the second quarter 2005 earnings reflected higher worldwide crude oil and gas prices, partially offset by higher operating and exploration expenses and increased DD&A rates. Exploration expenses were higher primarily as a result of a $66 million property impairment resulting from an unsuccessful deep gas well at Elk Hills.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical segment and core earnings were $225 million for the second quarter 2005, compared with $92 million for the second quarter 2004. The improvement in the second quarter 2005 results was due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride resulting from higher sales prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs.
 
Other Items
 
The tax benefit recorded in the second quarter was the result of a closing agreement with the IRS, which resolved certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the IRS audit of tax years 1997-2000. As a result, Occidental reversed tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues. This resolution did not have a significant current cash effect.
 
After the sale of 11 million shares, Occidental still owns 30.3 million Lyondell shares and warrants to purchase an additional 5 million shares. Occidental accounts for its Lyondell investment on the equity basis.
 
Six-Months Results
 
For the first six months of 2005, net income was $2.382 billion ($5.94 per share), compared with $1.068 billion ($2.72 per share) for the first six months of 2004.
 
Core earnings were $1.717 billion for 2005, compared with $1.060 billion for 2004. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
 
Worldwide production for the first six months of 2005 was 560,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 571,000 barrels for the first six months of 2004. Horn Mountain's production for the first six months of 2005 was 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent, compared to 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent in 2004, primarily as a result of weather in the Gulf of Mexico and maintenance downtime. Compared to a year ago, production under the company's production-sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and Long Beach was negatively impacted by higher prices. If prices had remained at the six months 2004

levels, production in the first six months of 2005 would have been about 15,000
equivalent barrels per day higher.
 
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, global commodity pricing fluctuations, and supply/demand consideration for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
 
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For Immediate Release: July 22, 2005
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS
LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income for the second quarter 2005 of $1.536 billion ($3.82 per share), compared with $581 million ($1.48 per share) for the second quarter 2004. Included in the second quarter 2005 net income are the benefits of two previously announced transactions - a $619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues and an $89 million after-tax gain from the sale of 11 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Company. Core earnings for the second quarter were $851 million ($2.12 per share), compared with $584 million ($1.49 per share) for the same period in 2004.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Robust energy prices and strong chemical margins were key factors in our financial performance that drove our core earnings 46 percent higher than last year's second quarter and contributed to the strongest earnings for any six-month period in Oxy's history. We also were successful in setting the stage for future growth by concluding a new production-sharing contract to develop Oman's giant Mukhaizna oil field, reaching an agreement to resume operations in our historic contract areas in Libya and acquiring oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin of Texas."
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.325 billion for the second quarter 2005, compared with $980 million for the second quarter 2004. After adjusting for a $26 million charge related to a contract settlement, core earnings were $1.351 billion for the second quarter 2005. The improvement in the second quarter
 
 
 
2005 earnings reflected higher worldwide crude oil and gas prices, partially offset by higher operating and exploration
expenses and increased DD&A rates. Exploration expenses were higher primarily as a result of a $66 million property impairment resulting from an unsuccessful deep gas well at Elk Hills.
Chemicals
Chemical segment and core earnings were $225 million for the second quarter 2005, compared with $92 million for the second quarter 2004. The improvement in the second quarter 2005 results was due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride resulting from higher sales prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Announcement
 
July 22, 2005
Los Angeles, California
 
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report that our strong second quarter results pushed both our reported and core earnings for six months to record high levels. Steve Chazen will discuss our financial results in detail shortly, but first, I'd like to mention several milestones we passed during the quarter.
Anyone who has been following Oxy closely over the past four years knows that debt reduction has been one of the focal points of our business plan. During the quarter, Oxy's long-term corporate debt received straight As from Fitch, Moody's and S&P. This is the first time in the company's history that our debt has been A-rated.
In addition, we concluded two agreements that we expect will play important roles in Oxy's future growth. I'm pleased to announce that we have reached agreement with the Libyan National Oil Company to resume operation of Oxy's historical oil assets. We expect formal approval from the Libyan Government in the very near term. The immediate impact will be to add about 12,000 to 15,000 barrels of oil per day to the 2005 exit rate. Preparations also are proceeding for the work program in the exploration blocks we were awarded earlier this year. We plan to begin collecting
 
 
seismic data in the near future, and we expect to begin exploratory drilling early next year.
In Oman, we have finalized a contract to develop the giant Mukhaizna oil field. The Sultanate of Oman issued the Royal Decree last week, which opens the door for Oxy to begin aggressive development of the field. Under the terms of a new Production Sharing Contract, Occidental is the operator of the field and holds a 45 percent interest. Our partner, Liwa Energy, which is owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi, has a 15 percent stake. The other stakeholders include the state-owned Oman Oil Company with 20 percent, Shell with 17 percent, Total with 2 percent and Partex, with 1 percent.
As we previously announced, Oxy and its partners expect to invest more than $2 billion in enhanced oil recovery projects to increase production from the field's current rate of about 10,000 barrels per day to about 150,000 barrels per day within the next few years. Our plan calls for the recovery of approximately 1 billion barrels of oil over the 30-year life of this project. This is an exciting opportunity for us to build on our existing operations in Oman to add significant future value for our stockholders.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Announcement
 
July 22, 2005
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the second quarter was $1.54 billion, or $3.82 per share, compared to $581 million, or $1.48 per share, in the second quarter of 2004. The net income was improved by a $619 million tax benefit resulting from the settlement with the IRS we announced on May 10th. Additionally, it was impacted by higher oil and gas prices, higher chemical margins and an after-tax gain of $89 million from the May sale of 11 million Lyondell shares. The improvements were offset by a $26 million settlement of a contract, and a $66 million impairment of oil and gas acreage.
The IRS settlement resolved certain foreign tax credit issues as part of an IRS audit of tax years 1997 through 2000. As a result, Oxy reversed tax reserves that were previously established for these foreign tax credit issues. The agreement did not have a significant current cash effect.
Core earnings, which exclude the IRS agreement, the sale of the Lyondell shares and the contract settlement, were $851 million, or $2.12 per share, for the quarter, and $1.7 billion, or $4.28 per share, for the first six months. This compares to $584 million and $1.1 billion for the respective periods last year.

Oil and gas segment core earnings for the quarter were $1.35 billion, compared to $980 million for the second quarter of 2004.
 
4
 
 
half of the year, WTI averaged $51.51 per barrel, compared with $36.73 in 2004.
     Chemical core earnings for the quarter were $225 million, up from $92 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to higher margins for chlorine, caustic soda and PVC resins. Price increases were partially offset by higher feedstock and energy costs. Chemical core earnings for the first six months were $439 million, up from $148 million in the comparable period last year.
 
5
 
 
 
Oxy's debt-to-cap was down to 21 percent, compared with 27 percent at the end of 2004. In the first half, cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion. At the end of June, Oxy had about $870 million in cash. For the first half, Oxy's annualized return on equity was 41 percent and our annualized return on capital employed was 32 percent.
Net interest expense was $46 million for the quarter, and $97 million for the first six months. The worldwide effective tax rate for the second quarter was 42 percent. This was up slightly from Oxy's forecast of 41 percent due to higher than expected foreign income, which has a higher tax rate than U.S. income.
The sale of Lyondell shares reduced Oxy's ownership to 30.3 million shares. In addition, Oxy has warrants to purchase 5 million shares. Oxy's second quarter 2005 net income per share was 5 cents lower than the first quarter, as a result of the equity income from fewer shares and the change in value of the warrants.
Capital spending was $518 million for the quarter, and $1.05 billion for the first six months. We expect capital spending for the year to be $2.3 billion.
As we look ahead in the third quarter:

adopting this statement will be immaterial. We disclosed in our first quarter 10-Q, that if we had adopted SFAS 123(R) at the beginning of 2005, the impact on first quarter EPS would have been less than a penny per share.

OxyChem Commentary
 
 
13
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules
 
 
 
Influencing Factors:
Inventory reductions in the vinyls chain coupled with cooler, wet weather throughout most of the East and Midwest dampened domestic chlorine demand in the 2 quarter. Although this lessened concerns over chlorine availability, several prolonged outages within the industry kept the supply/demand balance stable, thus preventing the threat of price erosion. Chlorine demand into the vinyls chain is expected to improve in the 3 quarter.
nd

CAUSTIC
OxyChem Commentary
 
 
 
Influencing Factors:
Caustic soda demand is anticipated to remain robust in the 3quarter as seasonal demand into bleach peaks and the U.S. manufacturing sector shows continued signs of strength. As a result, market conditions are expected to remain favorable for future price improvement. However, the strength of the U.S. manufacturing sector and/or unseasonably cool temperatures throughout the U.S. could impact demand and future price improvement.

EDC
OxyChem Commentary
 
 
14
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules
 
 
 
Influencing Factors:
Prices for EDC in the Far East have stabilized after significant declines in the 2 quarter. EDC prices are expected to rebound as VCM and PVC pricing improves. Continued VCM outages in Asia have unfavorably impacted the supply/demand balance for EDC. Spot export shipments are expected to be limited out of the U.S. in the 3 quarter due to lower chlorine values versus other alternatives.
nd
rd
 
OxyChem Commentary
 
Influencing Factors:
Increased seasonal domestic demand will result in some margin improvement for VCM and PVC in the 3quarter. Inventory reductions, moderate demand and increased energy costs will support continued export price stability with some rebound expected.
