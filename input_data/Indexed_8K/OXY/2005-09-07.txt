Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will", "expect" or "estimate", or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results.  Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:  changes in tax rate, exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition.  Occidental disclaims any obligation to update any forward- looking statements.  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use certain terms in this presentation, such as probable, possible and recoverable reserves, that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from using in filings with the SEC.   Additionally, the SEC requires oil and natural gas companies, in their filings, to disclose non-financial statistical information about their consolidated entities separately from such information about their equity holdings and not to show combined totals.  Certain information in this presentation is shown on a combined basis; however, the information is disclosed separately in the Appendix.
  
U.S. investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in our Form 10-K, available through the following toll-free telephone number,
1-888-OXYPETE (1-888-699-7383)
or on the Internet at
