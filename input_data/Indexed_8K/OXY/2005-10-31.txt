Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On October 31, 2005, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the third quarter 2005 of $1.747 billion ($4.32 per share), compared with $758 million ($1.91 per share) for the third quarter 2004. Included in the third quarter 2005 net income are the effects of three significant items  a $463 million after-tax gain resulting from Valero's acquisition of Premcor, a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $98 million after-tax charge from the write-off of certain chemical plants. Core earnings for the third quarter were $1.089 billion ($2.69 per share), compared with $759 million ($1.92 per share) for the same period in 2004.
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.760 billion for the third quarter 2005, compared with $1.216 billion for the third quarter 2004, an increase of approximately 45 percent. The third quarter 2005 included a $9 million insurance premium increase related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. After adjusting for the impact of this increase, core earnings were $1.769 billion for the quarter. The improvement in the third quarter 2005 core earnings included $692 million from higher worldwide crude oil and gas prices, partially offset by higher operating, exploration, and other costs and increased DD&A rates.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical segment earnings were $3 million for the third quarter 2005, compared with $141 million for the third quarter 2004. The third quarter 2005 included a $139 million charge for the write-off of two previously idled plants and one currently operated plant, a charge of $20 million for the write-down of a plant and a $5 million charge due to higher insurance premiums directly related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. After adjusting for the $164 million pre-tax charges, core earnings were $167 million for the third quarter 2005, compared with $141 million for last year's third quarter.
 
The improvement in the third quarter 2005 core earnings was primarily due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride resulting from higher sales prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs. Volumes were reduced and feedstock costs increased as a result of the hurricanes.
 
Other Items
 
The $335 million tax benefit recorded in the third quarter 2005 is due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as U.S. federal corporate returns for tax years 1998-2000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations.
 
 
A $726 million pre-tax gain resulting from Valero's acquisition of Premcor and our subsequent sale of 89 percent of the Valero shares received was recorded in the third quarter 2005. Occidental tendered its 9 million shares of Premcor for cash and shares of Valero Energy Corporation stock pursuant to the Premcor-Valero merger agreement.
 
Nine-Months Results
 
For the first nine months of 2005, net income was $4.129 billion ($10.26 per share), compared with $1.826 billion ($4.63 per share) for the first nine months of 2004.
 
Core income was $2.806 billion for 2005, compared with $1.819 billion for 2004. See the attached schedules for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the third quarter and nine months.
 
Worldwide production for the first nine months of 2005 was 561,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 569,000 barrels for the first nine months of 2004. Horn Mountain's production for the first nine months of 2005 was 14,500 barrels of oil equivalent, compared to 24,500 barrels of oil equivalent in 2004, primarily as a result of weather in the Gulf of Mexico and scheduled maintenance downtime. Compared to a year ago, production under the company's production-sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and Long Beach was negatively impacted by higher prices. If prices had remained at the nine months 2004 levels, production in the first nine months of 2005 would have been about 13,000 equivalent barrels per day higher. The nine months of 2005 included production of 13,000 equivalent barrels per day from the recent Permian acquisitions and the first lifting from Libya of 3,000 barrels per day.
 
Additional Information and Where to Find It
 
Occidental will file a Form S-4, Vintage will file a proxy statement and both companies will file other relevant documents concerning the proposed merger transaction with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Forward-Looking Statements
 
The matters set forth in the press release, including statements as to the expected benefits of the Vintage acquisition such as material growth in Occidental's core areas, and other statements identified by such words as "will," "estimates," "expects," "hopes," "projects," "plans," and similar expressions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results, including a delay in or failure to obtain required approvals, the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the acquisition cannot be fully realized, the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration will be greater than expected, the ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, and the impact of competition. Other risk factors that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements in the press release include, but are not limited to: changes in tax rates, exploration risks, global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply and demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals and higher than expected costs. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the press release. Unless legally required, Occidental undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
 
The SEC limits the ability of oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose reserves other than proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use certain terms in the press release, such as probable, possible and recoverable reserves, that the SEC's guidelines limit in filings with the SEC.
 
Information contained in the press release regarding Vintage's production, reserves, results, assets and other information has been taken from Vintage's public filings with the SEC. Occidental makes no representation with respect to the accuracy of this information.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
 
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The following tables set forth the core earnings and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate:

For Immediate Release: October 31, 2005
 
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM ANNOUNCES RECORD THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
 
LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) announced net income for the third quarter 2005 of $1.747 billion ($4.32 per share), compared with $758 million ($1.91 per share) for the third quarter 2004. Included in the third quarter 2005 net income are the effects of three significant items  a $463 million after-tax gain resulting from Valero's acquisition of Premcor, a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $98 million after-tax charge from the write-off of certain chemical plants. Core earnings for the third quarter were $1.089 billion ($2.69 per share), compared with $759 million ($1.92 per share) for the same period in 2004.
 
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "In the current commodity price environment we continue to strengthen our operational and financial fundamentals, as well as enhance our potential for above-average production growth. In July, Oxy became the first U.S. oil company to resume oil producing operations in Libya, and the government of Oman approved a contract for Oxy to develop the Mukhaizna oil field, one of the largest oil fields in the country. We began operating Mukhaizna on September 1. We also had our first lifting of Libyan crude oil in late September. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Vintage Petroleum, which is the latest in a series of strategic transactions aimed at strengthening the company's prospects for material growth in its core areas in California, the Middle East and Latin America. We also announced a 16-percent increase in the dividend rate and the
 
 
 
planned repurchase of 9 million Oxy shares. All of our actions are driven by a disciplined strategy, built around the objective of producing superior total returns for our stockholders by balancing near term profitability with sustainable long-term growth."

 Conference Call 
Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Announcement
 
October 31, 2005
Los Angeles, California
 
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
High commodity prices, supported by strong oil and gas industry fundamentals, have been key contributors to another record quarter for Oxy and the best nine months in our history Steve Chazen will discuss our financial results in detail shortly. But first, I'd like to focus briefly on the steps we've taken recently to enhance both our near term financial and operational performance and our potential for above average long term production growth.
On September 1st, we replaced Royal Dutch Shell as the operator of the Mukhaizna oil field in Oman As we announced earlier this year, we and our partners plan to invest in excess of $2 billion to implement a large-scale steam flood to increase gross production from the current level of about 10,000 barrels per day to approximately 150,000 barrels per day within the next few years. Current plans call for the recovery of approximately one billion barrels over the life of the project.
In late September, we lifted our first cargo of Libyan crude oil since returning to our historic contract areas after an absence of nearly twenty years. According to our current estimate, we expect our Libyan operations will account for approximately 22,000 barrels per day of Oxy's year-end
 
 
2005 production exit rate. That's 7,000 to 10,000 barrels per day higher than our initial estimates.
Since we were awarded nine blocks during Libya's first bid round last January, we have been conducting technical evaluations of our holdings. We expect to begin shooting seismic in the next couple of weeks and anticipate drilling our first exploration well in mid-2006.
I should also point out that work is proceeding on schedule for the massive Dolphin gas project, with first gas expected at the end of 2006. We expect this project to achieve gross production of approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day in 2007.
Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Vintage Petroleum for a combination of cash and Oxy stock valued at approximately $3.8 billion. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of focusing on oil and gas assets with growth potential located in our three core geographic areas of the U.S., Latin America and the Middle East. In addition, these assets are a good operational fit with our technical experience of enhancing oil and gas recovery from fields already in production.
In announcing the Vintage acquisition, we also announced our intent to repurchase 9 million Oxy shares.
As you know, our business strategy also calls for maintaining a strong balance sheet. During the year, we have paid off $890 million of debt, bringing our debt to capitalization ratio down to the teens. In announcing the Vintage acquisition and share repurchase program, we said we would finance these transactions from cash on hand at the end of the third quarter, plus cash we expect to generate in the current quarter. Following the announcement, the four major rating agencies reaffirmed Oxy's "Single A" rating.
 
2
 
 
Earlier this month we also announced a 16 percent dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend to 36-cents per share, for an annual rate of $1.44 per share. That's the fourth time since 2002 that we have increased the dividend. The board of directors evaluates the dividend policy annually as part of our commitment to enhance total returns to our stockholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Announcement
 
October 31, 2005
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the third quarter was $1.747 billion, or $4.32 per share. This is more than double the $758 million, or $1.91 per share, we earned in last year's third quarter. This year's results were affected by a $463 million after tax gain resulting from Valero's acquisition of Premcor, a $335 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves and a $98 million after tax write-off of chemical plants. Our Premcor stock had an average cost of $10.75 per share. The Valero acquisition had a cash and stock value of almost $89 per share. Included in the above is a realized pre-tax gain of $22 million from the sale of all but 500,000 shares received from Valero.
Core earnings, which exclude the impact of the sale of Premcor shares, the tax reversal, the chemicals write down and other hurricane-related and debt charges, were $1.089 billion, or $2.69 per share. This compares favorably to the $759 million, or $1.92 per share, we earned in the same period last year. Our strong performance was driven by three items - higher energy prices, improved chemical earnings and lower interest expense.

Influencing Factors:
While there is still uncertainty with respect to chlorine demand, chlorine supply/demand is expected to remain balanced in the 4 quarter. Vinyls production and the resulting chlorine consumption are expected to be constrained by ethylene availability. Lost chlorinated derivative production in the 3 quarter is projected to boost chlorine demand for the remainder of the year. However, noticeable improvements in demand associated with the rebuilding along the Gulf Coast is not expected until the 1 half of 2006.

CAUSTIC
OxyChem Commentary
 
Influencing Factors:
Significant operating issues are expected to support 4 quarter price improvement as the supply of liquid caustic soda remains tight. Several chlor-alkali facilities are currently running at reduced rates or have not yet resumed production. While seasonal demand for liquid caustic soda will decline, the tight supply projected in the 4 quarter will lend support for future price improvement.

EDC

Influencing Factors:
Prices for EDC in the Far East have stabilized after significant declines in the 2 quarter but have not rebounded with 3 quarter price increases in VCM and PVC. Continued VCM outages and capacity increases in acetylene based production have unfavorably impacted the supply/demand balance for EDC. High ethylene costs and low EDC prices will limit spot export volumes out of the U.S. in the 4 quarter.

Influencing Factors:
Increased seasonal domestic demand coupled with the supply issues created by the hurricanes will continue to tighten the vinyls supply/demand balance. Additional price increases may be necessary in the 4 quarter to offset the high feedstock costs and to enable margin improvement for both VCM and PVC.
