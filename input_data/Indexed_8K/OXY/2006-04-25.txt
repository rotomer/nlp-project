Section 8  Other Events
 
  
Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On April 25, 2006, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the first quarter 2006 of $1.23 billion ($2.90 basic per share), compared with $846 million ($2.11 basic per share) for the first quarter 2005. Diluted earnings were $2.86 per share for the first quarter 2006, compared with $2.08 per share for the first quarter 2005.
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were a record $2.0 billion for the first quarter 2006, which was a 48 percent increase from the $1.35 billion in earnings for the first quarter 2005. The first quarter 2006 earnings reflected a $700 million improvement from the impact of higher energy prices and $198 million increase from higher production, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates.
For the quarter, oil and gas daily production averaged a record high 636,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), which was a 13 percent increase over the 565,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the first quarter 2005. The increase included two months of Vintage production at 57,000 BOE per day which added 38,000 BOE per day to Occidental's quarterly production, Libya production of 22,000 BOE per day that came on line in the third quarter of 2005, and 25,000 BOE per day from Permian acquisitions that were acquired in the second quarter of 2005. Compared to a year ago, production under the Company's production sharing contracts in Oman, Qatar, Yemen and Long Beach was negatively impacted by higher prices. The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the first quarter 2006 was $63.48 per barrel compared to $49.84 per barrel in the first quarter 2005. If prices had remained at first quarter 2005 levels, production in the first quarter 2006 would have been 8,000 equivalent barrels per day higher.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical segment earnings were $248 million for the first quarter 2006, compared with $214 million for the first quarter 2005. The improvement was due to increased volumes in chlor-alkali and higher margins in chlor-alkali and polyvinyl chloride, resulting from higher sales prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs.
 
Core Earnings
 
Core earnings for the first quarter 2006 were $1.22 billion ($2.87 basic per share), compared with $866 million ($2.16 basic per share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the first quarter.
 
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, global commodity pricing fluctuations, changes in tax rates, and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this presentation. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Occidental's results of operation often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For Immediate Release: April 25, 2006
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2006 RESULTS
LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income for the first quarter 2006 of $1.23 billion ($2.90 basic per share), compared with $846 million ($2.11 basic per share) for the first quarter 2005. Diluted earnings were $2.86 per share for the first quarter 2006, compared with $2.08 per share for the first quarter 2005.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The first quarter daily production was 636,000 barrels of oil equivalent, the highest quarterly production in Oxy's history. This was an increase of 13 percent over the first quarter of 2005. We expect production for the second quarter to be approximately 650,000 BOE, which would be another record. First quarter core earnings of $1.22 billion set a new record surpassing the previous record set in the last quarter of 2005."
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were a record $2.0 billion for the first quarter 2006, which was a 48 percent increase from the $1.35 billion in earnings for the first quarter 2005. The first quarter 2006 earnings reflected a $700 million improvement from the impact of higher energy prices and $198 million increase from higher production, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates.
For the quarter, oil and gas daily production averaged a record high 636,000 barrels of oil equivalent(BOE), which was a 13 percent increase over the 565,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the first quarter 2005. The increase included two months of Vintage production at 57,000 BOE per day which added 38,000 BOE per day to Occidental's quarterly production, Libya production of 22,000 BOE per day that came on line in the third quarter of 2005, and 25,000 BOE per day from Permian acquisitions that were acquired in the second quarter of 2005.

If prices had remained at first quarter 2005 levels, production in the first quarter 2006 would have been 8,000 equivalent barrels per day higher.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings were $248 million for the first quarter 2006, compared with $214 million for the first quarter 2005. The improvement was due to increased volumes in chlor-alkali and higher margins in chlor-alkali and polyvinyl chloride, resulting from higher sales prices, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock costs.
Core Earnings
Core earnings for the first quarter 2006 were $1.22 billion ($2.87 basic per share), compared with $866 million ($2.16 basic per share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings for the first quarter.

 Conference Call 
First Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
 
April 25, 2006
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you, Ken.
Net income for the quarter was $1.23 billion, or $2.90 per share, compared to $846 million, or $2.11 per share in the first quarter of 2005. First quarter core income of $1.22 billion was the third quarter in a row of new core income records. The improvement in our performance was driven by higher energy prices, higher oil and gas volumes and improved chemical earnings. First quarter oil and gas production increased to a record of 636,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Occidental closed on the purchase of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. on January 30, 2006, which contributed to the production increase.
On a segment basis, oil and gas first quarter earnings were $2.00 billion, compared to $1.35 billion for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 48 percent. The following factors accounted for the change in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
 
 
Oil and gas operating costs were $10.22 a barrel which compares to $8.71 last year. Approximately 60 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices pushing up utility, gas plant, ad valorem and export taxes, CO costs, and the impact of higher energy prices on our production sharing contracts. Argentina export taxes represent 26 cents of this increase. The remaining cost changes were the result of workover, maintenance and other costs.
2
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter 2006 were $248 million compared to $214 million in the first quarter of 2005.

The primary factors that accounted for the improvement in our first quarter 2006 chemical earnings compared to the 2005 first quarter were stronger prices resulting in higher margins for our core chlor-vinyl business, particularly for caustic soda and PVC. This is better than our prior outlook for the quarter due to lower than expected natural gas and ethylene costs.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was approximately $2.0 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2005.
Interest expense was $29 million during the first quarter 2006, compared to $61 million in the 2005 first quarter. Last year's first quarter interest expense included debt repayment fees of $10 million.
Turning to the first quarter 2006 balance sheet, we increased shareholder equity to $17.9 billion, or $2.9 billion higher than the year-end 2005 level. Even with this increase, Oxy's annualized return on equity was 30 percent, with an annualized return on capital employed of 25 percent. Total debt increased $609 million to $3.628 billion during the first quarter as a result of the Vintage acquisition. We have reclassified $209 million of Vintage debt as current, which will be redeemed on May 15. We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash in hand, having begun the quarter at $2.4 billion. During the first quarter, Occidental repurchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $91.79 per share, 2.3 million of these shares were purchased after the February 23 investors meeting. We issued 28 million shares of Occidental common stock for the purchase of Vintage. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first quarter were 424.2 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 430.5 million. At March 31, there were 432.0 million basic shares outstanding and the fully dilutive share amount was approximately 438.2 million.

Capital spending for the quarter was $605 million. Oil and gas accounted for 94 percent of the total.
As we look ahead in the current quarter:

Influencing Factors:
All operating issues related to the 2005 hurricanes have been corrected for chlorine producers and consumers. Chlorine demand has improved moving into the 2 quarter with the expectation that the supply/demand balance will tighten in the 2 and 3 quarters. Gulf Coast rebuilding should begin to have a positive impact on chlorine demand starting in the 2 quarter, further tightening the supply/demand balance.

CAUSTIC
OxyChem Commentary
 
Influencing Factors:
Demand for liquid caustic soda is expected to improve in the 2 quarter narrowing the supply/demand balance. As a result, pricing is expected to stabilize in the 2 quarter. However, unseasonably cool weather, increased imports or unfavorable changes in the U.S. manufacturing sector could impact the supply/demand balance and exert some pressure on 2 quarter pricing.

EDC
OxyChem Commentary

Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules
 
 
 
Influencing Factors:
Demand for U.S. EDC exports will remain limited. Small fluctuations may be seen in EDC price but significant gains are not expected as PVC demand in Asia is not strong enough to overcome the economic advantage of calcium carbide based VCM production.
 
PVC/VCM
OxyChem Commentary
 
 
13
Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules
 
 
Influencing Factors:
PVC demand was seasonally slow in the 1st quarter. It is believed that the lackluster demand is a result of anticipated lower domestic PVC pricing due to sharp declines in feedstock costs. Vinyls demand is expected to improve in the 2nd quarter as the spring construction season begins. Dow's permanent closure of the Fort Saskatchewan VCM facility is expected to tighten the VCM supply/demand balance in the Americas.
