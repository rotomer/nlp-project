EXHIBIT 99.1
By almost every measure, 2005 was an excellent year for Oxy. For the next few minutes, I want to review the highlights that made 2005 the best year in Oxy's history and give a preview of the steps we're taking to enhance future shareholder value.

2005 was a year of record achievements.
Record oil and gas operating income and strong operating income from our chemicals business pushed our consolidated net income to an historic high of $5.3 billion.
Cash flow from operations also hit an all-time high of $5.3 billion.
This is the third consecutive year in which net income and operating cash flow reached new highs.
We ended the year with the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. Total debt was reduced to $3 billion, and stockholders' equity rose to a record $15 billion.
Worldwide oil and gas production of more than 207 million barrels of oil equivalent was higher than our previous record set in 2004.
Last year we replaced 191 percent of our production and ended the year with proved reserves at a record high level of over 2.7 billion equivalent barrels.

Oxy also has led the industry for seven straight years in cash flow per barrel. Oxy's cash flow of $16.40 per barrel was more than double the industry average of $7.69.
Our ability to generate top quartile cash flow per barrel gives us the flexibility and financial leverage to compete successfully for new high potential investment opportunities.

Oxy's net income in 2005, as shown in the green columns, was five times higher than in 2001. As our income grew by a factor of 5, the gold bars show that the average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil had little more than doubled.
While higher oil prices helped increase profits during the past five years, other factors such as production growth and a disciplined financial strategy have kept our net income climbing at a much faster pace than rising oil prices.

As our net income and cash flow were rising, we also made steady progress in reducing debt. As you can see here, Oxy's total debt declined from more than $6 billion at the end of 2000 to $3 billion at the end of 2005.
Moreover, we ended 2005 with approximately $2.4 billion of cash on hand which means that our debt net of the cash was only $578 million.
The strength of our balance sheet led all four major rating agencies to raise our credit rating to "A".
As we look to the future, our strong balance sheet will enable us to compete successfully for large international growth projects.

We focus on generating consistently high returns on equity because this drives superior shareholder returns.
As this chart shows, Oxy's three-year average return on equity of 31 percent ranked in the top quartile among our oil and gas competitors for the period from 2003 through 2005.

From your standpoint as investors, the most important performance indicator is the total return to shareholders.
All the oil companies have benefited from higher prices, but Oxy's total return of 279 percent, like our profits and cash flow per barrel, has led the industry over the past five years.

This chart compares Oxy's cumulative total return with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and our Proxy peer group.
The peer group includes Amerada Hess, Anadarko, Apache, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, ExxonMobil, Kerr-McGee and Occidental.
If you invested $100 in Oxy stock at yearend 2000, the value of your investment would have grown to $379 by the end of 2005.
By comparison, your $100 investment in the composite peer group would have yielded $229 over the same five-year period. That's $150 less than the value of your comparable Oxy investment.
If you had invested $100 in the S&P Index, your investment would have been worth only $103 after five years.
As we have said repeatedly, our primary focus is on generating superior total returns for our shareholders relative to our competitors. We trust you are pleased with the results.
Our job is to keep the value of your Oxy investment growing  subject, of course, to market conditions.

On behalf of the board, the management team and our employees, I want to thank all our shareholders, and especially our long-term shareholders, for their loyalty.
While the views of all our shareholders are important to us, we are engaged in regular dialogue with our large shareholders. Let me give you a breakdown of our shareholders.
Our 10 largest shareholders own more than 144 million shares that account for one-third of Oxy's total shares. There are 52 institutional shareholders, who own between 1 and 9 million shares, that account for over 123 million shares, or about 29 percent. That means that 62 institutions own nearly two-thirds of our shares.
In addition, other large institutions hold an additional 77 million shares, or 18 percent, giving our institutional shareholders control of more than 80 percent of our stock.
I would now like to review some of last year's highlights that helped set the stage for Oxy's continued growth.
12
 
2005 Highlights  Texas & New Mexico
We enhanced our industry-leading position in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico through a series of acquisitions. These acquisitions have further strengthened Oxy's dominant position in this important producing area. Our Permian operations are the largest in our worldwide portfolio of assets. We expect our total Permian production from Texas and New Mexico to average approximately 200,000 equivalent barrels per day this year.

As you can see, Oxy is by far the largest oil producer in Texas, with production three times greater than Chevron which is the next largest producer. Our size and infrastructure place us in an excellent position to play the role of regional consolidator.
14
 
2005 Highlights  U.S.
Our California assets, which are expected to produce 125,000 equivalent barrels per day this year, together with our Permian operations, comprise the core of Oxy's domestic oil and gas business that will continue to generate income and cash for many years to come.
15
 
2005 Highlights  Libya
Let's now turn to Libya. Since it's difficult to grasp the magnitude of geographic areas outlined on a map, we thought we'd give you a little help by superimposing a map of Texas over a map of Libya. The purple blocks show Oxy's historic producing areas that we operated from the 1960s through the mid-1980s. The green blocks are the historical exploration areas we were awarded in the 1980s, and the blue blocks are the 9 exploration blocks we won in January 2005.
If you could move all of these blocks inside the Texas outline, you would readily see that Oxy's total acreage position in Libya would fill a large portion of Texas. Oxy's 30 million Libyan acres encompass an area larger than the entire Permian Basin.
As you know Libya played an important role in Oxy's early growth, and is poised to do so again.
Oxy's net production in Libya averaged about of 22,000 net barrels of oil per day in the first quarter, but the real excitement surrounds our Libyan exploration program  which is the largest exploration effort in Oxy's history. We are moving forward quickly and expect to drill at least 4 test wells this year.
16
 
2005 Highlights  Oman
Last year, we also were awarded a contract by the Government of Oman to operate the giant Mukhaizna oil field. It took 3 to 4 years of technical work and persistent negotiation to convince the Government that replacing the previous operator would significantly expand and accelerate the field's development.
Along with our partners, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion to increase production from 8,500 barrels per day - when we took over the Mukhaizna operation last September - to 150,000 barrels per day within the next few years.
We also have identified other high potential projects in Oman.
17
 
2005 Highlights  Argentina
Our acquisition of Vintage Petroleum has given Oxy a sizeable operation in Argentina that has significant growth potential. We are especially excited about the opportunities to significantly increase production, particularly in our properties in the southern part of the country.
We have identified numerous locations of proved undeveloped reserves. We expect to double production from these Argentina operations over the next 5 years to approximately 70,000 barrels per day.

When a company achieves these kind of results, investors want to know if and how we can sustain that high level of performance in the future. I'm confident we can because we have focused on the fundamentals to keep our oil and gas reserve base growing.
Our continued success in adding new reserves at a pace well ahead of production has increased our total proved reserves to historical highs in each of the last five years. At yearend 2005, our proved reserves were at a record high 2.71 billion equivalent barrels.
Our reserve additions set the stage for significant production growth over the next five years. We believe our proved reserves are headed for another record high at yearend, despite expectations of significantly higher production levels.

Target
After a careful review of our assets, we expect to grow our production by an average of about 6 percent per year through 2010. That rate of growth would increase in our base production to a of 740,000 equivalent barrels per day in 2010. This estimate is derived from projects already in our pipeline and does not depend on new EOR projects, future exploration success or new acquisitions.
MINIMUM
In addition, we have identified a number of new EOR opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa. We also believe we will have other opportunities to capture large projects in our core areas, including the U. S. and the Middle East - North Africa.
We expect to continue acquiring assets with upside potential in California and Texas. We see ourselves as natural consolidators in both regions given the size of our asset base and infrastructure.
With only modest success in capturing new projects that are not yet in our portfolio, we could achieve an average annual growth rate of up to 10 percent and reach a production level of 850,000 equivalent barrels per day in 2010.

Let's turn briefly to our chemical operations which also had an excellent year in 2005. The primary mission of our chemical business is to generate cash flow in excess of capital expenditures.
Over the past 5 years, our chemical business has generated more than $2 billion of cash flow. Last year alone, OxyChem produced $855 million of cash flow after capital.
2006 has the potential to be an even better year.

Our strategy for managing our chemical business is similar to our strategy for managing our oil and gas operations.
We focus on optimizing profitability and cash flow on a unit of production basis from large core assets where we have economies of scale. We aggressively manage our costs and maintain a disciplined program for capital spending.
As a result, OxyChem's operating profit as a percent of sales is the highest among our chemical industry peers. OxyChem's profit margin was 16.7 percent compared to the average profit margin for the group of 10.2 percent.
Strong margins in the first quarter helped us get off to a fast start this year.

We recently announced our financial and operational results for this year's first quarter.
With the strides we made last year to strengthen our oil and gas and chemical businesses, coupled with continuing robust energy prices and a strong economy, we're off to another outstanding year in 2006.
This year's quarterly results compare very favorably to last year's first quarter results.
While oil and gas income rose by 48 percent, and segment income from our chemical business was 16 percent higher, another very important factor was the 13 percent increase in our oil and gas production.
A production increase of this magnitude within a year by a company our size is a remarkable achievement. It is highly improbable that any of our competitors will come close to matching us.

Furthermore, Oxy is the oil company ranked in the top ten. Only two of our competitors are ranked in the top 50  ConocoPhillips at number 31 and Marathon at number 32.

Oxy's rankings are a testimonial to the guidance provided by our board of directors and the excellent management team we have in place. Institutional Investor Magazine, for example, has ranked Steve Chazen as the top Chief Financial Officer in the oil and gas industry for three consecutive years.
Above all, I want to pay tribute to our employees. Their performance has been exemplary, not only from a financial and operational perspective, but also as demonstrated by their commitment to responsible corporate citizenship.
I would now like to introduce Dr. Larry Meriage, our Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs, who will present our report on social responsibility and corporate governance.
