Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On August 4, 2006, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced income from continuing operations was $2.77 per diluted share for the second quarter 2006, compared with $3.63 per diluted share for the second quarter 2005. Net income for the second quarter 2006 was $857 million ($1.97 per diluted share), compared with $1.536 billion ($3.77 per diluted share) for the second quarter 2005.
 
Core earnings for the second quarter 2006 were $1.204 billion ($2.77 per diluted share), compared with $799 million ($1.96 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. The second quarter 2006 core earnings excludes a net after-tax loss of $347 million in discontinued operations, which includes the impairment charge for Occidental's Block 15 investment in Ecuador and income from Vintage properties held for sale. The second quarter 2005 core income excludes a $619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of tax issues with the IRS and an $89 million after-tax gain from the sale of an investment. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.953 billion for the second quarter 2006, a 56 percent increase from the $1.255 billion segment earnings for the second quarter 2005. The improvement in the second quarter 2006 earnings reflected a $557 million increase from higher worldwide crude oil prices, a $262 million increase from higher production, and lower exploration expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates.
 
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the second quarter 2006 was $70.70 per barrel compared to $53.17 per barrel in the second quarter 2005. Occidental's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $60.67 per barrel for the second quarter 2006, compared with $46.27 per barrel for the second quarter 2005. The average price for NYMEX gas in the second quarter 2006 was $7.26 per MMCF, compared with $6.80 per MMCF in the second quarter 2005. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $6.18 per MMCF in the second quarter 2005 to $6.24 per MMCF for the second quarter 2006.
 
Production
 
For the quarter, oil and gas daily production from continuing operations averaged 609,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), which was an 18 percent increase over the 516,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the second quarter 2005. The increase included Vintage production of 62,000 BOE per day and Libya production of 27,000 BOE per day.
 
Worldwide daily production from continuing operations for the six months of 2006 averaged 601,000 BOE, compared with 519,000 BOE for the six months of 2005. The increase included five months of Vintage production at 60,000 BOE per day which added 50,000 BOE per day to Occidental's year-to-date production and Libya production of 25,000 BOE per day that came on line in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical segment earnings were $250 million for the second quarter 2006, compared with $225 million for the second quarter 2005. The improvement in the second quarter 2006 results was due to chlor-alkali volume increases.
 
Six-Months Results
 
For the first six months of 2006, net income was $2.086 billion ($4.83 per diluted share), compared with $2.382 billion ($5.86 per diluted share) for the first six months of 2005.
 
Core earnings were $2.355 billion ($5.45 per diluted share) for 2006, compared with $1.612 billion ($3.96 per diluted share) for 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
 
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
 
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
 
August 4, 2006
Los Angeles, California
 
Good morning - and thank you for joining us.
As Steve Chazen will tell you in some detail shortly, our core earnings of $2.35 billion were the highest in the company's history for a six-month period. That's up 46 percent from the previous high set in the first half of 2005.
Our success in keeping production growing has allowed us to continue capturing the benefits of a strong energy price environment. During the second quarter, worldwide production from continuing operations of 609,000 equivalent barrels per day was 18 percent higher than last year's second quarter results. This year's results included 62,000 equivalent barrels per day from the recently acquired Vintage properties and 27,000 barrels per day from Libya. U.S. production of 365,000 equivalent barrels per day, which accounted for 60 percent of the worldwide total, was up 9 percent compared to last year's second quarter.
At our February analysts meeting we emphasized our commitment to creating top quartile total returns for our stockholders. Since that time, we completed an analysis of our dividend policy and raised the dividend by 22 percent after concluding that the company has the underlying financial strength to sustain the higher rate - even at significantly lower energy prices.
We also implemented a two-for-one split of our common stock.
In addition, we expanded our share repurchase program to 40 million post-split shares. This program is designed to enhance the value of the remaining shares.
We are continuing to make steady progress on all of our growth projects. The Mukhaizna development project in Oman, the growth plans for our Argentina operations and our Libya exploration and producing activities are moving on schedule. And, as I mentioned before, we are continuing to grow our base U.S. production.
We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash on hand, and we expect to continue generating a significant amount of free cash flow in the second half of the year to fund our growth and share repurchase initiatives. With the strides we made in the first half of the year, together with continuing strong energy prices and a strong economy, 2006 is shaping up as another outstanding year for both our oil and gas and chemical businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
 
August 4, 2006
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you, Ray.
Core earnings for the second quarter were $1.2 billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. That represents an increase of 50 percent compared to last year's second quarter core earnings of $799 million, or $1.96 per diluted share. The core earnings for this year's second quarter exclude a $347 million after-tax charge for discontinued operations, which includes impairment of Occidental's investment in Ecuador and income from Vintage properties held for sale. The core earnings for the second quarter in 2005 excluded a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a settlement with the IRS and an after-tax gain of $89 million from the sale of 11 million Lyondell shares.
Oil and gas segment core earnings for the quarter were approximately $1.95 billion, a 52 percent increase compared to $1.28 billion of core earnings for the second quarter of 2005.

Chemical earnings for the quarter were $250 million, up from $225 million earned in the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to improved chlor-alkali volumes resulting from the Vulcan acquisition. Price increases for chlor-alkali and PVC were offset by higher feedstock and energy costs. Chemical earnings for the first six months were $498 million, up from $439 million in the comparable period last year.
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of approximately $3.1 billion was 29 percent higher than the $2.4 billion we generated in the first half of 2005.
Net interest expense was $33 million for the quarter, and $62 million for the first six months. The worldwide effective tax rate for the second quarter was 42 percent. This was down from Oxy's forecast of 44 percent due to higher than expected domestic income, which has a lower tax rate than foreign income.
During the quarter, we spent a total of $748 million to repurchase 7.6 million common shares at an average price of $98.11 per share. Since we
 
 
5
 
 
implemented the share repurchase program last February, we have spent a total of $986 million to repurchase 10.2 million shares at an average price of $96.52 per share.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first half of the year totaled 427.3 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding totaled 432.2 million. At June 30, there were 426.6 million basic shares outstanding and the fully diluted shares numbered approximately 431.5 million.
Since the late January closing of the Vintage acquisition, the former Vintage properties held for sale generated $66 million of cash from operations. Through the end of the second quarter, proceeds from the sale of Vintage assets were approximately $700 million, and we expect to sell an additional $300 to $400 million of assets by the end of the current quarter. Proved reserves associated with these assets were about 71 million barrels of oil equivalent as on December 31, 2005. The assets will realize between $15 and $16 per proven barrel equivalent.
Turning to the balance sheet, we reduced total debt at the end of the quarter to the pre-Vintage acquisition level of $3 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. Stockholder equity at the end of the quarter was $18 billion, which was $2.9 billion higher than the year-end 2005 level and about even with the end of the first quarter. Our annualized return on equity during the first half of the year was 25 percent, with an annualized return on capital of 22 percent.
The second quarter cash flow from operations, after tax payments in excess of $1 billion, was $1.1 billion. We also received approximately $700 million from the sale of assets. We used the cash flow to fund capital expenditures of $646 million, debt repayment of $640 million, stock
 
 
6
 
 
repurchases totaling $748 million and dividend payments of $156 million. These cash outlays reduced our $2 billion cash balance at the end of the first quarter to $1.6 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Capital spending was $646 million for the quarter, and $1.24 billion for the first six months. We expect capital spending for the year to be $3 billion. While inflation in capital costs continues, the increase is within our original plan so our capital program remains at our original estimate.
As we look ahead in the third quarter:
