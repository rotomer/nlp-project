Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

In addition, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of amendments to the grandfathered Deferred Compensation Plan to, among other things split it into Deferred Compensation Plans 1 and 2, amendments to the Occidental 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2005 DC Plan") and the merger of Deferred Compensation Plan 2 with the 2005 DC Plan to form the Modified Deferred Compensation Plan effective as of January 1, 2007. The full texts of Amendment No. 3 to the 2005 Stock Program, the amendments to the stock awards, Deferred Compensation Plans 1 and 2, Amendment No. 2 to the 2005 DC Plan and the Modified Deferred Compensation Plan are filed as Exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 1
(Effective October 12, 2006)
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE
Effective October 12, 2006, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Prior Plan") is divided into two plans, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 1 and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 2. This document sets forth the terms of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 1 (the "Plan") effective October 12, 2006.
This Plan is a continuation of the Prior Plan to the extent that it provides benefits for the individuals listed on Appendix A attached hereto and their Alternate Payees.
The Prior Plan was originally effective January 1, 1999 and constituted the amendment, restatement and merger of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 1988 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "1988 DCP") and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Senior Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "SEDCP").
The purpose of the Plan is to provide a tax-deferred opportunity for key management and highly compensated employees of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its Affiliates (as defined below) to accumulate additional retirement income through deferrals of compensation. No further deferrals were allowed under this Plan after December 31, 2004. Accordingly, this Plan is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Various deferral options will be made available to Eligible Employees under the Plan, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Committee may impose from time to time, in its complete and sole discretion. A Deferral Election Form filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2003, or for any subsequent Plan Year shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year and shall remain in effect for that Plan Year and subsequent Plan Years, notwithstanding any change in the Participant's Base Salary or Bonus, until changed or terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1; provided, however, that such election shall terminate if the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee. Subject to the minimum deferral requirements and maximum deferral limitations set forth below, a Participant may increase, decrease or termina te his deferral election effective for Compensation to be earned during any Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year.
Each Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus, or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant.

If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum. The Early Payment Date elected must be a year that begins at least two (2) years after the end of the first Plan Year to which the election applies.

A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of Early Payment Benefit with respect to Compensation deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a).
A Participant may not at any time have more than two Early Payment Dates scheduled. However, after an Early Payment Date has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Date election have been completed, a Participant may elect a new Early Payment Date for future deferrals of Compensation.
4.2  . The Committee shall establish and maintain a separate DCP Deferral Account for each Participant. The amount credited to a Participant's Deferral Account under the 1988 DCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to his DCP Deferral Account under this Plan as of January 1, 1999. A DCP Deferral Amount shall be credited by the Company to the Participant's DCP Deferral Account as of the date that the Participant's Base Salary or Bonus would otherwise have been paid. Such DCP Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. The Committee shall establish an Early Payment Date Subaccount within a Participant's DCP Deferral Account for each Early Payment Date elected by that Participant. Any such Early Payment Date Subaccount shall be debited by the amount of any Early Payment Benefit paid by the Company to the Participant on or beginning on such Early Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.4 as of the date of payment.
DCP Deferral Accounts
4.3  . The Committee shall maintain a separate SEDCP Deferral Account for each Participant who was a participant in the SEDCP on December 31, 1998. The balance of such Participant's accounts under the SEDCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to each such Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account under this Plan as of January 1, 1999. SEDCP Deferral Accounts shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment.
SEDCP Deferral Accounts
4.4  . Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the Declared Rate for each Plan Year, compounded monthly. Except as provided in Section 5.2(a) with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account. Effective January 1, 2003, amounts of deferred Compensation that are credited to a Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed on the basis of a 30-day month based on days elapsed from date of crediting to the end of the month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2009, each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the annualized Declared Rate for the month. Such interest shall be credited to the Participant's Deferral Account balance as of the last day of the month and shall be determined by multiplying
Interest

the Deferral Account balance as of the end of the preceding month times the annualized Declared Rate for the current month.
4.5  . The value of a Deferral Account as of any date shall equal the amounts previously credited to such Deferral Account less any payments debited to such Deferral Account plus the interest deemed to be earned on such Deferral Account in accordance with Section 4.4 through the end of the preceding month. When payments are made from a DCP Deferral Account for any reason other than an Early Payment Benefit elected after January 1, 1994, such payments shall be deemed to be made on a proportionate or pro-rata basis from DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred under the 1988 DCP prior to January 1, 1994 and DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and defer red after that date.
Valuation of Deferral Accounts
4.6  . For each Plan Year, the Company shall credit to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of any Participant, an amount equal to the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant's Base Salary for such Plan Year because of deferrals under this Plan. The Savings Plan Restoration Contribution shall be credited to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of each Participant for each Plan Year at the same time as the Company contribution for such Plan Year is made to the Savings Plan. A Participant's interest in any credit to his Savings Plan Restoration Account and earnings thereon shall vest at the same rate and at the same time as would have been the case had such contribution been made to the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, upon a Participant's termination of employment, the Participant has not or does not become 100% vested in his Savings Plan Restoration Account, the unvested portion of his Savings Plan Restoration Account shall be forfeited prior to the determination of the amount of any benefits under Sections 5.1, 5.6 or 5.7. Effective as of January 1, 2005, that portion of a Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, shall be transferred to and credited to such Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2005 DCP") and shall be governed by the terms of the 2005 DCP, including any Distribution Election Form filed under the 2005 DCP on or before December 31, 2005.
Savings Plan Restoration Contribution
4.7  . The Committee shall submit to each Participant, within 120 days after the close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable, setting forth the Participant's Deferral Account(s).
Statement of Deferral Accounts
4.8  . Notwithstanding any other Plan provision to the contrary, no amount of Compensation earned for services performed in Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2004 shall be deferred under this Plan, and no Savings Plan Restoration Contributions shall be credited under this Plan with respect to Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2004. Accordingly, any election to defer Compensation under this Plan shall terminate as to future earnings as of December 31, 2004 and shall no longer have any force or effect as to future earnings. Bonuses that were earned in 2004 and subject to deferral elections under the terms of this Plan shall not be credited under this Plan, but shall be (1) credited under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with its
Cessation of Compensation Deferrals

terms and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such plan, including, without limitation, its distribution provisions or (2) if elected by the Participant, paid in cash to the Participant in 2005.

If a Participant's employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, then Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit in a lump sum as provided in Section 5.1(a); provided, however, at the sole discretion of the Committee, no lump sum shall be payable and instead, the Company shall pay to the Participant an annual amount for a period not to exceed three (3) years, determined using the Fractional Method.

(d)  . If a Participant's employment with the Company terminates prior to Retirement due to a Disability, then the Participant shall receive a Disability Benefit in a lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 55 in an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
Disability
(e)  . Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant who terminates employment prior to Retirement and receives a Termination Benefit or a Disability Benefit under this Section 5.1.
Effect of Pre-Retirement Termination of Employment on Spousal Survivor Benefits
5.2  .
Beneficiary Benefits
(a)  If a Participant dies while employed by the Company prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, the Company shall pay to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum an amount equal to the value of the Participant's DCP Deferral Account and Savings Plan Restoration Account, if any. If such Participant also has an SEDCP Deferral Account, the Company will also pay to the Participant's Beneficiary annual payments over the greater of (i) 10 years or (ii) until the Participant would have attained age 65 equal to 25% of the amount deferred under the SEDCP (excluding any interest on such deferrals), which payments shall be in full satisfaction of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant's Beneficiary shall instead be paid the amount credited to th e Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which his death occurred plus interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, from the end of such month and credited annually on each anniversary of the end of such month payable in equal installments (using the Amortization method) over the period described in the succeeding sentence, if the Committee determines that the present value of such benefit is greater than the present value of the benefit described in the preceding sentence. In comparing the present value of these two alternative benefits, the Committee shall use in each case a discount factor of 8%.
(b)  If a Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement, the Company will pay to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum a Beneficiary Benefit that is an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts.
(c)  If a Participant dies after the commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit, then the remaining installments of the Retirement Benefit shall be payable to his
 
12
 
 
Beneficiary in the same amounts and at the same times as such installment would have been paid to the Participant if he were living.
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, a Participant may elect at any time that if he dies prior to the commencement of his Retirement Benefits, then the payment to his Beneficiary shall be made in any form and calculated in any other manner described in Section 5.1(b). Such an election shall be on a Distribution Election Form.
(e)  The payment or payments to a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant under this Section 5.2 shall be made or commence during the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year in which the Participant's death occurred, and the amount of such payment shall be equal to, or determined based on, the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
(f)   In the event that the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies prior to the completion of payments under this Plan to that Beneficiary, all remaining payments to that Beneficiary shall be paid in a lump sum to that Beneficiary's estate.
5.3  . If a Participant who has an SEDCP Deferral Account dies after becoming eligible for Retirement or after commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit and a spouse to whom he had been married to for at least one (1) year prior to his death survives beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance, the Company shall pay such spouse a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 10% of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance valued as of the earlier of the date of the Participant's Retirement or death. Such lump sum spousal survivor benefit shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the later of the completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance or the Participant's death. No benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.3 if the Participant's spouse does not survive beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no spousal survivor benefit shall be payable to the spouse of any Participant who received benefits pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (Termination Benefit), Section 5.1(d) (Disability Benefit) or Section 5.6 (Immediate Payment on Termination Event).
Spousal Survivor Benefits with Respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts
5.4  . Payment of the amounts credited to any Early Payment Date Subaccount of a Participant shall be paid or commence to be paid within the first 90 days of the year elected as the Early Payment Date in accordance with the Participant's election under Section 4.1(b), with any subsequent annual payments paid in the first 90 days of each applicable year. The amount of each annual installment will be determined under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. The amount of any such annual payments shall be calculated under the Amortization Method for Early Payment Dates elected prior to 2003 and unless the Participant otherwise irrevocably elects at the time of making the Early Payment Benefit Election, under the Fractional Method for Early Payment Dates elected in 2003 and later.
Early Payment
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason prior to commencement or completion of all Early Payment Benefits, all such elections made by the Participant to receive Early Payment Benefits shall terminate and any amounts remaining credited to the Participant's Early Payment Date Subaccount(s) shall be
 
13
 
 
paid, together with the other amounts credited to the Participant's Deferral Account, as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be.
5.5  . In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an unforeseeable financial emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, an amount up to the balance of the Participant's Deferral Accounts that is necessary to meet the emergency ("Emergency Benefit"). Such payment shall come first from the amounts not credited to any Early Payment Date Subaccount and, if the Participant has elected two (2) Early Payment Dates, next from the Early Payment Date Subaccount for the later Early Payment Date. No amount may be paid to the Participant under this Section 5.5 from any unvested portion of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account. For purposes of this Plan, an unforeseeable financial emergency is a severe financial hardship to the Participant arising from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the Participant or a dependent of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to a casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. Cash needs arising from foreseeable events such as the purchase of a home or education expenses for children shall normally not be considered to be the result of an unforeseeable financial emergency.
Emergency Benefit
Whenever a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.5, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the distribution. The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next enrollment period under the Plan and will be precluded from electing to make new deferrals under the Plan for a minimum period of one (1) year (or such lesser period as the Committee may permit) following receipt of the distribution.
5.6  . Upon petition of a Participant within 60 days after any Termination Event or such other period as the Committee may permit, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may direct the Company to pay the balance of the Participant's Deferral Accounts, reduced by any unvested portion of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account, to him immediately in a lump sum as a Termination Benefit pursuant to Section 5.1, irrespective of whether the Participant terminates or continues employment with the Company. Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant who receives benefits under this Section 5.6.
Immediate Payment on Termination Event
5.7  . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that the value of a Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the Plan Year in which the Participant's Retirement or other termination of employment occurs is less than $20,000 (after reduction for any forfeiture pursuant to Section 4.6), such amount (with interest to the end of the month preceding the payment date) shall be paid in a cash lump sum without regard to any contrary elections, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Small Benefit
5.8  . Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, in lieu of payments in accordance with the form previously elected by the Participant, a Participant (or his Beneficiary, in the event of the Participant's death) may elect at any time to receive an immediate lump sum payment of all or part of the vested balance of the Participant's
Lump Sum Payment With Penalty
 
14
 
 
Deferral Accounts, reduced by a penalty, which shall be forfeited to the Company, equal to 10% of the amount withdrawn from the Participant's Deferral Accounts. Such payment shall come first from the amounts not credited to any Early Payment Date Subaccount and, if the Participant has elected two (2) Early Payment Dates, next from the Early Payment Date Subaccount for the later Early Payment Date. No amount may be paid to a Participant under this Section 5.8 from any unvested portion of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account.
Whenever a Participant receives a lump sum payment under this Section 5.8, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the lump sum payment. The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next enrollment period under the Plan and will be precluded from electing to make new deferrals under the Plan for a minimum period of one (1) year (or such lesser period as the Committee may permit) following receipt of the lump sum payment.
5.9  .
Tax Withholding and Reporting
(a)  To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, the Company shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law.
(b)  The Company shall have the right at its option to (i) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts or (ii) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts.
(c)  The tax withholding and reporting rules described in this subsection shall apply to payments made under the Plan pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order, shall be subject to any applicable superceding guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall apply in addition to (not in substitution of) the preceding two subsections. Amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to federal income tax withholding and, together with amounts so withheld, shall be reportable to the Alternate Payee. In addition, amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to taxation under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ("FUTA") to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid to the Participant. To the extent that amounts paid to an Alternate Payee are subject to taxation under FICA and/or FUTA, such payments shall be treated as the wages of the Participant, and shall be so reportable, but any amounts required under FICA to be withheld from such payments shall be withheld from the payments to the Alternate Payee.
5.10  . For the purpose of this Article V, a Participant will be deemed to have terminated employment if the Participant ceases to be an employee of any of the following:
Termination of Employment
(a)  the Company;
(b)  an Affiliate; or
 
 
15
 
 
 
(c)  any other entity, whether or not incorporated, in which the Company has an ownership interest, and the Committee has designated that the Participant's commencement of employment with such entity upon Participant's ceasing to be an employee of an entity described in (a) or (b) above will not be deemed to be a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan, provided that such designation shall be made in writing by the Committee and shall be communicated to the Participant prior to his commencement of employment with the entity so designated.
For the purposes of the preceding provisions, a Participant who ceases to be an employee of an entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above shall not be deemed to have terminated employment if such cessation of employment is followed immediately by his commencement of employment with another entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above.
5.11  . If a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated and such Participant is re-employed by the Company prior to the payment of his benefits in a cash lump sum payment or while he is receiving benefits in the form of annual installment payments, the payment of the lump sum amount or the future installments, as the case may be, shall be suspended until he again terminates employment with the Company. Such Participant may elect to again participate in this Plan and to defer additional Base Salary and/or Bonus as provided in Section 4.1. Such rehired Participant may file a Distribution Election Form as provided in Section 5.1(b) and/or Section 5.2(d) to be applicable to all amounts deferred under this Plan (both before and after his original termination of emp loyment); provided, however, that such Distribution Election Form shall not be effective as to the form of payment of Retirement Benefits until 12 months after it is received by the Committee. Upon the Participant's subsequent termination of employment with the Company, the total amounts then credited to his Deferral Accounts shall be distributed in accordance with Article V of this Plan and the most recently filed Distribution Election Form (if any) that has become effective. If the Participant's original termination of employment was on account of Retirement and he had elected a form of installment payout, then the amounts credited to his Deferral Accounts at the time of his subsequent Retirement shall be distributed over the number of years that were remaining in the payout period at the time of his re-employment unless he filed a new Distribution Election Form at least 12 months prior to his subsequent Retirement.
Re-Employment
5.12      . Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Committee under Section 9.3(b) hereof and the provisions of this Plan, benefits may be paid from the balance of a Participant's Deferral Account(s) in accordance with a Qualified Divorce Order without regard to whether the Participant has terminated employment in accordance with Section 5.10 hereof. In addition, and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall follow any distribution requirement contained in a Qualified Divorce Order that provides for an earlier lump sum distribution than would otherwise be permitted under this Plan.
Qualified Divorce Orders
ARTICLE VI
BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION
Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as the Beneficiary to whom payments under this Plan shall be made in the event of the
 
16
 
 
Participant's death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime on a paper form prescribed by the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed.
If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, any benefits remaining unpaid shall be paid in accordance with the Participant's Beneficiary designation under the Company's Retirement Plan, and if there is no such valid Beneficiary designation, to the Participant's then surviving spouse, or if none, to the Participant's estate, unless directed otherwise by the court that has jurisdiction over the assets belonging to the Participant's probate estate.

8.1  . The Board may amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, tax, accounting or other changes, which may result in termination of the Plan for future deferrals. The Committee, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if the Committee determines that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease Plan benefits or costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment shall: (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted; (b) eliminate the spousal survivor benefit under Section 5.3; or (c) change the definition of the Declared Rate set forth in Article II for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted, produces a rate that is less than the lesser of: (i) Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted), or (ii) the highest yield on any unsecured debt or preferred stock of the Company that was outstanding on the last day of the month immediately preceding the date such amendment is adopted.

Termination
(a)  . The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, if in the Board's judgment, the continuance of the Plan would not be in the Company's best interest due to tax, accounting or other effects thereof, or potential payouts thereunder, provided that any termination of the Plan shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date the Board adopts a resolution to terminate the Plan, unless the termination of the Plan is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Termination Event, the Plan may not be terminated prior to the date that is three years after the date the Termination Event occurs. In the event the Board adopts a resolution terminating the Plan, the Board or the Committee shall determine the date as of which all deferral elections shall cease to apply so that no further Base Salary or Bonus shall be deferred under the Plan.
Company's Right to Terminate
(b)  .

Payments Upon Termination
ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS
9.1  . The rights of a Participant, Beneficiary, or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company, nor shall any assets of the Company be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises.
Unsecured General Creditor
9.2  . The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.

(a)  Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, or interest therein which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized. The Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Committee constitutes a Qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders. In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order.
9.4  . A Participant's right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of a Participant's Deferral Account(s) has been paid or set side for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order or to the extent that the Company or the Plan is otherwise subject to a binding judgment, decree, or order for the attachment, garnishment or execution of any portion of the Participant's Deferral Account(s) or of any distributions therefrom. The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts, and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order.
Release from Liability to Participant
9.5  .

OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 2
(Effective October 12, 2006)
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE
Effective October 12, 2006, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Prior Plan") is divided into two plans, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 1 and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 2. This document sets forth the terms of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan 2 (the "Plan") effective October 12, 2006. This Plan is a continuation of the Prior Plan to the extent that it provides benefits for the individuals who participated in the Prior Plan but are not covered by the DCP1, and their Alternate Payees.
The Prior Plan was originally effective January 1, 1999 and constituted the amendment, restatement and merger of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 1988 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "1988 DCP") and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Senior Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "SEDCP").
The purpose of the Plan is to provide a tax-deferred opportunity for key management and highly compensated employees of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its Affiliates (as defined below) to accumulate additional retirement income through deferrals of compensation. No further deferrals were allowed under this Plan after December 31, 2004. Accordingly, this Plan has not been subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 409A"). However, this Plan is hereby made subject to Section 409A and amended and restated to comply with Section 409A effective October 12, 2006 in anticipation of the merger of this Plan with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan to form the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Modified Deferred Compensation Plan on December 31, 2006.
This Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, so that the taxation to Participants or Beneficiaries of any compensation deferred under this Plan is deferred.

ARTICLE IV
PARTICIPATION
4.1  .
Election to Participate
(a)  . An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan and elect to defer annual Base Salary and/or Bonus under the Plan by filing a completed and fully executed Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of the Plan Year during which such Base Salary and Bonus are to be earned or at such other time as the Committee may permit. Deferral Election Forms must be filed in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Forms.
Deferral Elections
Various deferral options will be made available to Eligible Employees under the Plan, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Committee may impose from time to time, in its complete and sole discretion. A Deferral Election Form filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2003, or for any subsequent Plan Year shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year and shall remain in effect for that Plan Year and subsequent Plan Years, notwithstanding any change in the Participant's Base Salary or Bonus, until changed or terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1; provided, however, that such election shall terminate if the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Employee. Subject to the minimum deferral requirements and maximum deferral limitations set forth below, a Participant may increase, decrease or termina te his deferral election effective for Compensation to be earned during any Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year.
Each Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus, or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant. Deferrals of Base Salary will normally be deducted ratably during the Plan Year. In its sole discretion, the Committee may also permit amounts that an Eligible Employee has previously elected to defer under other plans or agreements with the
 
8
 
 
Company to be transferred to this Plan and credited to his Deferral Accounts that are maintained hereunder.
(A)       . For each Plan Year, the minimum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is $5,000, if expressed as a dollar amount, or 5% of Base Salary, if expressed as a percentage, and the minimum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is any of the following: (I) $5,000, (II) 5% of Bonus, or (III) 100% of that portion of any Bonus that exceeds a dollar amount specified by the Participant on his Deferral Election Form.
Minimum Deferral
(B)        . For each Plan Year, the maximum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is 75% of Base Salary, and the maximum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is 100% of Bonus.
Maximum Deferral
(b)  . On the Deferral Election Form filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a), an Eligible Employee may irrevocably elect to receive the Compensation deferred pursuant to that election in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over two (2) to five (5) years commencing prior to Retirement on an Early Payment Date. If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum. The Early Payment Date elected must be a year that begins at least two (2) years after the end of the first Plan Year to which the election applies. An Early Payment Benefit election filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2003, or for any subsequent Plan Year, shall be effective for Compensation earned and deferred during that Plan Year and each subsequent Plan Year until terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1; provided, however, that deferrals of Compensation earned during any Plan Year that ends less than two (2) years prior to the Early Payment Date will not be subject to the Early Payment Benefit election and shall be paid upon the Participant's termination of employment as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be. A Participant may terminate an election for an Early Payment Benefit with respect to Compensation deferred in any future Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year. A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of Early Payment Benefit with respect to Compensation deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a).
Early Payment Benefit Election
A Participant may not at any time have more than two Early Payment Dates scheduled. However, after an Early Payment Date has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Date election have been completed, a Participant may elect a new Early Payment Date for future deferrals of Compensation.
4.2  . The Committee shall establish and maintain a separate DCP Deferral Account for each Participant. The amount credited to a Participant's Deferral Account under the 1988 DCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to his DCP Deferral Account under this Plan as of January 1, 1999. A DCP Deferral Amount shall be credited by the Company to the Participant's DCP Deferral Account as of the date that the Participant's Base Salary or Bonus would otherwise have been paid. Such DCP Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. The Committee shall establish an Early
DCP Deferral Accounts
 
9
 
 
Payment Date Subaccount within a Participant's DCP Deferral Account for each Early Payment Date elected by that Participant. Any such Early Payment Date Subaccount shall be debited by the amount of any Early Payment Benefit paid by the Company to the Participant on or beginning on such Early Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.4 as of the date of payment.
4.3  . The Committee shall maintain a separate SEDCP Deferral Account for each Participant who was a participant in the SEDCP on December 31, 1998. The balance of such Participant's accounts under the SEDCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to each such Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account under this Plan as of January 1, 1999. SEDCP Deferral Accounts shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment.
SEDCP Deferral Accounts
4.4  . Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the Declared Rate for each Plan Year, compounded monthly. Except as provided in Section 5.2(a) with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account. Effective January 1, 2003, amounts of deferred Compensation that are credited to a Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed on the b asis of a 30-day month based on days elapsed from date of crediting to the end of the month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2009, each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the annualized Declared Rate for the month. Such interest shall be credited to the Participant's Deferral Account balance as of the last day of the month and shall be determined by multiplying the Deferral Account balance as of the end of the preceding month times the annualized Declared Rate for the current month.
Interest
4.5  . The value of a Deferral Account as of any date shall equal the amounts previously credited to such Deferral Account less any payments debited to such Deferral Account plus the interest deemed to be earned on such Deferral Account in accordance with Section 4.4 through the end of the preceding month. When payments are made from a DCP Deferral Account for any reason other than an Early Payment Benefit elected after January 1, 1994, such payments shall be deemed to be made on a proportionate or pro-rata basis from DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred under the 1988 DCP prior to January 1, 1994 and DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and defer red after that date.
Valuation of Deferral Accounts
4.6  . For each Plan Year, the Company shall credit to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of any Participant, an amount equal to the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant's Base Salary for such Plan Year because of deferrals under this Plan. The Savings Plan Restoration Contribution shall be credited to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of each Participant for each Plan Year at the same time as the Company contribution for such Plan Year
Savings Plan Restoration Contribution
 
10
 
 
is made to the Savings Plan. A Participant's interest in any credit to his Savings Plan Restoration Account and earnings thereon shall vest at the same rate and at the same time as would have been the case had such contribution been made to the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, upon a Participant's termination of employment, the Participant has not or does not become 100% vested in his Savings Plan Restoration Account, the unvested portion of his Savings Plan Restoration Account shall be forfeited prior to the determination of the amount of any benefits under Sections 5.1, 5.6 or 5.7. Effective as of January 1, 2005, that portion of a Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, shall be transferred to and credited to such Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account under the O ccidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2005 DCP") and shall be governed by the terms of the 2005 DCP, including any Distribution Election Form filed under the 2005 DCP on or before December 31, 2005.
4.7  . The Committee shall submit to each Participant, within 120 days after the close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable, setting forth the Participant's Deferral Account(s).
Statement of Deferral Accounts
4.8  . Notwithstanding any other Plan provision to the contrary, no amount of Compensation earned for services performed in Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2004 shall be deferred under this Plan, and no Savings Plan Restoration Contributions shall be credited under this Plan with respect to Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2004. Accordingly, any election to defer Compensation under this Plan shall terminate as to future earnings as of December 31, 2004 and shall no longer have any force or effect as to future earnings. Bonuses that were earned in 2004 and subject to deferral elections under the terms of this Plan shall not be credited under this Plan, but shall be (1) credited under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with its terms and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such plan, including, without limitation, its distribution provisions or (2) if elected by the Participant, paid in cash to the Participant in 2005. No new deferral elections shall be made under Article IV of this Plan with respect to Compensation earned after December 31, 2004. Interest shall continue to be credited to each Participant's Deferral Accounts as provided in Section 4.4.

Termination of Employment for a Reason Other Than Death
(a)  . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.1, upon a Participant's termination of employment for a reason other than death (including Retirement and Disability), the Company shall pay to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the Participant's termination of employment an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment (after reduction for any forfeitures as set forth in Section 4.6). Any Retirement Benefits paid in annual installments pursuant to Section 5.1(b) shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year, beginning with the year following the Participant's Retirement or other termination of employment and shall be determined based on the value of
Form and Time of Benefit
 
11
 
 
the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the last day of the month preceding payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Participant who is a Specified Employee is entitled to a distribution from the Plan upon or by virtue of such Participant's termination of employment for a reason other than death or Disability, the lump sum payment or the first annual installment payment, as the case may be, shall not be paid before the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's termination of employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). Any additional installment payments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year.
(b)  . A Participant may elect in his Distribution Election Form to have the Retirement Benefit, which may consist solely of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account, paid to him in a lump sum, annual payments for any other number of years between two (2) and 20 years or, if available as an option on the Distribution Election Form provided to the Participant, in a combination of an initial lump sum payment followed by annual installments over the next one (1) to 20 years. The amount of each annual installment will be determined under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. Unless the Participant otherwise elects, the amount of any such annual payments shall be calculated under the Amortization Method in the case of a Participant retiring before 2004 and under the Fractional Method in the case of a Participant retiring in 2004 and subsequent years.
Retirement
(c)  . If a Participant's employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, the Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit in a lump sum as provided in Section 5.1(a).
Termination Prior to Retirement
(d)  . If a Participant ceases to perform services for the Company prior to Retirement due to a Disability, then the Participant shall receive a Disability Benefit in a lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 55 in an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
Disability
(e)  . Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant who terminates employment prior to Retirement and receives a Termination Benefit or a Disability Benefit under this Section 5.1.

5.2  .
Beneficiary Benefits
(a)  If a Participant dies while employed by the Company prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, the Company shall pay to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum an amount equal to the value of the Participant's DCP Deferral Account and Savings Plan Restoration Account, if any. If such Participant also has an SEDCP Deferral Account, the Company will also pay to the Participant's Beneficiary annual payments over the greater of (i) 10 years or (ii) until the Participant would have attained age 65 equal to 25% of the amount deferred under the SEDCP (excluding any interest on such deferrals), which payments shall be in full satisfaction of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant's Beneficiary shall instead be paid the amount credited to th e Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account as of the end of the month in
 
12
 
 
which his death occurred plus interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, from the end of such month and credited annually on each anniversary of the end of such month payable in equal installments (using the Amortization method) over the period described in the preceding sentence, if the Committee determines that the present value of such benefit is greater than the present value of the benefit described in the preceding sentence. In comparing the present value of these two alternative benefits, the Committee shall use in each case a discount factor of 8%.
(b)  If a Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement, the Company will pay to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum a Beneficiary Benefit that is an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts.
(c)  If a Participant dies after the commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit, then the remaining installments of the Retirement Benefit shall be payable to his Beneficiary in the same amounts and at the same times as such installment would have been paid to the Participant if he were living.
(d)  The payment or payments to a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant under this Section 5.2 shall be made or commence during the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year in which the Participant's death occurred, and the amount of such payment shall be equal to, or determined based on, the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
(e)  In the event that the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies prior to the completion of payments under this Plan to that Beneficiary, all remaining payments to that Beneficiary shall be paid in a lump sum to that Beneficiary's estate.
(f)   Any election as to the form and manner of payment to a Beneficiary in effect under the terms of the Prior Plan on October 11, 2006, shall remain in effect unless or until changed in accordance with Section 5.12 or future amendments to this Plan.
5.3  . If a Participant who has an SEDCP Deferral Account dies after becoming eligible for Retirement or after commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit and a spouse to whom he had been married to for at least one (1) year prior to his death survives beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance, the Company shall pay such spouse a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 10% of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance valued as of the earlier of the date of the Participant's Retirement or death. Such lump sum spousal survivor benefit shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the later of the completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account bala nce or the Participant's death. No benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.3 if the Participant's spouse does not survive beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no spousal survivor benefit shall be payable to the spouse of any Participant who received benefits pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (Termination Prior to Retirement), Section 5.1(d) (Disability) or Section 5.6 (Effect of Termination Event).
Spousal Survivor Benefits with Respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts
5.4  . Payment of the amounts credited to any Early Payment Date Subaccount of a Participant shall be paid or commence to be paid within the first 90 days of the
Early Payment
 
13
 
 
year elected as the Early Payment Date in accordance with the Participant's election under Section 4.1(b), with any subsequent annual payments paid in the first 90 days of each applicable year. The amount of each annual installment will be determined under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. The amount of any such annual payments shall be calculated under the Amortization Method for Early Payment Dates elected prior to 2003 and unless the Participant otherwise irrevocably elects at the time of making the Early Payment Benefit Election, under the Fractional Method for Early Payment Dates elected in 2003 and later.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason prior to commencement or completion of all Early Payment Benefits, all such elections made by the Participant to receive Early Payment Benefits shall terminate and any amounts remaining credited to the Participant's Early Payment Date Subaccount(s) shall be paid, together with the other amounts credited to the Participant's Deferral Account, as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be.
5.5  . In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, an Emergency Benefit that does not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship and the additional compensation availabl e to the Participant upon the termination of the Participant's current deferral elections under the Plan, as described in the following paragraph of this Section 5.5. No amount may be paid to the Participant under this Section 5.5 from any unvested portion of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account.
Emergency Benefit
Whenever a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.5, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the distribution. The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next enrollment period under the Plan and will be precluded from electing to make new deferrals under the Plan for a minimum period of one (1) year (or such lesser period as the Committee may permit) following receipt of the distribution.
5.6  . In the event of a Termination Event that constitutes a "change in the ownership or effective control" of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code, the Company may, in its sole discretion terminate this Plan within the 30 days preceding such Termination Event, provided that all substantially similar arrangements sponsored by the Company are terminated and all Participants in this Plan and all participants in substantially similar arrangements receive all amounts of compensation deferred under the terminated arrangements within 12 months of the date of termination of all the arrangements.
Effect of Termination Event
5.7  . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that the value of a Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the Plan Year in which
Small Benefit
 
14
 
 
the Participant's Retirement occurs is less than $20,000 (after reduction for any forfeiture pursuant to Section 4.6), such amount (with interest to the end of the month preceding the payment date) shall be paid in a cash lump sum without regard to any contrary elections. Such payment shall be made at the time set forth in Section 5.1(a) unless a different distribution date is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
5.8  .
Tax Withholding and Reporting
(a)  To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, the Company shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law.
(b)  The Company shall have the right at its option to (i) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts or (ii) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts.
(c)  The tax withholding and reporting rules described in this subsection shall apply to payments made under the Plan pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order, shall be subject to any applicable superceding guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall apply in addition to (not in substitution of) the preceding two subsections. Amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to federal income tax withholding and, together with amounts so withheld, shall be reportable to the Alternate Payee. In addition, amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to taxation under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ("FUTA") to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid to the Participant. To the extent that amounts paid to an Alternate Payee are subject to taxation under FICA and/or FUTA, such payments shall be treated as the wages of the Participant, and shall be so reportable, but any amounts required under FICA to be withheld from such payments shall be withheld from the payments to the Alternate Payee.
5.9  . For the purpose of this Article V, a Participant will be deemed to have terminated employment if the Participant ceases to be an employee of any of the following:
Termination of Employment
(a)  Occidental Petroleum Corporation;
(b)  an Affiliate; or
(c)  any other entity, whether or not incorporated, in which the Company has an ownership interest, and the Committee has designated that the Participant's commencement of employment with such entity upon Participant's ceasing to be an employee of an entity described in (a) or (b) above will not be deemed to be a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan, provided that such designation shall be made in writing by the Committee and shall be communicated to the Participant prior to his commencement of employment with the entity so designated.
 
15
 
 
 
For the purposes of the preceding provisions, a Participant who ceases to be an employee of an entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above shall not be deemed to have terminated employment if such cessation of employment is followed immediately by his commencement of employment with another entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for any purpose under this Plan unless such termination of employment constitutes "a separation from service" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations promulgated thereunder.
5.10  . If a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated and such Participant is re-employed by the Company prior to the payment of his benefits in a cash lump sum payment or while he is receiving benefits in the form of annual installment payments, the payment of the lump sum amount or the future installments, as the case may be, shall be suspended until he again terminates employment with the Company. Upon a Participant's subsequent termination of employment, distribution of his benefits under the Plan shall commence or resume in the same form as the benefits were payable at his earlier termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.10 shall only apply to the extent it does not violate Section 409A of the Code.
Re-Employment
5.11  . Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Committee under Section 9.3(b) hereof and the provisions of this Plan, benefits may be paid from the balance of a Participant's Deferral Account(s) in accordance with a Qualified Divorce Order.

As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive his Retirement Benefit in any form described in Section 5.1 and calculated under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. In addition, the Participant may elect up to two Early Payment Dates with installment payments (if any) calculated under the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(b) or Section 5.4 to the contrary, a Participant may elect any Early Payment Date other than 2006 regardless of the year in which the Compensation was deferred, except that (i) the earliest Early Payment Date that a Participant may elect with respect to his 2006 Deferred Bonus is 2008, and (ii) if a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Date with respect to his December 31 Balance, payment will be made in July of 2007. A Participant may elect that all, any portion or no portion of his December 31 Balance and/or all, any portion or no portion of his 2006 Deferred Bonus be paid on an Early Payment Date, but (i) the Participant may not select more than two
 
16
 
 
Early Payment Dates under this Special Transition Rule Election and (ii) the Participant may not make different elections with respect to the form or manner of calculation of his Retirement Benefit with respect to his December 31 Balance and his 2006 Deferred Bonus.
(b)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has separated from service due to Retirement as of October 12, 2006, he may make a new payment election with respect to his December 31 Balance. As part of such election, the Participant may elect (1) to receive a lump sum distribution of his entire Deferral Account balance in July of 2007 or (2) to change the number of Retirement Benefit installment payments as permitted under Section 5.1, provided that the Participant may not extend the number of installments to more than twenty annual installments (including installment payments that have already been made).
(c)  If a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Date for his December 31 Balance, he may not elect to defer any Compensation earned in 2007 under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Modified Deferred Compensation Plan.
(d)  In addition, as part of the special election under this Section 5.12, a Participant may change the form and manner of calculation of the payment of benefits to his Beneficiary in the event that the Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement.
(e)  A Participant must elect the same form and manner of calculating his Retirement Benefit under (a) or (b) of this Section 5.12 and the same form and manner of calculating his Beneficiary Benefit under (d) of this Section 5.12 as he elects for such benefits under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Modified Deferred Compensation Plan.
(f)   Any election under this Section 5.12 must be made by November 3, 2006, or such later date as permitted by the Committee, but in no event later than December 31, 2006.
(g)  A Participant's election under this Section 5.12 shall supersede any previous election made or deemed to be made under this Plan. If a Participant does not timely make an election under this Section 5.12, the elections he otherwise made or makes or was deemed to make shall apply and may be changed only in accordance with the other terms of this Plan. However, any distribution election that had not become effective by October 12, 2006, shall be null and void.
ARTICLE VI
BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION
Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as the Beneficiary to whom payments under this Plan shall be made in the event of the Participant's death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime on a paper form prescribed by the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed.

ARTICLE VIII
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN
8.1  . The Board may amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, tax, accounting or other changes, which may result in termination of the Plan for future deferrals. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board may amend the Plan to (a) ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution and (b) add provisions for changes to elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution.

regulations and guidance thereunder, each Participant who has not separated from service as of October 12, 2006 may make a new payment election (a Special Transition Rule Election') with respect to (i) the balance of his Deferral Accounts as of December 31, 2006 together with interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his "December 31 Balance") and/or (ii) any deferred 2006 bonus (i.e., that portion of any bonus earned in 2006 and payable in 2007 that the Participant elected to defer under this Plan) plus interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his "2006 Deferred Bonus"). As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive his Retirement Benefit in any form described in Section 5.1 and calculated under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. In addition, the Participant may elect up to two Early Payment Dates with installment payments (if any) calculated under the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method.

(b)            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has separated from service due to Retirement as of October 12, 2006, he may make a new payment election with respect to his December 31 Balance. As part of such election, the Participant may elect (1) to receive a lump sum distribution of his entire Deferral Account balance in July of 2007 or (2) to change the number of Retirement Benefit installment payments as permitted under Section 5.1, provided that the Participant may not extend the number of installments to more than twenty annual installments (including installment payments that have already been made).

(d)            In addition, as part of the special election under this Section 5.11, a Participant may change the form and manner of calculation of the payment of benefits to his Beneficiary in the event that the Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement.

(f)             Any election under this Section 5.11 must be made by November 3, 2006, or such later date as permitted by the Committee, but in no event later than December 31, 2006.

If a Participant does not timely make an election under this Section 5.11, the elections he otherwise made or makes or was deemed to make shall apply and may be changed only in accordance with the other terms of this Plan. However, any distribution election that had not become effective by October 12, 2006, shall be null and void."

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
A Committee shall be appointed by the Board to administer the Plan and establish, adopt, or revise such rules and regulations as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan and to interpret the provisions of the Plan, and, except as otherwise indicated herein, any such interpretations shall be conclusive and binding. All decisions of the Committee shall be by vote of at least two of the Committee members and shall be final. The Committee may appoint any agent and delegate to such agent such powers and duties in connection with the administration of the Plan as the Committee may from time to time prescribe.
Members of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan while serving as members of the Committee, but a member of the Committee shall not vote or act upon any matter which relates solely to such member's interest in the Plan as a Participant.
ARTICLE IV
PARTICIPATION
4.1        .
Election to Participate
(a)        . An Eligible Employee may elect to participate in the Plan and elect to defer annual Base Salary and/or Bonus under the Plan by filing with the Committee a completed and fully executed Deferral Election Form prior to the beginning of the Plan Year during which the Eligible Employee performs the services for which such Base Salary and Bonus are to be earned, or at such other time as the Committee may permit in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code. Deferral Election Forms must be filed in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Deferral Election Forms.
Deferral Elections
An employee who first becomes an Eligible Employee during a Plan Year may make an initial deferral election under this Plan within 30 days after the date the employee becomes an Eligible Employee provided that such Eligible Employee has not previously become eligible to participate in any other account balance plan of the Company as described in
 
8
 
 
Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(c)(2) or any successor regulation. Any such election shall apply to Base Salary earned for services performed after the election is filed with the Committee and to that portion of the Bonus earned during such Plan Year equal to the total amount of the Bonus multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the Plan Year after the election is filed with the Committee over the total number of days during the Plan Year that such Eligible Employee is employed by the Company.
Various deferral options will be made available to Eligible Employees under the Plan, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Committee may impose from time to time, in its complete and sole discretion. A Deferral Election Form filed for a Plan Year shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned during that Plan Year and shall remain in effect for that Plan Year and subsequent Plan Years, notwithstanding any change in the Participant's Base Salary or Bonus until changed or terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1; provided, however, that such election shall terminate as of the end of the Plan Year in which the Participant remains an employee but ceases to be an Eligible Employee. Subject to the minimum deferral requirements and maximum deferral limitations set forth below, a Participant may increase, decrease or terminate his deferral election effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus to be earned for services to be performed during any Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year.
Each Deferral Election Form will designate the DCP Deferral Amounts as a fixed dollar amount or fixed percentage (in increments of 1%) of Base Salary and/or (i) a fixed dollar amount or a fixed percentage of Bonus or (ii) 100% of any Bonus exceeding a specified dollar amount, as elected by the Participant. Deferrals of Base Salary will normally be deducted ratably during the Plan Year. In its sole discretion, the Committee may also permit amounts that an Eligible Employee has previously elected to defer under other plans or agreements with the Company to be transferred to this Plan and credited to his Deferral Accounts that are maintained hereunder.
(A)       . For each Plan Year, the minimum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is $5,000, if expressed as a dollar amount, or 5% of Base Salary, if expressed as a percentage, and the minimum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is any of the following: (I) $5,000, (II) 5% of Bonus, or (III) 100% of that portion of any Bonus that exceeds a dollar amount specified by the Participant on his Deferral Election Form.
Minimum Deferral
(B)        . For each Plan Year, the maximum amount of Base Salary that a Participant may elect to defer is 75% of Base Salary, and the maximum amount of Bonus that a Participant may elect to defer is 100% of Bonus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective with respect to amounts earned on or after January 1, 2007, for each Plan Year, the maximum total amount of Compensation that a Participant may elect to defer is $75,000 (i.e. the amount that would otherwise be paid in a Plan Year if not deferred under this Plan cannot exceed $75,000).
Maximum Deferral
(C)       . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant's total Deferral Account balance is $1,000,000 or more, then the Participant may not defer any compensation
Deferral Account Balance

earned in the following Plan Year and any election to do so shall be considered void. If as of December 31 of any Plan Year, a Participant's total Deferral Account balance is less than $1,000,000, then the Participant may defer compensation earned in the following Plan Year in accordance with this Article IV.
(b)        . With respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus earned after December 31, 2007, on the Deferral Election Form filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a), an Eligible Employee may irrevocably elect to receive the Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to that election in a lump sum payment or in annual installments over two (2) to five (5) years commencing prior to termination of employment in an Early Payment Year. If a Participant fails to designate the form of distribution for an Early Payment Benefit, the distribution shall be in the form of a lump sum. The Early Payment Year elected must be a year that begins at least two (2) years after the end of the first Plan Year to which the election applies. An Early Payment Benefit election filed for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2008, or for any subsequent Plan Year, shall be effective for Base Salary and/or Bonus earned and deferred during that Plan Year and each subsequent Plan Year until terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1; provided, however that deferrals of Base Salary or Bonus earned during any Plan Year that ends less than two (2) years prior to the Early Payment Year will not be subject to the Early Payment Benefit election and shall be paid upon the Participant's termination of employment as set forth in Section  5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be. A Participant may terminate an election for an Early Payment Benefit with respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred in any future Plan Year by filing a new Deferral Election Form with the Committee prior to January 1 of such Plan Year. A Participant may not, however, change the form of benefit or time of commencement of an Early Payment Benefit with respect to Base Salary and/or Bonus deferred pursuant to a Deferral Election Form after that Deferral Election is filed pursuant to Section 4.1(a).
Early Payment Benefit Election
A Participant may not at any time have Early Payment Benefits scheduled for more than two Early Payment Years. However, after an Early Payment Year has occurred and all payments with respect to the corresponding Early Payment Year election have been completed, a Participant may elect a new Early Payment Year for future deferrals of Base Salary and/or Bonuses.
(c)        . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the cash portion (if any) subject to a deferral election under a Qualifying Performance Stock Award that was granted before December 31, 2006 but becomes vested on or after December 31, 2006 shall be credited to the Eligible Employee's DCP Deferral Account as a Performance Award Cash Deferral unless the Participant elected, pursuant to transition rules under Section 409A of the Code, to receive distribution of the cash portion of the Qualifying Performance Stock Award in 2008. Any cash portion of a Qualifying Performance Stock that becomes vested on or after December 31, 2006 and payable in 2008 pursuant to an election as described herein, shall be credited to a special subaccount of the Participant's DCP Deferral Account and distributed in a lump sum during the first seventy-five (75) days of 2008.
Deferral of Performance Award Cash Payments
4.2        . The Committee shall establish and maintain a separate DCP Deferral Account for each Participant. A DCP Deferral Amount shall be credited by the
DCP Deferral Accounts
 
10
 
 
Company to the Participant's DCP Deferral Account as of the date that the Participant's Base Salary and/or Bonus would otherwise have been paid. The amount of a Participant's Performance Award Cash Deferral shall be credited to a Participant's DCP Deferral Account as of the date it becomes certified for payment. Such DCP Deferral Account shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment. The Committee shall establish an Early Payment Year Subaccount within a Participant's DCP Deferral Account for each Early Payment Year elected by that Participant. Any such Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be debited by the amount of any Early Payment Benefit paid by the Company to the Participant in such Early Payment Year pursuant to Section 5.4 as of the date o f payment.
4.3        . The Committee shall maintain a separate SEDCP Deferral Account for each Participant who was a participant in the SEDCP on December 31, 1998. The balance of such Participant's accounts under the SEDCP as of December 31, 1998 remained credited to each such Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan, a predecessor to this Plan, as of January 1, 1999. SEDCP Deferral Accounts shall be debited by the amount of any payments made by the Company to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary therefrom as of the date of payment.
SEDCP Deferral Accounts
4.4        . Each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the Declared Rate for each Plan Year, compounded monthly. Except as provided in Section 5.2(a), with respect to SEDCP Deferral Accounts for Participants who die prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, interest will be credited to each Deferral Account on a monthly basis on the last day of each month as long as any amount remains credited to such Deferral Account. Amounts of deferred Compensation that are credited to a DCP Deferral Account and amounts of Savings Plan Restoration Contributions that are credited to a Savings Plan Restoration Account prior to the end of a calendar month shall accrue interest from the date of crediting, computed on the basis of a 30-day month based on days elapsed from date of crediting to the end of the month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective January 1, 2009, each Deferral Account of a Participant shall be deemed to bear interest on the monthly balance of such Deferral Account at the annualized Declared Rate for the month. Such interest shall be credited to the Participant's Deferral Account balance as of the last day of the month and shall be determined by multiplying the Deferral Account balance as of the end of the preceding month times the annualized Declared Rate for the current month.
Interest
4.5        . The value of a Deferral Account as of any date shall equal the amounts previously credited to such Deferral Account less any payments debited to such Deferral Account plus the interest deemed to be earned on such Deferral Account in accordance with Section 4.4 through the end of the preceding month. When payments are made from a DCP Deferral Account for any reason other than an Early Payment Benefit elected after January 1, 1994, such payments shall be deemed to be made on a proportionate or pro-rata basis from DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred under the 1988 DCP prior to January 1, 1994, and DCP Deferral Amounts (including accumulated interest thereon) that were earned and deferred after that date.

4.6        .
Savings Plan Restoration Contribution
(a)        . For each Plan Year, the Company shall credit to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of any Participant, an amount equal to the amount by which the contribution that would otherwise have been made by the Company on behalf of the Participant to the Savings Plan for such Plan Year is reduced by reason of the reduction in the Participant's Base Salary for such Plan Year because of deferrals under this Plan. The Savings Plan Restoration Contribution shall be credited to the Savings Plan Restoration Account of each Participant for each Plan Year at the same time as the Company contribution for such Plan Year is made to the Savings Plan. A Participant's interest in any credit to his Savings Plan Restoration Account and earnings thereon shall vest at the same rate and at the same time as would have been the case had such contribution been made to the Savings Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, upon a Participant's termination of employment, the Participant has not or does not become 100% vested in his Savings Plan Restoration Account, the unvested portion of his Savings Plan Restoration Account shall be forfeited prior to the determination of the amount of any benefits under Sections 5.1, 5.5, or 5.6.
General Rule
(b)        . Effective as of January 1, 2005, that portion of a Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account under the Prior Plan that was not vested as of December 31, 2004, was transferred to and credited to such Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account under the 2005 DCP and is governed by the terms of this Plan, including any Distribution Election Form filed under the 2005 DCP on or before December 31, 2005. If the Participant was not participating in the 2005 DCP in 2005, the Participant could nevertheless make an election in accordance with Section 5.1(b) and 5.2 of the 2005 DCP if such election was made by December 31, 2005. If the Participant did not file a Distribution Election Form on or before December 31, 2005, with respect to such amount, together with interest the Participant was deemed to have made an election to receive distribution in accordance with Section 5.1(a).
Transfer of Non-Vested Savings Plan Restoration Account from Prior Plan
4.7        . The Committee shall submit to each Participant, within 120 days after the close of each Plan Year, a statement in such form as the Committee deems desirable, setting forth the Participant's Deferral Account(s).

2004 Bonuses
(a)        . Any Bonus that was payable in 2005 to an employee of the Company for services performed during 2004 (a "2004 Bonus") and that such individual elected to defer in accordance with the terms of the Prior Plan was deferred under the 2005 DCP instead of the Prior Plan. Any such 2004 Bonus was credited to the individual's DCP Deferral Account as set forth in Section 4.2 and is subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, including, without limitation, any distribution election made under Article V; provided, however, that if such individual did not file a Distribution Election Form under the 2005 DCP as provided in Section 5.1(b) at the time such 2004 Bonus was credited to his DCP Deferral Account, he could file a Distribution Election Form at any time prior to February 11, 2005, which then became applicable with respect to his 2004 Bonus and any other Compensation deferred and credited to the Participant's DCP Deferral Account under this Plan.

(b)        . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any participant in the Prior Plan who elected to defer his 2004 Bonus could revoke his deferral election as provided in this Section 4.8(b). Such election had to be in writing on a form provided by the Committee and had to be filed with the Committee on or before January 21, 2005. Any participant in the Prior Plan who revoked his 2004 Bonus deferral election as provided herein received his 2004 Bonus in cash at or about the same time that 2004 Bonuses were paid to other employees of the Company.
Opportunity to Revoke Deferral Election
4.9        . Any payment elections made or deemed to be made by a Participant under the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP and in effect immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006 shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless and until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The Committee shall establish and maintain separate subaccounts for each Deferral Account as may be necessary to account for amounts subject to different payout elections.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.1, upon a Participant's termination of employment for a reason other than death (including Retirement and Disability), the Company shall pay to the Participant in a single lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the Participant's termination of employment an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment (after reduction for any forfeitures as set forth in Section 4.6). Any Retirement Benefit paid in annual installments pursuant to Section 5.1(b) shall be paid within the first 90 days of each calendar year, beginning with the year following the Participant's Retirement and shall be determined based on the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the last day of the month preceding payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that a Participant who is a Specified Employee is entitled to a distribution from the Plan upon or by virtue of such Participant's termination of employment for a reason other than death or Disability, the lump sum payment or the first annual installment payment, as the case may be, shall not be paid before the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's termination of employment (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). Any additional installment payments shall be paid within the first 90 days of each subsequent calendar year.
Form and Time of Benefit
(b)        . (i) On a Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that a Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, a Participant (A) may elect to have the Retirement Benefit, which may consist solely of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account, paid to him in a lump sum, annual payments for any other number of years between two (2) and 20 years or, if available as an option on the Distribution Election Form provided to the Participant, in a combination of an initial lump sum payment followed by annual installments over the next one (1) to 20 years, and (B) may elect to have the amount of each
Retirement
 
13
 
 
annual installment determined under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. If a Participant fails to elect either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method, such Participant shall be deemed to have elected the Fractional Method.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an election to receive distribution in a series of annual installments or as a combination of a lump sum followed by annual installments shall be treated as a single payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
(iii) Subject to Section 5.1(b)(iv), a Participant may change his election as to the form of Retirement distribution under this Program subject to the following conditions: (A) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee; (B) the election must defer the lump sum payment or the initial amount of an installment payment for a period of at least five (5) years from the date that the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, was otherwise payable; and (C) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made.
(iv) A Participant may only make two changes pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(iii). Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of Section 5.1(b)(iii).
(c)        . If a Participant's employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, then the Participant shall receive a Termination Benefit in a lump sum as provided in Section 5.1(a).
Termination Prior to Retirement
(d)        . If a Participant ceases to perform services for the Company prior to Retirement due to a Disability, then the Participant shall receive a Disability Benefit in a lump sum within the first 90 days of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 55 in an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
Disability Benefit
(e)        . Spousal survivor benefits (if any) under Section 5.3 of the Plan shall not be payable to the spouse of a Participant who terminates employment prior to Retirement and receives a Termination Benefit or a Disability Benefit under this Section 5.1.
Effect of Pre-Retirement Termination of Employment on Spousal Survivor Benefits
(a)        If a Participant dies while employed by the Company, or after termination of employment with the Company but before payment of, or commencement of installment payments of, his benefits under the Plan, then the Company will pay to the Participant's Beneficiary in a single lump sum a Beneficiary Benefit that is an amount equal to the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts (other than his or her SEDCP Deferral Account (if any)). If such Participant also has an SEDCP Deferral Account, the Company will also pay to the Participant's Beneficiary annual payments over the greater of (i) 10 years or (ii) until the Participant would have attained age 65 equal to 25% of the amount deferred under the SEDCP
 
14
 
 
(excluding any interest on such deferrals), which payments shall be in full satisfaction of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant's Beneficiary shall instead be paid the amount credited to the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account as of the end of the month in which his death occurred plus interest at a rate of 8% per annum, compounded annually, from the end of such month and credited annually on each anniversary of the end of such month payable in equal installments (using the Amortization method) over the period described in the preceding sentence, if the Committee determines that the present value of such benefit is greater than the present value of the benefit described in the preceding sentence. In comparing the present value of these two alternative benefits, the Committee shall use in each case a discount factor of 8%..
(b)        If a Participant dies after the commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit, then the remaining installments (if any) of the Retirement Benefit shall be payable to his Beneficiary in the same amounts and at the same times as such installment would have been paid to the Participant if he were living.
(c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, a Participant may elect, on a Distribution Election Form filed simultaneously with and in the same manner as the first Deferral Election Form that the Participant is required to file in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1 hereof, that, if he dies prior to the commencement of his Retirement Benefits, then the payment to his Beneficiary shall be made in any form and calculated in any other manner described in Section 5.1(b). A Participant may change his election as to the form of payment to his Beneficiary subject to the following conditions: (1) the election shall not be effective until twelve (12) months after the election is filed with the Committee and (2) the election must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the lump sum payment or initial amount of the installment payment, as the case may be, would have been payable if no change as to the form of distribution were ever made. Each such change must satisfy all of the requirements of this Section 5.2(c).
(d)        The payment or payments to a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant under this Section 5.2 shall be made or commence during the first 90 days of the calendar year following the year in which the Participant's death occurred, and the amount of such payment shall be equal to, or determined based on, the value of the Participant's Deferral Accounts as of the end of the month preceding payment.
(e)        In the event that the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant dies prior to the completion of payments under this Plan to that Beneficiary, all remaining payments to that Beneficiary shall be paid in a lump sum to that Beneficiary's estate.
(f)         Any election as to the form and manner of payment to a Beneficiary in effect under the terms of the DCP2 or the 2005 DCP immediately prior to the merger of the two plans on December 31, 2006, shall remain in effect with respect to the portions of the applicable Deferral Accounts attributable to amounts deferred under each plan and shall continue in effect unless or until changed in accordance with the terms of this Plan.

If a Participant who has an SEDCP Deferral Account dies after becoming eligible for Retirement or after commencement of payment of his Retirement Benefit and a spouse to whom he had been married to for at least one (1) year prior to his death survives beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance, the Company shall pay such spouse a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 10% of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance valued as of the earlier of the date of the Participant's Retirement or death. Such lump sum spousal survivor benefit shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the later of the completion of payment of the Participan t's SEDCP Deferral Account balance or the Participant's death. No benefit shall be payable under this Section 5.3 if the Participant's spouse does not survive beyond completion of payment of the Participant's SEDCP Deferral Account balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no spousal survivor benefit shall be payable to the spouse of any Participant who received benefits pursuant to Section 5.1(c) (Termination Benefit), Section 5.1(d) (Disability Benefit) or Section 5.6 (Immediate Payment on Termination Event).

Payment of the amounts credited to any Early Payment Year Subaccount of a Participant shall be paid or commence to be paid within the first 90 days of the year elected as the Early Payment Year in accordance with the Participant's election under Section 4.1(b), with any subsequent annual payments paid in the first 90 days of each applicable year. The amount of each annual installment will be determined under the Fractional Method unless the Participant otherwise irrevocably elects the Amortization Method at the time of making the Early Payment Benefit election.
Early Payment
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant terminates employment with the Company for any reason prior to commencement or completion of an Early Payment Benefit, the election made by the Participant to receive the Early Payment Benefit shall terminate and the amount credited to the Participant's Early Payment Year Subaccount shall be paid, together with the other amounts credited to the Participant's Deferral Account, as set forth in Section 5.1 or 5.2, as the case may be.
5.5        . In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, an Emergency Benefit that does not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship and the additional compensation available to the Participant upon the termination of the Participant's current deferral elections under the Plan, as described in the following paragraph of this Section 5.5. No amount may be paid to the Participant under this Section 5.5 from any unvested portion of the Participant's Savings Plan Restoration Account.
Emergency Benefit
Whenever a Participant receives a distribution under this Section 5.5, the Participant will be deemed to have revoked all current deferral elections under the Plan effective as of the date of the distribution. The Participant will not be permitted to participate in the next

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that the value of a Participant's Deferral Accounts, as of the end of the Plan Year in which the Participant's Retirement occurs is less than $20,000 (after reduction for any forfeiture pursuant to Section 4.6), then such amount (with interest to the end of the month preceding the payment date) shall be paid in a cash lump sum without regard to any contrary elections. Such payment shall be made at the time set forth in Section 5.1(a) unless a different distribution date is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
Small Benefit
5.8        .
Tax Withholding and Reporting
(a)        To the extent required by the law in effect at the time payments are made, the Company shall withhold from payments made hereunder the taxes required to be withheld by Federal, state and local law.
(b)        The Company shall have the right at its option to (i) require a Participant to pay or provide for payment of the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts or (ii) deduct from any amount of salary, bonus or other payment otherwise payable in cash to the Participant the amount of any taxes that the Company may be required to withhold with respect to interest or other amounts that the Company credits to a Participant's Deferral Accounts.
(c)        The tax withholding and reporting rules described in this subsection shall apply to payments made under the Plan pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order, shall be subject to any applicable superseding guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, and shall apply in addition to (not in substitution of) the preceding two subsections. Amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to federal income tax withholding and, together with amounts so withheld, shall be reportable to the Alternate Payee. In addition, amounts paid to an Alternate Payee shall be subject to taxation under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ("FUTA") to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid to the Participant. To the extent that amounts paid to an Alternate Payee are subject to taxation under FICA and/or FUTA, such payments shall be treated as the wages of the Participant, and shall be so reportable, but any amounts required under FICA to be withheld from such payments shall be withheld from the payments to the Alternate Payee.

5.9        . For the purpose of this Article V, a Participant will be deemed to have terminated employment if the Participant ceases to be an employee of any of the following:
Termination of Employment
(a)        Occidental Petroleum Corporation;
(b)        an Affiliate; or
(c)        any other entity, whether or not incorporated, in which the Company has an ownership interest, and the Committee has designated that the Participant's commencement of employment with such entity upon Participant's ceasing to be an employee of an entity described in (a) or (b) above will not be deemed to be a termination of employment for purposes of this Plan, provided that such designation shall be made in writing by the Committee and shall be communicated to the Participant prior to his commencement of employment with the entity so designated.
For the purposes of the preceding provisions, a Participant who ceases to be an employee of an entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above shall not be deemed to have terminated employment if such cessation of employment is followed immediately by his commencement of employment with another entity described in (a), (b) or (c) above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for any purpose under this Plan unless such termination of employment constitutes "a separation from service" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or any regulations promulgated thereunder.
5.10      . If a Participant's employment with the Company is terminated and such Participant is re-employed by the Company prior to the payment of his benefits in a cash lump sum payment or while he is receiving benefits in the form of annual installment payments, the payment of the lump sum amount or the future installments, as the case may be, shall be suspended until he again terminates employment with the Company. Such Participant may elect to again participate in this Plan and to defer additional Base Salary and/or Bonus as provided in Section 4.1. Upon a Participant's subsequent termination of employment, distribution of his benefits under the Plan shall commence or resume in the same form as the benefits were payable at his earlier termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.10 shall only apply to the extent it does not violate Section 409A of the Code.
Re-Employment
5.11      . Subject to the policies and procedures established by the Committee under Section 9.3(b) hereof and the provisions of this Plan, benefits may be paid from the balance of a Participant's Deferral Account(s) in accordance with a Qualified Divorce Order.

Special Transition Rule Election
(a)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, pursuant to the transition rules under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder, each Participant who has not separated from service as of October 12, 2006 may make a new payment election (a "Special Transition Rule Election") with respect to (i) the balance of his Deferral
 
18
 
 
Accounts as of December 31, 2006 together with interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his "December 31 Balance") and/or (ii) any deferred 2006 bonus (i.e., that portion of any bonus earned in 2006 and payable in 2007 that the Participant elected to defer under this Plan) plus interest credited thereto prior to distribution (his "2006 Deferred Bonus"). As part of such election, the Participant may elect to receive his Retirement Benefit in any form described in Section 5.1 and calculated under either the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. In addition, the Participant may elect up to two Early Payment Years with installment payments (if any) calculated under the Amortization Method or the Fractional Method. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1(b) or Section 5.4 to the contrary, a Participant may elect any Early Payme nt Year other than 2006 regardless of the year in which the Compensation was deferred, except that (i) the earliest Early Payment Year that a Participant may elect with respect to his 2006 Deferred Bonus is 2008, and (ii) if a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year with respect to his December 31 Balance, payment will be made in July of 2007. A Participant may elect that all, any portion or no portion of his December 31 Balance and/or all, any portion or no portion of his 2006 Deferred Bonus be paid in an Early Payment Year, but (i) the Participant may not select more than two Early Payment Years under this Special Transition Rule Election and may not elect any additional Early Payment Years under Section 4.1(b) if such election would result in more than two scheduled Early Payment Years and (ii) the Participant may not make different elections with respect to the form or manner of calculation of his Retirement Benefit with respect to his December 31 Balance and his 2006 Deferred Bonus.
(b)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Participant has separated from service due to Retirement as of October 12, 2006, he may make a new payment election with respect to his December 31 Balance. As part of such election, the Participant may elect (1) to receive a lump sum distribution of his entire Deferral Account balance in July of 2007 or (2) to change the number of Retirement Benefit installment payments as permitted under Section 5.1, provided that the Participant may not extend the number of installments to more than twenty annual installments (including installment payments that have already been made).
(c)  If a Participant elects 2007 as an Early Payment Year for his December 31 Balance, he may not elect to defer any Compensation earned in 2007 under this Plan.
(d)  In addition, as part of the special election under this Section 5.12, a Participant may change the form and manner of calculation of the payment of benefits to his Beneficiary in the event that the Participant dies while employed by the Company after becoming eligible for Retirement.
(e)  A Participant must elect the same form and manner of calculating his Retirement Benefit under (a) or (b) of this Section 5.12 and the same form and manner of calculating his Beneficiary Benefit under (d) of this Section 5.12 as he elects for such benefits under the 2005 DCP and the DCP2.
(f)   Any election under this Section 5.12 must be made by November 3, 2006, or such later date as permitted by the Committee, but in no event later than December 31, 2006.
(g)  A Participant's election under this Section 5.12 shall supersede any previous election made or deemed to be made under this Plan, the 2005 DCP, or the DCP2. If a
 
19
 
 
Participant does not timely make an election under this Section 5.12, the elections he otherwise made or makes or was deemed to make shall apply and may be changed only in accordance with the other terms of this Plan and any Compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2007, shall be subject to the Participant's election under the 2005 DCP (or, the DCP2 if the Participant was a participant in the DCP2 but not the 2005 DCP) or as subsequently amended in accordance with the other terms of this Plan. However, any distribution election that had not become effective by October 12, 2006, shall be null and void.
ARTICLE VI
BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION
Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as the Beneficiary to whom payments under this Plan shall be made in the event of the Participant's death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime on a paper form prescribed by the Committee. Any Beneficiary designation made by a Participant under the DCP2 and/or the 2005 DCP shall continue to apply under this Plan until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Participant had selected different Beneficiaries under the DCP2 and the 2005 DCP, the following rules shall apply:
(A)      If the Participant does not make a new election under Section 5.12, the Beneficiary designation under the DCP2 shall apply to the subaccount for the DCP2 under this Plan and the Beneficiary designation under the 2005 DCP shall apply to the subaccount for the 2005 DCP under this Plan unless or until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation form with the Committee.
(B)       If the Participant does make a new election under Section 5.12, the Participant will be treated as having no Beneficiary designation on file until the Participant files a new Beneficiary designation with the Committee.
The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form will cancel any inconsistent Beneficiary designation previously filed.
If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, any benefits remaining unpaid shall be paid in accordance with the Participant's Beneficiary designation under the Company's Retirement Plan, and if there is no such valid Beneficiary designation, to the Participant's then surviving spouse, or if none, to the Participant's estate, unless directed otherwise by the court that has jurisdiction over the assets belonging to the Participant's probate estate.

ARTICLE VIII
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PLAN
8.1        . The Board may amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, tax, accounting or other changes, which may result in termination of the Plan for future deferrals. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board may amend the Plan to (a) ensure that this Plan complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code for deferral of taxation on compensation deferred hereunder until the time of distribution and (b) add provisions for changes to deferral elections and elections as to time and manner of distributions and other changes that comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code for the deferral of taxation on deferred compensation until the time of distribution. The Committee appointed pursuant to Article III, in its discretion, may amend the Plan if the Committee determines that such amendment does not significantly increase or decrease Plan benefits or costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for any amendment required to preserve the deferral of taxation of amounts deferred under this Plan, no amendment shall (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted; (b) eliminate the spousal survivor benefit under Section 5.3; or (c) change the definition of the Declared Rate set forth in Article II for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted, produces a rate that is less than the lesser of: (i) Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted), or (ii) the highest yield on any unsecured debt or preferred stock of the Company that was outstanding on the last day of the month immediately preceding the date such amendment is adopted. Any amendment that would either (a) reduce the Declared Rate for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted, produces a rate that is less than Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date such amendment is adopted) or (b) change the terms of the amendment provisions of this Section 8.1 or the terms of the termination provisions of Section 8.2, shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date such amendment is adopted, unless the amendment is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or the amendment is required in order to preclude any amounts deferred under this Plan from being included in the income of Participants prior to a date of distribution as specified under this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Termination Event, no amendment shall (a) reduce the amounts that have been credited to the Deferral Account(s) of any Participant prior to the date such amendment is adopted; (b) change the definition of the Declared Rate set forth in Article II for the Plan Years beginning on January 1 of 2006, 2007, or 2008 to a rate or to a formula that, as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the Termination Event, produces a rate that is less than Moodys Plus Three (as defined in Article II and calculated as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the Termination Event); (c) eliminate the spousal survivor benefits under Section 5.3; or (d) change the terms of the amendment provisions of this Section 8.1 or the terms of the termination provisions of Section 8.2.

8.2        .
Termination
(a)        . The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, if in the Board's judgment, the continuance of the Plan would not be in the Company's best interest due to tax, accounting or other effects thereof, or potential payouts thereunder, or other reasons, provided that any termination of the Plan shall not be effective prior to the date that is two years after the date the Board adopts a resolution to terminate the Plan, unless (i) the termination of the Plan is required by a change in the tax or other applicable laws or accounting rules, or (ii) the Participants have become subject to tax on the amounts deferred under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Termination Event, the Plan may not be terminated prior to the date that is three years after the date the Termination Event occurs, or, if earlier, the date on which amounts deferred under the Plan have become taxable to Participants. In the event the Board adopts a resolution terminating the Plan, the Board or the Committee shall determine the date as of which all deferral elections shall cease to apply so that no further Base Salary, Bonuses or Performance Award Cash Deferrals shall be deferred under the Plan.
Company's Right to Terminate
(b)        . Distributions to the Participants or their Beneficiaries shall be made on the dates on which the Participants or their Beneficiaries would receive benefits hereunder without regard to the termination of the Plan except that payments will be made upon termination if one of the following requirements is satisfied:
Payments Upon Termination
(A)        the Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 5.5 of the Plan,
(B)        the termination of the Plan otherwise satisfies one of the requirements for accelerated payment under Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(h)(2)(viii) (or a successor regulation) or other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, or
(C)        the Plan is terminated because the Participants have become subject to tax on the amounts deferred under the Plan because of a failure of the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS
9.1        . The rights of a Participant, Beneficiary, or their heirs, successors, and assigns, as relates to any Company promises hereunder, shall not be secured by any specific assets of the Company, nor shall any assets of the Company be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction of such promises.
Unsecured General Creditor
9.2        . The Company shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the Plan. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board or Committee may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.

No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.
(b)        Notwithstanding subsection (a), the right to benefits payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order may be created, assigned, or recognized. The Committee shall establish appropriate policies and procedures to determine whether a Divorce Order presented to the Committee constitutes a Qualified Divorce Order under this Plan, and to administer distributions pursuant to the terms of Qualified Divorce Orders. In the event that a Qualified Divorce Order exists with respect to benefits payable under the Plan, such benefits otherwise payable to the Participant specified in the Qualified Divorce Order shall be payable to the Alternate Payee specified in such Qualified Divorce Order.
9.4        . A Participant's right to receive benefits under the Plan shall be reduced to the extent that any portion of a Participant's Deferral Account(s) has been paid or set side for payment to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Divorce Order or to the extent that the Company or the Plan is otherwise subject to a binding judgment, decree, or order for the attachment, garnishment or execution of any portion of the Participant's Deferral Account(s) or of any distributions therefrom. The Participant shall be deemed to have released the Company and the Plan from any claim with respect to such amounts in any case in which (a) the Company, the Plan, or any Plan representative has been served with legal process or otherwise joined in a proceeding relating to such amounts, and (b) the Participant fails to obtain an order of the court in the proceeding relieving the Company and the Plan from the obligation to comply with the judgment, decree or order.
Release from Liability to Participant
9.5        . Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as a contract of employment or as giving any Participant any right to be retained in employment with the Company. Accordingly, subject to the terms of any written employment agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to terminate or change the terms of employment of a Participant at any time and for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Employment Not Guaranteed
9.6        . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine or feminine as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may be read as the plural and the plural as the singular.
Gender, Singular & Plural
9.7        . The captions of the articles, sections, and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

9.9        . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the principal office of the Company.

9.10      . The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
