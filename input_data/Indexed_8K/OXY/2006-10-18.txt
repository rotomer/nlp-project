Other Events
 
On October 18, 2006, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced core earnings for the third quarter 2006 were $1.159 billion ($1.35 per diluted share), compared with $1.004 billion ($1.22 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.

The third quarter 2005 core income of $1.004 billion excludes a $463 million after-tax gain resulting from the sale of an equity investment, a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $98 million after-tax charge from the write-off of certain chemical plants.
 
QUARTERLY RESULTS
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.877 billion for the third quarter 2006, a 15 percent increase from the $1.638 billion segment earnings for the third quarter 2005. The improvement in the third quarter 2006 earnings reflected a $273 million increase from higher worldwide crude oil prices, a $141 million increase from higher production, partially offset by higher operating expenses, increased DD&A rates, and higher exploration expense.
 
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the third quarter 2006 was $70.53 per barrel compared to $63.19 per barrel in the third quarter 2005. Occidental's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $60.52 per barrel for the third quarter 2006, compared with $55.97 per barrel for the third quarter 2005. The average price for NYMEX gas in the third quarter 2006 was $6.33 per MMCF, compared with $7.09 per MMCF in the third quarter 2005. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $6.33 per MMCF in the third quarter 2005 to $5.88 per MMCF for the third quarter 2006.
 
Production
 
For the third quarter, oil and gas daily production from continuing operations averaged 587,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), a 71,000 BOE increase over the 516,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the third quarter 2005.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical third quarter 2006 core earnings were $247 million and third quarter 2005 core earnings were $167 million, after excluding charges for write-off of plants and hurricane related insurance charges. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of segment earnings to core earnings. The improvement in the third quarter 2006 results was due to increased chlor-alkali volumes and higher margins in all chlorovinyls products. Chemical segment earnings were $247 million for the third quarter 2006, compared with $3 million for the third quarter 2005.
 
NINE-MONTHS RESULTS
 
Core earnings were $3.514 billion ($4.07 per diluted share) for the first nine months of 2006, compared with $2.616 billion ($3.20 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
 
For the first nine months of 2006, net income was $3.254 billion ($3.77 per diluted share), compared with $4.129 billion ($5.06 per diluted share) for the first nine months of 2005.
 
Oil and Gas
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $5.740 billion for the first nine months of 2006, a 38 percent increase over the $4.172 billion segment earnings for the first nine months of 2005. The improvement in the nine months 2006 earnings was due to record crude oil and higher natural gas prices and higher production, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates.
 
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the first nine months of 2006 was $68.24 per barrel compared to $55.40 per barrel in the nine months of 2005. Occidental's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $58.41 per barrel for the nine months of 2006, compared with $48.24 per barrel for the same period in 2005. The average price for NYMEX gas in the nine months of 2006 was $8.34 per MMCF, compared with $6.93 per MMCF in the nine months of 2005. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $6.16 per MMCF in the nine months of 2005 to $6.80 per MMCF for the nine months of 2006.
 
Production
 
Worldwide daily production from continuing operations for the nine months of 2006 averaged 596,000 BOE, compared with 519,000 BOE for the nine months of 2005. The increase included eight months of Vintage production at 59,000 BOE per day, which added 53,000 BOE per day to Occidental's year-to-date production and a Libyan increase of 18,000 BOE per day, which reflects nine months production in 2006, compared with one month in 2005.
 
Chemicals
 
Chemical core earnings for the first nine months of 2006 were $745 million, compared with $606 million for the same period of 2005, after excluding the same charges discussed in the third quarter analysis above. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of segment earnings to core earnings. The improvement in the nine months 2006 results was due to higher chlor-alkali volumes and higher margins in all chlorovinyl products. Chemical segment earnings were $745 million for the first nine months of 2006, compared with $442 million for the same 2005 period.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
 
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The following tables set forth the core earnings and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate:

For Immediate Release: October 18, 2006
Occidental Petroleum Announces Third Quarter Earnings
LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced core earnings for the third quarter 2006 were $1.159 billion ($1.35 per diluted share), compared with $1.004 billion ($1.22 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
Net income for the third quarter 2006 was $1.168 billion ($1.36 per diluted share), compared with $1.747 billion ($2.12 per diluted share) for the third quarter 2005.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our continuing focus on expanding and strengthening operations in our core businesses was a key factor in the 15 percent increase in our core earnings compared to last year's third quarter results. Our success in growing combined oil and gas production by 14 percent compared to the same period a year ago, along with sharply higher crude oil prices and a strong performance from our chemicals business, were key drivers in our financial performance for the quarter. Oil and gas production averaged 587,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter and an all-time high for nine months of 596,000 equivalent barrels per day. Strong production growth and robust energy prices helped propel Oil and Gas segment earnings to an historic nine month high. In addition, our Chemical segment's earnings were the highest for any nine month period in more than a decade."
The third quarter 2005 core income of $1.004 billion excludes a $463 million after-tax gain resulting from the sale of an equity investment, a $335 million tax benefit due to the
 
reversal of tax reserves no longer required and a $98 million after-tax charge from the write-off of certain chemical plants.

 Conference Call 
Third Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
 
October 18, 2006
Los Angeles, California
 
Core income for the third quarter was $1.159 billion, or $1.35 per diluted share. That represents an increase of 15 percent compared to last year's third quarter. Last year's third quarter excludes a $463 million after-tax gain from the sale of an equity investment, a $335 million tax benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required and a $98 million after-tax charge for the write-off of certain chemical assets.
Net income for the third quarter was $1.168 billion, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared to $1.747 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share, in last year's third quarter.
Our strong performance was driven by three items - higher oil prices, higher combined oil and gas volumes and improved chemical earnings.
Here's the segment breakdown for the
third quarter.

Third Quarter 2006 Earnings - 4Q06 Outlook
Oil and Gas production of 610 to 620 mboe/day
9 mboe/day from recently acquired Plains properties; due to gas sales lag we will report approx. 7 mboe/day for 4Q.
Two Libyan liftings scheduled total of 2 million barrels = 24 mboe/day.   
Commodity prices
$1 per bbl change in oil prices impacts Oil & Gas earnings by approx. $38 mm in 4Q before foreign income taxes (after-tax impact of $22 mm).  
25-cents per mmBtu change in gas prices impacts quarterly segment earnings by $12 mm.   
Realized Domestic Natural Gas price of $5.20 per mcf
Reduce Oil & Gas segment income by $32 mm vs. 3Q06.  
Exploration Expense of about $100 mm due to higher drilling and seismic activity largely related to Libya.
