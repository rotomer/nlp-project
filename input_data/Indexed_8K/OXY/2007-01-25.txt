Item 8.01.
Other Events
On January 25, 2007, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced core earnings were a record $4.349 billion ($5.05 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006, compared with $3.732 billion ($4.56 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings. For the twelve months of 2006, net income was $4.182 billion ($4.86 per diluted share), compared with $5.281 billion ($6.45 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2005.
Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 was $928 million ($1.09 per diluted share), compared with $1.152 billion ($1.40 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2005. Core earnings for the fourth quarter 2006 were $835 million ($0.98 per diluted share), compared with $1.116 billion ($1.36 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
The fourth quarter 2006 core income of $835 million excludes an $89 million after-tax gain for litigation settlements, a $57 million after-tax gain resulting from the sale of 10 million shares of our investment in Lyondell Chemical Company, a $20 million after-tax charge for the purchase of debt on the open market, and a $40 million non-cash tax charge resulting from changes in compensation programs.
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.499 billion for the fourth quarter 2006, a 17-percent decrease from the $1.796 billion segment earnings for the fourth quarter 2005. The decline in the fourth quarter 2006 earnings reflected a $276 million decrease from lower natural gas prices, higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates, partially offset by higher production.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the fourth quarter 2006 was $60.20 per barrel compared to $60.02 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2005. Occidental's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $51.18 per barrel for the fourth quarter 2006, compared with $51.87 per barrel for the fourth quarter 2005. The average price for NYMEX gas in the fourth quarter 2006 was $6.27 per MCF, compared with $11.66 per MCF in the fourth quarter 2005. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.81 per MCF in the fourth quarter 2005 to $5.64 per MCF for the fourth quarter 2006.
Production
For the fourth quarter, daily oil and gas production from continuing operations averaged 616,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), a 70,000 BOE increase over the 546,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the fourth quarter 2005. The acquisitions of Vintage and certain properties from Plains accounted for 56,000 and 6,000 BOE, respectively, of this fourth quarter increase with Oman and Colombia providing the balance.
Chemicals
Chemical fourth quarter 2006 segment earnings were $156 million, compared with fourth quarter 2005 segment earnings of $165 million. The fourth quarter 2006 decline resulted from lower volumes.
TWELVE-MONTH RESULTS
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $7.239 billion for the twelve months of 2006, a 21-percent increase over the $5.968 billion segment earnings for the twelve months of 2005. The improvement in the twelve month 2006 earnings was due to record crude oil prices and higher production, partially offset by higher operating expenses, increased DD&A rates, and lower natural gas prices.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the twelve months of 2006 was $66.23 per barrel compared to $56.56 per barrel in the twelve months of 2005. Occidental's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $56.57 per barrel for the twelve months of 2006, compared with $49.18 per barrel for the same period in 2005. The average price for NYMEX gas in the twelve months of 2006 was $7.82 per MCF, compared with $8.11 per MCF in the twelve months of 2005. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $7.11 per MCF in the twelve months of 2005 to $6.51 per MCF for the twelve months of 2006.
Production
Worldwide daily production from continuing operations for the twelve months of 2006 averaged 601,000 BOE, compared with 526,000 BOE for the twelve months of 2005. The increase included eleven months of Vintage production at 58,000 BOE per day, which added 53,000 BOE per day to Occidental's total year production and a Libyan increase of 15,000 BOE per day, which reflects twelve months of production in 2006, compared with four months in 2005.
Chemicals
Chemical core earnings for the twelve months of 2006 were $901 million, compared with $777 million for the same period of 2005, after excluding charges for the write-off of plants and hurricane related insurance charges. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of segment earnings to core earnings. The improvement in the twelve month 2006 results was due to higher margins in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride. Chemical segment earnings were $901 million for the twelve months of 2006, compared with $607 million for the same 2005 period.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings", which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings. For the twelve months of 2006, net income was $4.182 billion ($4.86 per diluted share), compared with $5.281 billion ($6.45 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2005.
Net income for the fourth quarter 2006 was $928 million ($1.09 per diluted share), compared with $1.152 billion ($1.40 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2005. Core earnings for the fourth quarter 2006 were $835 million ($0.98 per diluted share), compared with $1.116 billion ($1.36 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core earnings.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Oil and gas production averaged 616,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter and a record high for the year of 601,000 equivalent barrels per day. Strong production growth and higher energy prices helped propel Oil and Gas 2006 segment earnings for the year to a historic annual record high. In addition, our Chemical segment's annual earnings were the highest in more than a decade."
The fourth quarter 2006 core income of $835 million excludes an $89 million after-tax gain for litigation settlements, a $57 million after-tax gain resulting from the sale of 10 million shares of our investment in Lyondell Chemical
Company, a $20 million after-tax charge for the purchase of debt on the open market, and a $40 million non-cash tax charge resulting from changes in compensation programs.

DR. RAY R. IRANI Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
 Conference Call  Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
Los Angeles, California
January 25, 2007
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
As Steve Chazen will tell you in some detail shortly, our fourth quarter results helped drive our core income for the year to a record high level of $4.3 billion. Our financial performance continues to reflect the successful implementation of our long-term strategy that is focused on long-lived oil and gas assets, a disciplined investment philosophy and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We took a number of steps last year to further strengthen the foundation of our core operations. Our acquisition of oil and gas producing assets from Vintage Petroleum and Plains Exploration and Production Company has strengthened operations in our core areas of Texas, California and Latin America. These acquisitions helped increase our average 2006 annual production to an all-time high of more than 600,000 equivalent barrels per day.
We also increased the annual dividend rate by 24 percent, which was the fifth rate increase since 2002. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet.
In addition, we implemented and expanded a share repurchase program that resulted in our repurchase of more than 30 million shares of
1
our common stock out of the 40 million shares that the board of directors has authorized for repurchase. The share repurchase program is continuing this year.
We ended the year with $1.6 billion in cash on hand, and even at current oil prices we expect to continue generating a significant amount of free cash flow in 2007 to support our growth initiatives. With the strides we made last year, we believe 2007 has the potential to be another strong year for both our oil and gas and chemical businesses.
As we look ahead in 2007, we plan to aggressively pursue the exploitation of the properties we acquired from Vintage and Plains in California and Argentina. We also expect to continue with our consolidation initiatives in the Permian Basin and California.
In addition, we expect the Dolphin project to be fully operational around mid-year, with plans to ramp up production to 2 billion cubic feet per day by year-end.
We expect to drill between 14 and 16 exploration wells in Libya this year, with 10 to 12 wells onshore and the remaining 4 wells offshore. This focused effort is the most extensive exploration initiative in Oxy's history, and we are excited by the quality of the prospects.
As we have discussed before, we continue to work on a number of new, high potential projects in the Middle East and North Africa. We expect to announce success in winning at least two of these projects this year.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

 Conference Call  Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Announcement
Los Angeles, California
January 25, 2007
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the quarter was $928 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, compared to $1.152 billion, or $1.40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005. Core income for the quarter was $835 million, or $0.98 per diluted share. The fourth quarter 2006 core income excludes a $57 million after-tax gain from the sale of 10 million shares of our investment in Lyondell, an $89 million after-tax gain for litigation settlements, a $20 million after-tax charge for the purchase of debt on the open market and a $40 million non-cash tax charge resulting from the changes in compensation programs.
Fourth quarter actual results were different than the third quarter conference call guidance because of lower Chemicals earnings, higher income tax rates and environmental remediation charges. Chemical segment earnings were about $40 million lower due to much weaker demand than expected. There was a 2 percentage point increase in the worldwide effective income tax rate due to a change in the mix with more income coming from higher taxed foreign sources than from U.S. income. Charges for environmental reserves increased by $15 million, to $23 million in the fourth quarter.

Higher rate reflects a change in the mix - with more income coming from higher taxed foreign sources than from US income.

Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings - 1Q07 Outlook
We closed the sale of our 50% interest in the Vanyoganneft JV (Russia) to TNK-BP on January 18.  
We received $485 mm cash.
We expect to record a gain of approx. $400 mm in 1Q07.  
We will remove the production volumes from cont. ops for comparability.
Oil and Gas production from cont. ops of 590 to 600 mboe/day in 1Q07.
Recent sale reduces 4Q06 production by 26 mboe/day and from year-end exit rate of 616 mboe/day (see attached schedule).
Expect 1Q07 production rate to continue until the Dolphin Project comes on stream.
Exploration expense of about $100 mm driven by drilling and seismic activities in Libya.
12
 
Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings - 1Q07 Outlook
Expect Total Capex for 2007 of about $3.3 to $3.4 Billion.
Oil & Gas accounting for approximately 90 percent.
Year-to-year increase in capex is due to the Oman Mukhaizna project, development of the Vintage acquisition properties in Argentina and California, the exploratory activity in Libya, and a Permian gas plant and CO expansion.  
2
Increases partly offset by lower expenditures for the Dolphin project which will start-up later this year.
Expect 1Q07 Chemical Earnings to be similar to 4Q06 results.  
Volume in January expected to remain weak with continuing improvement in February and March.
We currently expect improvement from these levels in subsequent quarters.  
Expect Interest Expense to be about $15 million.
Excludes charges for the recently announced debt reduction tender.

Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings - 1Q07 Outlook
Commodity Price Sensitivity
A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings by about $38 million (pre-tax).  The WTI price in 4Q06 was $60.20 per barrel, compared to the current price of approx. $53 per barrel.  This $7 a barrel WTI price drop is expected to reduce Oil & Gas segment income by $265 million.
A change of 25-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $12 million impact on quarterly earnings (pre-tax).  The NYMEX gas price for 4Q06 was $6.27 per mcf. Our realized 4Q06 domestic gas price averaged $5.64 per mcf.
We expect DD&A to be $2.4 billion for full-year 2007.
We expect our effective worldwide tax rate in 1Q07 to be about 49%.  
Higher taxes are due to an increase in the proportion of income outside the US.
