Section 8  Other Events
  
Item 8.01.
Other Events
On April 24, 2007, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the first quarter 2007 was $1.212 billion ($1.43 per diluted share), compared with $1.231 billion ($1.43 per diluted share) for the first quarter 2006. Core results for the first quarter 2007 were $831 million ($0.98 per diluted share), compared with $1.153 billion ($1.34 per diluted share) for the same period in 2006. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.070 billion for the first quarter 2007, compared with $1.910 billion for the same period in 2006. Oil and gas earnings were $1.549 billion for the first quarter 2007, after excluding gains from the sale of Oxy's investment in the Russian Vanyoganneft joint venture and litigation settlements, compared with $1.910 billion for the first quarter 2006. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of segment earnings to core results. The decline in the first quarter 2007 reflected $233 million of decreases from lower crude oil and natural gas prices, increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil production.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the first quarter 2007 was $58.24 per barrel compared to $63.48 per barrel in the first quarter 2006. Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $51.78 per barrel for the first quarter 2007, compared with $55.38 per barrel for the first quarter 2006. The average price for NYMEX gas in the first quarter 2007 was $7.17 per MCF, compared with $11.42 per MCF in the first quarter 2006. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $8.36 per MCF in the first quarter 2006 to $6.38 per MCF for the first quarter 2007.
Production
For the first quarter 2007, daily oil and gas production from continuing operations averaged 587,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), a 24,000 BOE increase over the 563,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the first quarter 2006. The improvement was a result of the Vintage and Plains acquisitions and higher Middle East production in the first quarter, partially offset by an incident at Elk Hills involving the natural gas gathering lines. The Elk Hills incident negatively impacted Oxy's net production for the quarter by 14,000 barrels per day.
Chemicals
Chemical first quarter 2007 segment earnings were $137 million, compared with first quarter 2006 segment earnings of $250 million. The first quarter 2007 results reflect lower margins for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride.
Items Affecting Net Income
The first quarter 2007 core results of $831 million excludes, net of tax: a $109 million gain for litigation settlements, a $412 million gain resulting from the sale of Oxy's 50-percent investment in the Russian Vanyoganneft joint venture, a $110 million charge for the completion of a cash tender offer for various debt issues, and a $30 million provision for a plant closure and related environmental remediation reserve.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks, such as drilling of unsuccessful wells; global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; changes in tax rates and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this release. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 Conference Call 
First Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
April 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
Consistent with our strategy of focusing on our core areas, we just announced two separate transactions with BP. First, Oxy will acquire for cash BP's West Texas pipeline system in the Permian Basin. Second, BP will acquire for cash Oxy's interests in Pakistan.
When this transaction closes in the third quarter, it will further strengthen Oxy's industry-leading position in the Permian. It will add to our current Permian pipeline assets and will give us a total of 3,844 miles of pipelines in the region with a capacity to transport approximately 190,000 barrels per day from the Permian basin to the market hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.
The exiting of Pakistan, which follows our departure from Russia in January, will further focus our efforts into our major core areas.
1
As you may have read in the press, we have recently submitted proposals for the development of two major sour gas fields to ADNOC officials in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi has the fifth largest gas reserves in the world. This project has been reported to require an estimated total future capital investment of $10 billion with production estimated at well over a billion cubic feet per day for 25 to 30 years.
In addition, we are in the advanced stages of negotiations on other large oil and gas development projects in our core Middle East/North Africa region.
Before I turn the call over to Steve Chazen, I would like to update you on the Dolphin Project in which we have a 24.5 percent interest. The 230-mile-long natural gas pipeline has been fully tested. Currently, about 300 million cubic feet per day of gas supplied by a third-party is moving through the pipeline system to markets in Dubai. We expect Dolphin gas to begin flowing to the market in July with full-scale production building to an initial two billion cubic feet per day around year-end. I would like to remind everyone that this project was structured to generate a steady stream of cash and earnings for the next 25 years.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve.

First Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
April 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the quarter was $1.212 billion, or $1.43 per diluted share, compared to $1.231 billion, or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 core results were $831 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $1.153 billion, or $1.34 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. The 2007 first quarter core results exclude, net of tax: a $412 million gain from the sale of our interest in Russia, a $109 million gain from litigation settlements, a $110 million charge for the completion of a cash tender offer for various debt issues and a $30 million provision for a plant closure.
On a segment basis, oil and gas first quarter 2007 core results, which exclude the gains from the Russian sale and the litigation settlements, were $1.549 billion, compared to $1.910 billion for the first quarter of 2006. The following factors accounted for the change in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
3
4
Oil and gas operating costs were $11.71 a barrel compared to last year's $11.23 a barrel, and increased about 2% from the fourth quarter.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter 2007 of $137 million was lower than our fourth quarter conference call guidance. January was a strong month; however, industry demand weakened through February and March leading to lower margins. Chemicals earned $250 million in last year's first quarter. The primary factor that accounted for the quarter-to-quarter difference was lower margins for chlor-alkali and PVC.
Net interest expense, excluding debt retirement charges, was $9 million during the first quarter 2007, compared to $29 million in the 2006 first quarter.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. We received total proceeds of $485 million from the sale of our interest in the Russian joint venture. We used $785 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $815 million to repurchase debt and $185 million to pay dividends. In addition, we spent $320 million to repurchase 7.0 million common shares at an average price of $45.89 per share. These net cash outlays reduced our $1.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $100 million to $1.5 billion at March 31. Debt was $2.24 billion at the end of the quarter, with non-current debt of $1.7 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first quarter were 841.0 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 846.5 million. At March 31, there were 838.1 million basic shares outstanding and the fully dilutive share amount was approximately 843.6 million.
5
 
Oxy's annualized return on equity was 25 percent, with an annualized return on capital employed of 24 percent, despite having increased shareholder equity to $20.2 billion, compared to $18 billion a year ago.
As we look ahead in the current quarter:

First Quarter 2007 Earnings - 2Q07 Outlook
We expect Oil and Gas production in the range of 585 to 600 mboe/day in 2Q07.
2Q07 is expected to include some reduction from PSCs and one less lifting compared to the 1Q07 production.
Previously announced BP transactions will not affect production until their expected closing in 3Q07.
Expect 2Q07 production rate to continue until the Dolphin Project comes on stream.
Commodity Price Sensitivity
A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings by about $40 million (pre-tax).
A change of 50-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings (pre-tax).  The NYMEX gas price for 1Q07 was $7.17 per mcf.
Exploration expense of about $110 million for seismic and drilling for our Libya and South American programs.
10
First Quarter 2007 Earnings - 2Q07 Outlook
Expect 2Q07 Chemical Earnings to be in the range of $150 to $160 million compared to $137 million in 1Q07.
Chlorine demand, particularly into vinyls, was weaker in 1Q07, however this has led to a tightening market for its co-product, caustic soda.
We expect caustic soda prices and margins to increase in 2Q07.
Expect Interest Expense to be about $10 million in 2Q07.
We will redeem all of the outstanding $276 million of the 8.25% Vintage Petroleum, LLC senior notes on May 1, 2007.
Expect our combined worldwide tax rate in 2Q07 to remain about 49 percent.
