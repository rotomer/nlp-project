Modification to 2006 Majority Vote Director Resignation Policy
In 2006, in response to a stockholder proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new Policy, embodied in an amendment to the Company's By-laws, to provide that, in an uncontested election, any Director who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must tender his or her resignation. In such event, under this 2006 Policy, the Corporate Governance Committee would then consider the resignation and possible responses to it based on the relevant facts and circumstances, and make a recommendation to the Board.
The Committee and the Board have now determined to modify the foregoing 2006 Policy to provide that it will apply to all Directors who have previously been elected by the stockholders, but that, in an uncontested election, any Director standing for election by the stockholders for the first time would not be elected unless he or she is elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast at his or her first Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
