Dr. Ray R. Irani
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
All of us here today share a strong interest in Oxy's performance. In fact, performance is at the heart of every decision we make at Oxy.
This morning, I'm going to review the highlights of our 2006 performance and tell you about some of our current initiatives to enhance future stockholder value.

The Pursuit of Excellence
But first, I want to pay tribute to our management team, and our employees worldwide. Together, they provide the focus and energy that drive the company forward.
3
The Pursuit of Excellence
Their commitment to operational and financial excellence, together with their commitment to high standards of social responsibility, have not only won Oxy a lot of fans on Wall Street, but also on Main Street.
4
The Pursuit of Excellence
I want to express my personal gratitude, to our entire Board of Directors, and to all our employees for a job well done.

Consistent Performance
"Same old Oxy story!
Consistent, great performance."
Wall Street Analyst
2006 was another year of record achievements. Anyone can have a good year or two, but what really attracts Wall Street's attention is consistently strong performance over the long term.
Following a recent meeting, an analyst from an investment firm made the following remark, "Same old Oxy story. , ." He went on to say that while he monitors a company's quarterly and annual results, "what really tells the story is the trend in performance over a multi-year period."

Those of you who were Oxy stockholders and employees in 1990 will remember that we had a much different mix of businesses than we have today. In 1990, oil and gas accounted for only 17 percent of our asset mix, compared to 72 percent in 2006.
These changes were the direct result of our restructuring program to replace a collection of under-performing businesses with long-lived oil and gas assets and build an excellent chemical business.
Today, Oxy is a highly focused company with two core businesses where the emphasis is on consistent performance.
Let's look at some examples that illustrate that point.

This chart compares Oxy's cumulative total return to stockholders with the cumulative total return of the Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index, the Integrated Oil & Gas Index and the overall S&P 500 Index.
If you invested $100 in Oxy stock at year-end 2001, the value of your investment would have grown to $415 by the end of 2006.
A $100 investment in the Exploration & Production Index would have resulted in a return of $295.
By comparison, your $100 investment in the Integrated Oil Index would have yielded $225 over the same period.
And, if you had invested $100 in the overall S&P 500 Index, your investment would have been worth only $135 after the same five years.

While all of us can take pride in our past achievements, our focus must be on the future.
We believe that we will continue creating superior value for our stockholders by sticking with our business strategy of balancing profitability with growth, and remaining focused on the key metrics that drive our business.
Our consistent improvement over the years clearly shows that we have had the right strategy in place and a strong team to make it work.
We believe continued focus on balancing profits with growth will enable us to keep delivering the kind of , results that you expect of us.

The key to our oil and gas strategy is concentrating on geographic areas where we have competitive advantages. Right now, that means the United States, the Middle East/North Africa region and Latin America.
Our assets are large and long-lived, and we expect to see combined production from these core areas grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 5 to 8 percent through 2010.

Last year, U.S. production averaged 367,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 61 percent of our total worldwide production. The yellow areas show the location of Oxy properties in California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
As we continue to grow our international business, one of our goals is to maintain a strong U.S. base that will account for a minimum of 50 percent of our worldwide reserves and production. A dominant U.S. base gives Oxy a lower risk profile than other international oil and gas companies.

In 2006, California contributed 21 percent of our worldwide production. As we look ahead in 2007 and beyond, we plan to aggressively pursue the exploitation of the California properties we acquired last year.

We have repeatedly stressed our intentions to continue with our consolidation initiatives in the Permian Basin, in Texas, and New Mexico. As you can see from the oil and gas producing properties highlighted in the box, we have a strong position in the Permian Basin.
Our size and infrastructure in Texas and New Mexico give us significant economies of scale, and make us a natural regional consolidator.

BP will receive Oxy's Horn Mountain interest in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, currently operated by BP. Of course, these transactions are subject to government approvals.
When these transactions close in the third quarter, they will further strengthen Oxy's industry-leading position in Texas by adding net production of approximately 8,000 equivalent barrels per day and proved reserves of 39 million equivalent barrels.

Let's now turn to our operations in the Middle East and North Africa.
In 2006, Oxy's net production from this region totaled 119,000 equivalent barrels per day and accounted for 20 percent of our worldwide total.
Production from this region is going to increase significantly this year with the start up of the giant Dolphin natural gas project.

The Dolphin Project is one of the largest projects of its kind in the world.
The gas will be produced from the world's largest natural gas field offshore Qatar. It will be transported to the processing plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar, which is one of the largest facilities of its kind.
The 230-mile long pipeline has been fully tested. Currently, about 300 million cubic feet per day of gas supplied by a third-party is moving through the pipeline to markets in Dubai. We expect Dolphin gas to begin flowing to the market in July, with full-scale production building to an initial two billion cubic feet per day around year-end. To give you a perspective of this volume, it is about equal to a third of the average daily natural gas used in all of California.
And, I would like to remind everyone that this project should generate a steady stream of cash and earnings for the next 25 years.
35
New Middle East Proposals
Libya

UAE
In addition, as you may have read in the press, we have recently submitted proposals for the development of two major gas fields in the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi has the fifth largest gas reserves in the world. This project has been reported to require an estimated total future capital investment of $10 billion with production estimated at well over a billion cubic feet per day for 25 to 30 years.
We are also in the advanced stages of negotiations on other large oil and gas development projects in our core Middle East/North Africa region.

In Oman, we have laid a strong foundation for future growth that has been built around our operations in Blocks 9 and 27 in the northern part of the country. Oxy's 2006 net production from Oman averaged 23,000 equivalent barrels per day.
In September 2005, the Government of Oman awarded Oxy a contract to operate the giant Mukhaizna heavy oil field.
Along with our partners, we plan to invest approximately $3.8 billion to increase Mukhaizna's gross production, which is currently averaging about 11,000 barrels per day to 150,000 barrels per day within the next few years.
Work on the Mukhaizna field remains on track. This year, Oxy expects to invest between $400 and $450 million in this important project.
In 2006, we were awarded Block 54. This exploration Block has characteristics similar to the adjacent Mukhaizna field.

We are excited about the opportunities in Libya where we control approximately 30 million acres. If you consolidated all of these blocks, you would fill a portion of Texas larger than the Permian Basin.
Last year, production from our historic fields averaged 23,000 barrels of oil per day. But our real excitement surrounds Libya's exploration potentials. We plan to drill between 14 and 16 exploration wells this year with 10 to 12 wells onshore and the remaining 4 wells offshore. This effort is the most extensive exploration initiative in Oxy's history, and we are impressed with the quality of the prospects.
We also have begun commercial negotiations with Libyan officials for a large enhanced oil recovery project following a favorable review of our comprehensive technical proposal.

Let's now turn to Latin America where our primary focus is on operations in Argentina and Colombia. As you all know, Latin America has been experiencing a great deal of political turmoil and social unrest during the last several years. However, Colombia and Argentina have two of the most stable governments in the region.
Last year, our operations in Argentina and Colombia accounted for combined average production of 72,000 equivalent barrels per day net to Oxy, or about 12 percent of our worldwide total.

We have identified at least 700 new drilling locations targeting proved, undeveloped reserves. We plan to drill 190 new wells this year, and carry out an aggressive drilling program for at least the next five years.
During that period, we expect to increase production to approximately 70,000 barrels per day.

Let's turn briefly to our chemical business, which compares favorably with our chemical industry peers.
Like our oil and gas operations, our chemical business is focused on optimizing profitability and cash flow from large core assets where we have economies of scale. We aggressively manage our costs and maintain a disciplined capital spending program.
As a result, OxyChem's 2006 operating profit as a percent of sales is the highest among our chemical industry peers. OxyChem's profit margin of 18.7 percent was nearly double the average profit margin of 10.2 percent for our competitors.
