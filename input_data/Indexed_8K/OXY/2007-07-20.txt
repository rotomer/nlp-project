Item 5.02
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On July 18, 2007, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of Occidental Petroleum Corporation authorized grants of incentive awards under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to the executive officers named in the Company's 2007 Proxy Statement and other employees. The named officers received performance-based, at-risk, awards, that are intended to link the greatest portion of their potential compensation to the Company's performance over specified future performance periods. Each named officer received a Return on Equity Incentive award and a Total Shareholder Return Incentive award and one officer also received a Long-Term Incentive award. The forms of award agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3.
The Return on Equity Incentive is a cash award that vests and becomes payable at the end of the three-year performance period from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2010, depending on the sum of the Company's return on equity for each of the twelve quarters in the performance period. Payout will be at 200 percent of the target incentive amount specified in dollars on the award agreement for cumulative return on equity of 54 percent or more over the three-year period. No payout will be made unless cumulative return on equity is more than 33 percent.
The Total Shareholder Return Incentive is denominated in target performance shares, each of which is equal to one share of the Company's common stock. The number of shares received at the end of the four-year performance period, which runs from July 18, 2007 through July 17, 2011, will depend on a peer company comparison of total stockholder return. The peer companies are: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, BP p.l.c., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc. Depending on the Company's total stockholder return compared to the total stockholder returns of its peers, the grantee will receive an amount ranging from 0 percent to 150 percent of the target performance shares, which amount will be payable one-half in shares of the Company's common stock and one-half in cash. During the performance period, dividend equivalents are paid with respect to the target performance shares in an amount equal to the dividend declared per share of common stock.
The Long-Term Incentive award is denominated in long-term incentive units, each of which is equal to one share of the Company's common stock. One-third of each award becomes payable in cash after a continuous service period running from July 18, 2007 through July 17, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. During the service period, dividend equivalents are paid with respect to the long-term incentive units in an amount equal to the dividend declared per share of common stock.
Payout for the Return on Equity Incentive, the Total Shareholder Return Incentive and the Long-Term Incentive awards depends on the grantee remaining employed throughout the applicable performance or service period; however, if the grantee becomes disabled, retires or is terminated for the convenience of the Company during the performance or service period, then the grantee will forfeit the right to receive a pro rata portion of the payout based on the days remaining in the performance or service period after such event. If the grantee dies during the performance or service period, the grantee will forfeit the right to receive a pro rata portion of the payout based on the days remaining in the performance period with respect to Return on Equity Incentive and the Total Shareholder Return Incentive awards but all unvested Long-Term Incentive awards will vest and become immediately payable. If the grantee is terminated for cause or terminates voluntarily, the award agreement will automatically terminate on the termination date and the grantee will forfeit the right to receive any payout under the award. In the event of a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Incentive Plan), the Return on Equity Incentive award and the Total Shareholder Return Incentive awards will vest on the date of Change of Control at the target
1
incentive amount and target performance share level, respectively. The Long-Term Incentive awards vest immediately and become nonforfeitable unless, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control Event, the plan administrator, determines otherwise.
Return on Equity and Total Shareholder Return Incentive awards were made to the six highest-paid executives, Dr. Irani and Messrs. Chazen, Morgan, Olson, de Brier and Hallock, in the following target incentive and target performance share amounts: $29,250,000 and 254,320 shares; $13,000,000 and 113,031 shares; $2,600,000 and 22,607 shares; $2,600,000 and 22,607 shares; $2,470,000 and 21,476 shares; and $800,000 and 9,689 shares; respectively. Mr. Hallock also received 9,689 long-term incentive units.
On July 19, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an extension of the February 2005 employment agreement with Dr. Ray R. Irani, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, from May 2010 to May 2015. All other terms and conditions of the agreement remain the same as in the 2005 agreement. Those other terms and conditions are described in the company's report on Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. The form of employment agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.4.

3.          The Performance Goal for the Performance Period is based on the attainment of at least a minimum Return on Equity, as set forth on Exhibit 1. Return on Equity for the purposes of Exhibit 1 shall be calculated (i) by determining the Return on Equity for each quarter in the three-year period ending June 30, 2010 by dividing the Company's Net Income (as defined in the Plan) for each such quarterly period by the stockholder equity as of the end of such quarter, in each case as reported in the financial statements of the Company and (ii) adding together the calculated result for each of the 12 quarters.

4.          (a) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the last day of the Performance Period to receive payment of this award. The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantee's employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence. However, if, prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a "Forfeiture Event"), then the Target Incentive Amount upon which the Grantee's award is based will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining in the Performance Period following the date of the Forfeiture Event. If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before the end of the Performance Period, then the Target Incentive Amount is reduced to zero.

If a peer company ceases to be a publicly-traded company at any time during the Performance Period or the Administrator determines pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement to reflect a change in circumstances with respect to any peer company, then such company will be removed as a peer company and the achievement of the Performance Goal will be determined with respect to the remaining peer companies as set forth on Exhibit 1.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD AGREEMENT
(Equity-based, Cash-Settled Award)
is made as of the Date of Grant between OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Occidental") and, with its subsidiaries, (the "Company"), and Grantee.
THIS AGREEMENT
1.          In accordance with this Agreement and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), Occidental grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the number of Long-Term Incentive Units ("LTI Units") set forth above, subject to adjustment under the Plan and Section 6 of this Agreement. A LTI Unit represents the right to receive in cash, upon vesting, as set forth in Section 3, the Long-Term Incentive Value of one share of Occidental Common Stock, $0.20 par value (the "Common Stock"). LTI Units are not Common Shares and have no voting rights or, except as stated in Section 5, dividend rights. "Long-Term Incentive Value" means the last reported sale price of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on the applicable Vesting Date or Change of Control Event.

3.          (a) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the applicable Vesting Date to receive payment of this award in the number of LTI Units shown for such Vesting Date. The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantee's employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence. However, if, prior to any Vesting Date, the Grantee becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a "Forfeiture Event"), then the number of unvested LTI Units will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining until the final Vesting Date following the date of the Forfeiture Event. If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before any Vesting Date, then this Agreement will terminate automatically on the date

of Grantee's termination and Grantee shall forfeit the right to receive any unvested LTI Units. If the Grantee dies while in the employ of the Company before any Vesting Date, all of the unvested LTI Units will vest as of the date of death and become immediately payable.
(b)       If a Change in Control Event occurs prior to the last Vesting Schedule Date, all unvested LTI Units shall immediately vest and become nonforfeitable unless, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control Event, the Administrator, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, determines that such Event will not accelerate vesting of any of these LTI Units. Any such determination by the Administrator is binding on the Grantee.
4.          Payment of the Long-Term Incentive Value for each LTI Unit, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 3 and 6 of this Agreement, will be settled in cash only. Payment will be made to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the applicable Vesting Schedule Date, date of death or the Change in Control Event, as the case may be.
