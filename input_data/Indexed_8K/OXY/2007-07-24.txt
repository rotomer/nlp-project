Item 8.01.
Other Events
On July 24, 2007, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income for the second quarter 2007 was $1.412 billion ($1.68 per diluted share), compared with $860 million ($0.99 per diluted share) for the second quarter 2006. The second quarter 2007 net income includes $419 million after-tax gains ($0.50 per diluted share) from the sale of non-core assets. The second quarter 2006 net income includes a $347 million after-tax loss ($0.40 per diluted share) from the write-off of assets and income from the operations of assets written off and held for sale.
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings, excluding the results of Pakistan, which was sold, and Horn Mountain, which was exchanged, at the end of June, were $1.682 billion for the second quarter 2007, compared with $1.857 billion for the same period in 2006. The decline in the second quarter 2007 earnings reflected decreases from lower crude oil prices, increased DD&A rates and higher exploration and operating expenses, partially offset by higher production and natural gas prices.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the second quarter 2007 was $65.05 per barrel compared to $70.70 per barrel in the second quarter 2006. Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $59.11 per barrel for the second quarter 2007, compared with $61.66 per barrel for the second quarter 2006. The average price for NYMEX gas in the second quarter 2007 was $7.56 per MCF, compared with $7.26 per MCF in the second quarter 2006. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $6.23 per MCF in the second quarter 2006 to $7.07 per MCF for the second quarter 2007.
Production
For the second quarter 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 583,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 609,000 BOE per day produced in the second quarter 2006. Daily production, excluding Horn Mountain, Pakistan and Russia, was 558,000 BOE for the second quarter 2007, compared with 551,000 BOE for the second quarter 2006.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $158 million, compared with second quarter 2006 segment earnings of $251 million. The second quarter 2007 results reflect lower margins for chloro-vinyl products.
Items Affecting Net Income
The second quarter 2007 net income includes after-tax gains of $419 million, consisting of: a $181 million gain resulting from the sale of 18.6 million shares of the investment in Lyondell common stock, a $116 million gain from the sale of Pakistan assets to BP, a $107 million gain from the swap of Horn Mountain assets with BP and a $15 million gain from the sale of domestic mineral interests.
The second quarter 2006 net income includes a net after-tax loss of $347 million, consisting of: a $415 million loss from the write-off of assets, $45 million income for the operations of assets written off and $23 million income from the Vintage properties held for sale.
In addition to the second quarter items affecting net income, net income for the six months of 2007 includes, net of tax: a $112 million gain for litigation settlements, a $412 million gain resulting from the sale of Oxy's 50-percent investment in the Russian Vanyoganneft joint venture, a $107 million charge for the completion of cash tender offers for various debt issues, and a $30 million provision for a plant closure and related environmental remediation reserve. The six months of 2006 includes an additional $78 million income from operations of assets held for sale.
SIX-MONTHS RESULTS
Net income for the six months of 2007 was $2.624 billion ($3.11 per diluted share), compared with $2.091 billion ($2.42 per diluted share) for the six months of 2006.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings, excluding Pakistan and Horn Mountain results, were $3.690 billion for the six months of 2007, compared with $3.668 billion for the same period and on the same basis in 2006. Oil and gas earnings were $3.143 billion for the six months of 2007, after also excluding gains from the sale of Oxy's investment in the Russian Vanyoganneft joint venture, sale of mineral interests and litigation settlements. The decline in the six months of 2007 reflected $284 million of decreases from lower crude oil and natural gas prices, increased DD&A rates and higher exploration and operating expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas production.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the six months of 2007 was $61.61 per barrel compared to $67.09 per barrel in the six months of 2006. Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $55.34 per barrel for the six months of 2007, compared with $58.53 per barrel for the six months of 2006.

Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $7.25 per MCF in the six months of 2006 to $6.74 per MCF for the same period of 2007.
Production
For the six months of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 587,000 BOE, compared with 601,000 BOE per day produced in the six months of 2006. Daily production, excluding Horn Mountain, Pakistan and Russia, was 559,000 BOE for the six months of 2007, compared with 542,000 BOE for the six months of 2006.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the six months of 2007 were $295 million, compared with six months of 2006 segment earnings of $501 million. The 2007 results reflect lower margins for chloro-vinyl products.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: Tuesday, July 24, 2007
Occidental Petroleum Announces Second Quarter Earnings
LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income for the second quarter 2007 was $1.412 billion ($1.68 per diluted share), compared with $860 million ($0.99 per diluted share) for the second quarter 2006. The second quarter 2007 net income includes $419 million after-tax gains ($0.50 per diluted share) from the sale of non-core assets. The second quarter 2006 net income includes a $347 million after-tax loss ($0.40 per diluted share) from the write-off of assets and income from the operations of assets written off and held for sale.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Net income for the first six months of 2007 was at a record high $2.624 billion. We look ahead to the remainder of the year as the giant Dolphin Project, one of the largest energy projects ever undertaken in the Middle East, has become operational. Dolphin is now delivering natural gas from its wells in Qatar's North Field to customers in the United Arab Emirates. This unique project will have significant impact on the region and we expect our 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin to provide a steady contribution to Oxy's financial performance for the next 25 years."
"During the first half of 2007, Occidental has strengthened its asset base by acquiring additional producing properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and by divesting of non-core assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Pakistan, and Russia. The net impact of these transactions, together with the Dolphin Project production ramp-up, should result in Occidental producing at a year-end exit rate in the range of 630,000 to 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day," said Dr. Irani.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
July 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Good morning  and thank you for joining us.
As you are no doubt aware, we announced two weeks ago that the giant Dolphin Project was fully operational and is delivering natural gas from Dolphin wells in Qatar's North Field to customers in the United Arab Emirates. As one of the largest energy initiatives ever undertaken in the Middle East, this unique project will have a significant impact on the development of the region and we expect it to be a steady contributor to Oxy's financial performance over the next 25 years.
When this project was in its formative stages, some industry observers expressed doubt that it could be completed on time and on budget because of huge cost overruns and lengthy construction delays typically incurred by other mega-energy projects. In the case of Dolphin, we're exceptionally pleased that it is on target to deliver the projected production of 2 billion cubic feet per day with minimal variance in the project's budget and construction schedule. This is a remarkable achievement for a project of this size and scope.
Let me take a minute or two to give you an overview of the project to date.
1
More than 20 wells were drilled to a depth of between 10,000 and 12,000 feet in the North Field's Khuff Zone, which is one of the world's largest natural gas reservoirs. These wells produce not only natural gas, but also associated natural gas liquids. The liquids are separated from the gas stream at Dolphin's newly completed, 500-acre gas processing plant in Ras Laffan. The dry gas is then transported through a 48-inch, 230-mile long subsea pipeline completed late last year to the Taweellah receiving facility in the United Arab Emirates. The gas then supplies plants in the UAE and in the near future, Oman.
Regional authorities are forecasting substantial additional growth in demand for natural gas, and Dolphin's gas grid is uniquely positioned to serve this expanding market.
We expect Dolphin gas production to ramp-up throughout the balance of this year and reach approximately two billion cubic feet per day by early next year. Ethane production from the project will be sold to Qatar under a long-term contract while the other liquids will be sold in international markets.
As a result of Oxy's 24.5-percent interest in Dolphin, we expect our net share of production to ramp up to an average of 60,000 to 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and remain in that range for the foreseeable future.
Total cost of the Dolphin Project is expected to be approximately $4.8 billion including investments in the existing UAE eastern gas distribution system and related pipelines. Oxy's investment in the Dolphin Project is approximately $1.2 billion of which investments of $361 million were made last year and approximately $218 million are expected this year. We expect the ROCE on Dolphin to be excellent, continuing at very attractive levels for the next 25 years.
2
Let me shift briefly to our ongoing efforts to add major new growth projects in the Middle East region.
I alluded to some of those opportunities last quarter, and while it remains premature to discuss the individual status of those negotiations, I'm pleased to report that we have not encountered any unforeseen obstacles to hinder our efforts. Our discussions are proceeding as expected and I remain confident that formal announcements will be made prior to year-end.
Since our continuing involvement in the projects to develop natural gas reserves in Abu Dhabi has received considerable attention in the industry press, I will comment specifically on that opportunity.
Oxy is honored to have been selected as one of the finalists for these giant gas projects. As you know, they involve development of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and related liquids at the Shah and Bab fields, as well as multibillion dollar capital investments. We look forward to the final decision on participation in these projects later in the year.
Finally, I would like to update you on our production outlook for this year. As you will hear shortly from Steve Chazen, our worldwide oil and gas production for the first six months averaged 587,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Following our various asset trades and acquisitions in 2007, together with the ramp-up of the Dolphin Project, we expect the net effect to result in a 2007 year-end exit rate in the range of 630,000 to 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
With our focus on the continued strengthening of our core areas in an environment of robust energy prices, we expect 2007 to be another excellent year for Oxy.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
July 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the quarter was $1.412 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared to $860 million, or $0.99 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. The 2007 second quarter net income includes $419 million of after-tax gains ($0.50 per diluted share) from the sale of non-core assets, comprised of the following: a $181 million gain from the sale of 18.6 million shares (89 %) of our investment in Lyondell, the remaining 2.4 million shares were sold in early July; a $116 million gain from the sale of the Pakistan assets; a gain of $107 million from the swap of the Horn Mountain assets with BP; and a $15 million gain from the sale of domestic mineral interests. At the end of the second quarter, we sold Pakistan and exchanged the Gulf of Mexico (Horn Mountain) assets with BP for producing properties in the Permian Basin and oil pipelines. The results of these operations will be reported as discontinued operations in our second quarter 10Q filing with the SEC. The second quarter 2007 also includes $44 million after-tax income ($0.06 per diluted share) from the Pakistan and Horn Mountain operations and other.
4
Here's the segment breakdown for the .
second quarter
Oil and gas second quarter 2007 results, excluding the Horn Mountain and Pakistan operations were $1.682 billion. After excluding the gain from the sale of domestic mineral interests, the second quarter 2007 results were $1.656 billion, compared to $1.857 billion for the second quarter of 2006. The following accounted for the decline in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
5
Oil and gas production costs for the first half of 2007 were $12.30 a barrel compared to last year's $11.70 a barrel. The increases were a result of higher field operating and maintenance expenses.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter 2007 of $158 million was in line with our first quarter conference call guidance. Chemicals earned $251 million in last year's second quarter. The primary factor that accounted for the quarter-to-quarter difference was lower chloro-vinyl margins due to lower industry demand.
Net interest expense, excluding debt retirement charges, was a net $1 million income during the second quarter 2007, compared to $33 million expense in the 2006 second quarter.
6
The worldwide effective tax rate, excluding the impact of asset sales and other significant items, was 46 percent for the second quarter of 2007, three percent lower than our guidance. The lower rate reflects a change in the mix  with more income coming from U.S. sources than higher taxed foreign sources.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance through the .
first six months
Net income was $2.624 billion, or $3.11 per diluted share for the first six months of 2007, compared with $2.091 billion, or $2.42 per diluted share for the same period of 2006. In addition to the asset sales recorded in the second quarter, the six months 2007 also includes income of $387 million, net of tax for the following: a $412 million gain from the sale of our Russian investment, a $112 million gain for litigation settlements, a $107 million charge for cash tender offers for various debt issues and a $30 million provision for a plant closure.
Worldwide oil and gas production for the six months averaged 587,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 601,000 BOE production in the first six months of last year. Production after excluding Russia, Pakistan and Horn Mountain, averaged 559,000 BOE for the first six months of 2007, an increase of 3 percent over the 542,000 BOE for the same period of 2006.
Capital spending was $850 million for the quarter and $1.630 billion for the first six months. We expect total capital spending for the year to be in the range of $3.4 to $3.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations for the six months was approximately $2.9 billion. We received total proceeds of $485 million from the sale of our interest in the Russian joint venture, $55 million from the sale of domestic
7
mineral interests and $600 million from the sale of 19 million shares of our investment in Lyondell. We used $1.6 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $500 million for acquisitions, $1.1 billion to repurchase debt and $370 million to pay dividends. In addition, we spent $550 million to repurchase 11.2 million common shares at an average price of $49.84 per share. These net cash outlays reduced our $1.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $100 million to $1.5 billion at June 30. Debt was $2.0 billion at the end of June, with non-current debt of $1.7 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months were 839.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 843.2 million. At June 30, there were 835.1 million basic shares outstanding and the fully dilutive share amount was approximately 839.0 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 9 percent, down from 13 percent at yearend 2006. Over the first half of the year, Oxy's annualized return on equity was 26 percent, with an annualized return on capital employed of 24 percent.
As we look ahead in the :
current quarter
8
We expect the oil and gas production year end exit rate to be in the range of 630,000 to 650,000 BOE per day. The increase includes 47,000 to 65,000 BOE per day from Dolphin, 7,000 BOE per day from the Permian assets acquired in the BP swap and 6,000 BOE per day from the announced acquisition of Qatar assets from Anadarko.

Second Quarter 2007 Earnings - 3Q07 Outlook
We expect 3Q07 Oil and Gas production of 585 to 590    mboe/day.
Increase vs. 2Q07 includes:
17 mboe/day from Dolphin.
7 mboe/day from the Permian assets acquired in the BP swap.
4 mboe/day from the announced acquisition of Qatar assets from Anadarko.  
Sale of Pakistan and swap of Horn Mountain will reduce 3Q07 production by 25 mboe/day compared to 2Q07.
Dolphin expected pre-tax income contribution of $10 million in 3Q07 (including start-up gas sales and pipeline tariff volumes).
3Q07 will include Dolphin start-up expenses and full operating costs (including interest on the pipeline operations which was capitalized during construction).

Second Quarter 2007 Earnings - 3Q07 Outlook
Commodity Price Sensitivity
A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings by about $40 million (pre-tax).
A change of 50-cents per million BTUs in gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings (pre-tax).  The NYMEX gas price for 2Q07 was $7.56 per mcf.
Exploration expense of about $95 million for seismic and drilling for our Libya and South American programs.
16
 
Second Quarter 2007 Earnings - 3Q07 Outlook
We expect 3Q07 Chemical earnings to be in the range of $160 to $175 million compared to $158 million in 2Q07.
Interest expense of about $12 million in 3Q07.
The increase vs. 2Q07 reflects the loss of capitalized interest on the Dolphin Project.
Expect our worldwide tax rate in 3Q07 to increase to about 47 percent, due to increases in foreign exploration.
