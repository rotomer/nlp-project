Item 8.01.
Other Events
On October 24, 2007, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.324 billion ($1.58 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2007, compared with $1.170 billion ($1.36 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2006. Core results for the third quarter of 2007 were a record high of $1.210 billion ($1.45 per diluted share), after excluding after-tax gains of $72 million from the sale of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, $34 million from the sale of non-core assets and $8 million from discontinued operations; compared with $1.103 billion ($1.28 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2006. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.029 billion for the third quarter of 2007, compared with $1.790 billion for the same period in 2006. The third quarter of 2007 core results were $1.988 billion, after excluding pre-tax gains of $12 million from the sale of domestic interests and $103 million from the sale of exploration properties, partially offset by a $74 million pre-tax loss from the impairment of assets, primarily exploration properties. The $198 million increase in the third quarter 2007 core results to $1.988 billion from $1.790 billion in 2006 reflected increases from higher crude oil prices and production volumes, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the third quarter of 2007 was $75.38 per barrel compared to $70.53 per barrel in the third quarter of 2006. Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $67.81 per barrel for the third quarter of 2007, compared with $61.83 per barrel for the third quarter of 2006. The average price for NYMEX gas in the third quarter of 2007 was $6.69 per MCF, compared with $6.33 per MCF in the third quarter of 2006. Domestic realized gas prices increased slightly from $5.88 per MCF in the third quarter of 2006 to $5.90 per MCF for the third quarter of 2007.
Production
For the third quarter of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 570,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 533,000 BOE per day produced in the third quarter of 2006. The increased production included 15,000 BOE per day from Dolphin, 12,000 BOE per day from domestic operations and the remainder primarily from the Middle East.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $212 million, compared with $248 million for the same period in 2006. The third quarter of 2007 results reflect lower margins for polyvinyl chloride.
NINE-MONTHS RESULTS
Net income for the nine months of 2007 was $3.948 billion ($4.69 per diluted share), compared with $3.261 billion ($3.78 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2006.
Core results were $2.941 billion ($3.50 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2007, compared with $3.332 billion ($3.86 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2006. Net income for the nine months of 2007 includes, after-tax: a $72 million gain from the sale of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, a $22 million gain from the sale of domestic oil and gas interests, a $112 million gain for litigation settlements, a $208 million gain from the sale of 21 million shares of Lyondell Chemical Corporation, a $412 million gain resulting from the sale of Oxy's 50-percent investment in Russia, a $107 million charge for the completion of cash tender offers for various debt issues, a $30 million provision for a plant closure and related environmental remediation reserve and $318 million income from discontinued operations. Net income for the nine months of 2006 includes a $71 million after-tax loss from discontinued operations. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $5.719 billion for the nine months of 2007, compared with $5.458 billion for the same period of 2006. Oil and gas core results were $5.131 billion for the nine months of 2007 after excluding gains from the sale of Oxy's investment in Russia, sales of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, sales of domestic oil and gas interests, and litigation settlements. The decline of $327 million in the nine months of 2007 core results from $5.458 billion in 2006 reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, increased DD&A rates and higher exploration and operating expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil and natural gas production.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the nine months of 2007 was $66.20 per barrel compared to $68.24 per barrel in the nine months of 2006. Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $59.47 per barrel for the nine months of 2007, compared with $59.61 per barrel for the nine months of 2006. The average price for NYMEX gas in the nine months of 2007 was $7.14 per MCF, compared with $8.34 per MCF in the nine months of 2006. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $6.79 per MCF in the nine months of 2006 to $6.45 per MCF for the same period of 2007.
Production
For the nine months of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 563,000 BOE, compared with 539,000 BOE per day produced in the nine months of 2006.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the nine months of 2007 were $507 million, compared with $749 million for the same period in 2006. The 2007 results reflect lower margins for polyvinyl chloride.

LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income of $1.324 billion ($1.58 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2007, compared with $1.170 billion ($1.36 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2006. Core results for the third quarter of 2007 were a record high of $1.210 billion ($1.45 per diluted share), after excluding after-tax gains of $72 million from the sale of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, $34 million from the sale of non-core assets and $8 million from discontinued operations; compared with $1.103 billion ($1.28 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2006. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Increase in our production volume, including initial production from the Dolphin Project and increases in worldwide crude oil prices, contributed to Oxy's record setting third quarter core income results of $1.210 billion. This reflects the continued successful implementation of our long-term strategy that is focused on current and new long-lived oil and gas assets in our core regions that produce strong financial returns."

 Conference Call 
Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
October 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Good morning and thank you for joining us.
This has been a good quarter for Oxy. Increase in our production volume, including initial production from the Dolphin Project and increases in worldwide crude oil prices contributed to Oxy's record third quarter core income results of $1.210 billion. This reflects the continued successful implementation of our long-term strategy that is focused on current and new long-lived oil and gas assets in our core regions that produce strong financial returns.
The Dolphin Project continues to go very well. The first two trains of the gas plant are in operation and performing at levels 5 to 10 percent above their nameplate capacity. The remaining two trains are expected to come on between now and year-end and we expect to reach full capacity in early 2008.
1
On the past several calls I have expressed confidence that additional growth at Oxy will be driven by new opportunities in the Middle East/North Africa region and that we expect to announce two new agreements before year-end. I know you are all anxious to hear details. However, while it remains premature to give you any specifics today, I want to emphasize that I continue to be optimistic about our ability to deliver on our promises.
As you are aware, we are a finalist in the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company selection of a partner to develop the giant Shah gas field and we look forward to the decision in coming weeks. We are also making progress in developing additional projects in the United Arab Emirates.
In Libya, we are in commercial negotiation for large enhanced oil recovery projects for existing fields.
Earlier this month we closed on the acquisition of blocks 12 and 13 in Qatar that we acquired from Anadarko and expect to immediately add 5,000 BOE per day to our net production. In addition, we were recently awarded two offshore exploration areas in Bahrain. These areas are technically quite interesting and adjacent to major producing fields in Qatar. We are also submitting a proposal to work with Bahrain to increase oil production from existing onshore areas.
2
We are confident in our prospects for continued strong financial performance and growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

 Conference Call 
Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
October 24, 2007
Los Angeles, California
Thank you, Ray.
Net income for the quarter was $1.324 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share, compared to $1.170 billion, or $1.36 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. The current quarter diluted earnings per share increase of 16.2 percent compared to last year was greater than the 13.2 percent net income increase as a result of the share repurchase program. Core results were $1.210 billion, or $1.45 per diluted share in the third of quarter 2007, compared to $1.103 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. The 2007 third quarter net income includes $106 million of after-tax gains from the sale of non-core assets, comprised of the following: a $72 million gain from the sale of the West Africa exploration properties, net of oil and gas asset impairments; a $27 million gain from the sale of the remaining 2.4 million Lyondell shares; and a $7 million gain from the sale of domestic oil and gas interests. The third quarter of 2007 includes $8 million income from discontinued operations, compared to $67 million income in the third quarter of 2006.
Here's the segment breakdown for the
third quarter.
Oil and gas third quarter 2007 segment earnings were $2.029 billion. After excluding the gains that I just described, the third quarter 2007 results
4
were $1.988 billion, compared to $1.790 billion for the third quarter of 2006. The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
5
Oil and gas production costs for the first nine months of 2007 were $12.56 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $11.70 a barrel. The increases were a result of higher field operating and maintenance costs mainly in the US and Latin America.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $212 million, which was higher than our second quarter guidance of $160 to $175 million. The improvement in earnings from our guidance was due to higher prices across the chloro-vinyls product chain. Despite weakness in domestic demand, chlorine derivative exports were particularly strong in the third quarter. Chemicals earned $248 million in last year's third quarter. The primary factor that accounted for the quarter-to-quarter difference was lower polyvinyl chloride margins.
The worldwide effective tax rate, excluding the impact of asset sales and other significant items, was 42 percent for the third quarter of 2007, five percent lower than our guidance. The lower quarterly rate reflects a positive effect on the income tax rate resulting from substantial increases in crude oil prices in the second half of 2007 and lower foreign exploration expense, due to delay of certain drilling activities. In addition, the quarter was favorably impacted by a change in the mix with a larger portion of income coming from U.S. sources rather than higher taxed foreign sources.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance through the .
first nine months
6
Net income was $3.948 billion, or $4.69 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2007, compared with $3.261 billion, or $3.78 per diluted share for the same period of 2006. Core results were $2.941 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2007, compared with $3.332 billion, or $3.86 per diluted share for the same period of 2006.
Worldwide oil and gas production for the nine months averaged 563,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 4 percent, compared with 539,000 BOE production in the first nine months of last year.
Capital spending was $880 million for the quarter and $2.510 billion for the first nine months. We expect total capital spending for the year to be about $3.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations for the nine months was approximately $4.3 billion. Additionally, we received total proceeds of $670 million from the sale of our investment in Lyondell, $485 million from the sale of our interest in the Russian joint venture, $230 million from the sale of our Pakistan properties, $120 million from the sale of exploration properties and $75 million from the sale of domestic oil and gas interests. We used $2.5 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.0 billion for acquisitions, $1.0 billion to repurchase debt and $560 million to pay dividends. We spent $910 million to repurchase 17.4 million common shares at an average price of $52.27 per share. These net cash outlays reduced our $1.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $100 million to $1.5 billion at September 30. Debt was $2.0 billion at the end of September, with long-term debt of $1.7 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months were 837.0 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding
7
were 840.9 million. At September 30, there were 829.7 million basic shares outstanding and the dilutive share amount was approximately 833.7 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 8 percent, down from 13 percent at yearend 2006. Over the first nine months of the year, Oxy's annualized return on equity was 26 percent, with an annualized return on capital employed of 24 percent.
As we look ahead in the :
current quarter
We expect the oil and gas production year end exit rate to be in the range of 615,000 to 635,000 BOE per day. The increase includes 45,000 to 50,000 BOE per day from Dolphin, 5,000 BOE per day from the announced acquisition of Qatar assets from Anadarko and higher Latin American production. The Dolphin exit rate could be higher, as noted in our previous guidance, depending on how quickly the final train of the gas plant ramps up to full capacity. In any case we expect it to be running at full capacity during January.

Third Quarter 2007 Earnings - 4Q07 Outlook
We expect Oil and Gas production of 600 to 615 mboe/day in 4Q07.
Increase includes:
21 mboe/day from Dolphin;
5 mboe/day from the acquisition of Qatar assets from Anadarko.
We expect Dolphin's 4Q07 after-tax income in the range of $50 to $60 million.
Dolphin expected to operate at 55% of capacity in 4Q07; contributions will improve as it becomes fully operational.

Third Quarter 2007 Earnings  2007 Year-End Production Exit Rate Outlook
We expect the oil and gas production year-end exit rate to be 615 to 635 mboe/day.
Increase (vs. 3Q07) includes:
45 to 50 mboe/day from Dolphin;
Dolphin exit rate could be higher depending on ramp-up pace of final train of the gas plant to full capacity;
Expect Dolphin to run at full capacity during January 2008.
5 mboe/day from the announced acquisition of Qatar assets from Anadarko;
Higher Latin American and other production.

Third Quarter 2007 Earnings - 4Q07 Outlook
Commodity Price Sensitivity
A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings by about $35 mm before income taxes and Dolphin;
A change of $0.50 per mmBTU in domestic gas prices has a $24 mm pre-tax impact on quarterly earnings.  The NYMEX gas price for 3Q07 was $6.69 per mcf.
We expect exploration expense of about $80 to $100 mm for seismic and drilling for our Libya and Latin American exploration programs.
15
 
Third Quarter 2007 Earnings - 4Q07 Outlook
We expect 4Q07 Chemical segment earnings to be in the range of $100 to $140 million.
Decline (vs. 3Q07) reflects:
Normal seasonal downturn;
Continued weakening demand due to lower housing starts;
Lower chloro-vinyl margins due to higher energy and ethylene costs.
We expect 4Q07 chemical product prices and volumes as follows:
Chlorine prices -10% vs. 4Q06, with comparable volumes;
Caustic soda prices +20% vs. 4Q06, with comparable volumes;
PVC prices up slightly vs. 4Q06, with volumes to be about similar;
Ethylene costs at least +30% vs. 4Q06.
16
 
Third Quarter 2007 Earnings - 4Q07 Outlook
Difficulty of predicting interim period tax rates is due to:
Interim period rates are based on projected total year income and taxes;
Oxy's tax rate is sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices and foreign expensed exploration;
Changes in oil prices have an inverse effect on income tax rates;
Rising oil prices increases the proportion of US income which has lower income tax rates than our international operations;
Oxy generally records no tax benefit on foreign expensed exploration until the project is completely abandoned.
We expect 4Q07 foreign exploration expense, which is not currently tax deductible, to be ~ $70 mm.
The 4Q07 worldwide tax rate before this exploration expense is expected to be ~ 45%.
We expect our combined worldwide 4Q07 tax rate, including exploration expense, to be ~ 46%.
