Earnings Information
 
                                               
On January 29, 2008, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced record net income of $5.400 billion ($6.44 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.191 billion ($4.87 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.
 
                                               
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.452 billion ($1.74 per diluted share), compared with $930 million ($1.09 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
                                               
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.599 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.422 billion for the same period in 2006.  The $1.2 billion increase in the fourth quarter 2007 segment earnings reflected $1.3 billion of increases from record crude oil and higher natural gas prices and volumes from the Dolphin project in the UAE coming on line in 2007, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses.
 
                                               
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $90.68 per barrel, compared to $60.20 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $80.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $52.55 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2006.  The average price for NYMEX gas in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $7.06 per MCF, compared with $6.27 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Domestic realized gas prices increased from $5.63 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $6.77 per MCF for the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the fourth quarter of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 590,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 561,000 BOE per day produced in the fourth quarter of 2006.
                                               
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $94 million, compared with $157 million for the same period in 2006.  The fourth quarter of 2007 results reflect lower margins for polyvinyl chloride.
 
                                               
Net income for the twelve months of 2007 was a record $5.400 billion ($6.44 per diluted share), compared with $4.191 billion ($4.87 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.
 
                                               
Core results were also a record $4.405 billion ($5.25 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.116 billion ($4.78 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.  See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
 
                                               
Oil and gas segment earnings were $8.318 billion for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $6.880 billion for the same period of 2006.  Oil and gas core results were $7.730 billion for the twelve months of 2007 after excluding gains from the sale of Oxy's joint venture in Russia, sales of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, sales of domestic oil and gas interests, and litigation settlements.  The increase of $850 million in the twelve months of 2007 core results from $6.880 billion in 2006 reflected $1.3 billion from higher crude oil and natural gas prices, and increased production, including Dolphin coming on line in the third quarter of 2007, partially offset by higher DD&A rates, exploration and operating expenses.
 
                                               
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the twelve months of 2007 was $72.32 per barrel compared to $66.23 per barrel in the twelve months of 2006.  Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $64.77 per barrel for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $57.81 per barrel for the twelve months of 2006.  The average price for NYMEX gas in the twelve months of 2007 was $7.12 per MCF, compared with $7.82 per MCF in the twelve months of 2006.  Domestic realized gas prices increased slightly from $6.49 per MCF in the twelve months of 2006 to $6.53 per MCF for the same period of 2007.
 
                                               
For the twelve months of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 570,000 BOE, compared with 545,000 BOE per day produced from continuing operations in the twelve months of 2006.
 
                                               
Chemical segment earnings for the twelve months of 2007 were $601 million, compared with $906 million for the same period in 2006.  The 2007 results reflect lower margins for polyvinyl chloride.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount.  Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items.  This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods.  Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term.  Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The following tables set forth the core results and significant items affecting earnings for each operating segment and corporate:

For Immediate Release: January 29, 2008
 
LOS ANGELES  Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced record net income of $5.400 billion ($6.44 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.191 billion ($4.87 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.452 billion ($1.74 per diluted share), compared with $930 million ($1.09 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Oxy achieved the highest full year net income in our history and another record quarter core results.  Driven largely by record oil and gas earnings, this achievement reflects the continued success of our strategy to focus on profitable, long-lived oil and gas assets, a disciplined investment philosophy and maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We are pleased with the 25.7% return on equity for the full year of 2007.
 
"In 2007, Occidental's consolidated subsidiaries preliminary proved reserve additions from all sources totaled 242 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to production of 209 million BOE, for a production replacement rate of 116 percent.
 
"While high commodity prices clearly have boosted earnings throughout the industry, Oxy has consistently produced top-quartile results in capturing the value from higher prices on an equivalent barrel basis and delivering it to the bottom line."
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.599 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $1.422 billion for the same period in 2006.  The $1.2 billion increase in the fourth quarter 2007 segment earnings reflected $1.3 billion of increases from record crude oil and higher natural gas prices and volumes from the
Dolphin project in the UAE coming on line in 2007, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses.
 
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $90.68 per barrel, compared to $60.20 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2006.

For the fourth quarter of 2007, daily oil and gas production averaged 590,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 561,000 BOE per day produced in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $94 million, compared with $157 million for the same period in 2006.  The fourth quarter of 2007 results reflect lower margins for polyvinyl chloride.
 
Net income for the twelve months of 2007 was a record $5.400 billion ($6.44 per diluted share), compared with $4.191 billion ($4.87 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.
 
Core results were also a record $4.405 billion ($5.25 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.116 billion ($4.78 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2006.  See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.

Oil and gas core results were $7.730 billion for the twelve months of 2007 after excluding gains from the sale of Oxy's joint venture in Russia, sales of exploration properties, net of asset impairments, sales of domestic oil and gas interests, and
 
litigation settlements.  The increase of $850 million in the twelve months of 2007 core results from $6.880 billion in 2006 reflected $1.3 billion from higher crude oil and natural gas prices, and increased production, including Dolphin coming on line in the third quarter of 2007, partially offset by higher DD&A rates, exploration and operating expenses.
 
The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil in the twelve months of 2007 was $72.32 per barrel compared to $66.23 per barrel in the twelve months of 2006.

Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Announcement
 
January 29, 2008
Los Angeles, California
 
Net income for the quarter was $1.452 billion, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared to $930 million, or $1.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The 2007 fourth quarter net income includes $16 million after-tax severance charges and $4 million after-tax income from discontinued operations.  Core results were a record $1.464 billion, or $1.76 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $784 million, or $0.92 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Here's the segment breakdown for the .
fourth quarter
 
Oil and gas fourth quarter 2007 segment earnings were $2.599 billion, compared to $1.422 billion for the fourth quarter of 2006.  The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
 
                 
Higher worldwide oil and gas price realizations resulted in an increase of
$1.3 billion of earnings over the comparable period in 2006.  Occidental's average realized crude oil price in the 2007 fourth quarter was $27.75 higher than in the comparable period in 2006.  Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $6.77, compared with $5.63 for the fourth quarter 2006.
 
                 
Worldwide oil and gas production from continuing operations for the quarter averaged 590,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an
 
 
increase of 5.2 percent, compared with 561,000 BOE production in the fourth quarter of last year.  The bulk of the production improvement was the result of the Dolphin project start-up which contributed 36,000 BOE per day.
 
                 
Our guidance for the fourth quarter production was in the range of 600,000 to 615,000 BOE per day.  We were under this range due to the impact of product prices that reduced volumes from our production sharing contracts by 8,000 BOE per day, a well blowout in Libya of 4,000 BOE per day and 5,000 BOE per day lower in Argentina due to strikes in October and November.
 
                 
Dolphin contributed $62 million to after-tax income during the fourth quarter which was slightly ahead of our guidance of $50 to $60 million.  The sales volumes were 36,000 BOE per day in line with our guidance.  The Dolphin 2007 production exit rate was 43,000 BOE per day.
 
                 
Exploration expense was
$101 million in the quarter.
 
Oil and gas production costs for the twelve months of 2007 were $12.87 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $11.70 a barrel.  The increases were a result of higher field operating and maintenance costs.
 
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $94 million, which was lower than our third quarter guidance of $100 to $140 million.  The decline in earnings from our guidance was due to lower polyvinyl chloride margins due to higher feedstock costs and weaker industry demand. 
Chemicals earned $157 million in last year's fourth quarter.  The primary factor that accounted for the quarter-to-quarter difference was lower polyvinyl chloride margins.
 
 
The worldwide effective tax rate, excluding the impact of asset sales and other significant items, was 42 percent for the fourth quarter of 2007, four percent lower than our guidance of 46 percent due primarily to significantly higher oil & gas prices.  The increased oil price resulted in a higher portion of U.S. income which has lower income tax rates than our international operations.
 
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance through the .
twelve months
 
Net income was a record $5.400 billion, or $6.44 per diluted share for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.191 billion, or $4.87 per diluted share for the same period of 2006.  Core results were also a record at $4.405 billion, or $5.25 per diluted share for the twelve months of 2007, compared with $4.116 billion, or $4.78 per diluted share for the same period of 2006.
 
Worldwide oil and gas production for the twelve months averaged 570,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 4.6 percent, compared with 545,000 BOE production in the twelve months of last year.
 
Capital spending was $987 million for the quarter and $3.497 billion for the twelve months.  We currently expect total capital spending for 2008 to be between $3.8 and $3.9 billion.  We expect increased 2008 capital spending for the Colombia LCI project, Argentina and Vintage California.
 
Cash flow from operations for the twelve months was approximately $6.8 billion.  We received $1.6 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets.  We used $3.5 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.4 billion for acquisitions, $1.2 billion to repurchase debt and preferred stock and $765 million to pay dividends.  We spent $1.130 billion to repurchase 20.6 million common shares at an average price of
 
$54.75 per share.  These net cash inflows increased our $1.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $400 million to $2.0 billion at December 31.  Debt was $1.8 billion at the end of December, a reduction of $1.1 billion from the debt balance of $2.9 billion at the end of 2006.
 
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months were 834.9 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 839.1 million.  At December 31, there were 827.2 million basic shares outstanding and the diluted share amount was approximately 831.3 million.
 
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 7 percent, down from 13 percent at yearend 2006.  Oxy's 2007 return on equity was 26 percent, with return on capital employed of 24 percent.
 
As we look ahead in the :
current quarter
 
                 
We expect oil and gas production to be in the range of 600,000 to 615,000 BOE per day during the first quarter, at last quarter's $90 oil price.
 
                 
Dolphin is expected to become fully operational in February and run at 78 percent of capacity, with production of 53,000 BOE per day during the first quarter.  Dolphin after-tax earnings are expected to be between $90 and $100 million in the first quarter, based on a $90 oil price.
 
We expect the production rate for the 2008 full year to increase to approximately 620,000 to 630,000 BOE per day, at about $80 oil, from 2007.  The increase is due to the full year operations of Dolphin, increased production from Mukhaizna in Oman, increased production in Argentina and Colombia and the impact of acquisitions, slightly offset by the new contract in Libya.
 
Occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit.  Occidental's share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline.  Overall, Occidental's net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices.  A $5.00 change in oil price affects Occidental's production by approximately  4,000 barrels per day.
 
With regards to -
prices
 
                 
A $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $38 million.
 
                 
A swing of 50-cents per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.
 
Additionally 
 
                 
We expect exploration expense to be about $70 to $90 million  for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.
 
                 
We expect chemical segment earnings to be in the range of $100 to $125 million, compared to $94 million in the fourth quarter.  Improved volumes and prices in vinyls and higher caustic soda prices are the primary drivers of the improvement.  This is less than the first quarter 2007 earnings of $137 million, due to weakness in construction which impacts industry demand.
 
                 
We expect DD&A expense to be $2.4 billion for Oil & Gas and $0.3 billion for the rest of the Company in 2008.
 
                 
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the first quarter, to be about 43 percent.  Our fourth quarter and twelve months U. S.
 
and foreign tax rates are included in the "Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule".
 
                 
The company has embarked on a cost reduction program which will affect operating and G&A costs.  In 2007, we took restructuring charges totaling $25 million, and we expect a similar amount in 2008.  We've also made improvements in our procurement functions.  Combined savings realized from this program are expected to be $200 million in 2008 with an annualized run-rate over the longer term of $300 million.  The primary focus of this program is on the more mature areas of the company, as opposed to our areas of growth.  Our target is to bring G&A in line with our historical costs per BOE.

Exhibit 99.4
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.5
 
For Immediate Release: January 29, 2008
 
LOS ANGELES  Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced today that in 2007 the company's consolidated subsidiaries had preliminary proved reserve additions from all sources of 242 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) compared to production of 209 million BOE, for a production replacement rate of 116 percent.  Occidental incurred $4.45 billion in costs for oil and gas property acquisitions and exploration and development activities.  At the end of 2007, Occidental's consolidated reserves-to-production ratio, assuming production remained at the 2007 level, was 13.7 years.
 
At year-end 2007, Occidental's worldwide proved reserves, on a consolidated basis, totaled 2.87 billion BOE compared to 2.83 billion BOE at the end of 2006.
 
The 2007 consolidated proved reserve additions totaled 242 million BOE.  Improved recovery provided 104 percent of total additions, acquisitions 25 percent, extensions and discoveries 10 percent, which were partially offset by reductions in previous estimates of the total proved reserve additions.
 
Over 90 percent of the net additions were in the United States, with the most substantial increases in the Permian Basin, Elk Hills field and the Rocky Mountains.  In the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were attributable to higher prices and enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling and water flood wells, additional CO2 flood development programs and bolt-on acquisitions.  The Elk Hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques which contributed to their increased reserves.
 
In 2007, Occidental increased proved developed reserves to 80 percent of total proved reserves from 78 percent at year-end 2006. 
The Dolphin project transferred 101 million BOE to the proved developed category during 2007, with no remaining undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2007 for this project.  In the United States, the Elk Hills field and the Permian Basin transferred 21 million BOE each into proved developed reserves from undeveloped.
 
For the three-year period 2005-2007, Occidental's consolidated proved reserve additions totaled 1.125 billion BOE, and total production equaled 580 million BOE, for a reserve replacement rate of 194 percent.  Over the past three years, Occidental incurred $17.63 billion in costs for property acquisitions and exploration and development activities.  Disclosures in this press release are for continuing operations as of December 31, 2007; accordingly, Pakistan and Horn Mountain reserves and costs have been excluded.
 
Occidental sold its 33 million BOE share of a Russian joint venture in January 2007.  After this sale, only the minority shareholder's interest in a Colombian affiliate and an equity investment in Yemen remain classified in other interests.
 
Occidental Petroleum Corporation is an international oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Middle East/North Africa and Latin America regions.  Oxy is the fourth largest U.S. oil and gas company, based on equity market capitalization.  Oxy's wholly owned subsidiary, OxyChem, manufactures and markets chlor-alkali products and vinyls.  Occidental is committed to safeguarding the environment, protecting the safety and health of employees and neighboring communities and upholding high standards of social responsibility in all of the company's worldwide operations.
 
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties
that could significantly affect expected results.  Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks, such as drilling of unsuccessful wells; global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; operational interruptions; changes in tax rates and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition.

OIL AND GAS PRELIMINARY RESERVES
The following table sets forth Occidental's net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate and natural gas, and changes in such quantities.  Crude oil reserves (in millions of barrels) include condensate.  Natural gas volumes (in billion cubic feet) have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) based on energy content of 6,000 cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil.
 
 
(a) Approximately three percent of the proved developed oil reserves and approximately 14 percent of the proved developed gas reserves at December 31, 2007 are non-producing. Occidental's plans are to begin producing these reserves in 2008.
PRELIMINARY
COSTS INCURRED
