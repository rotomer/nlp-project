Cost Reduction Program
Oxy has embarked on a Cost Reduction Program
The impact of the Program:
It will affect operating and G&A costs;
Restructuring charge taken in 2007 totaling $25 mm;
Expect a similar amount to be taken in 2008;
Improvements made in our procurement function;
Combined savings realized from this program are expected to be $200 mm in 2008 with a longer-term annualized run-rate of $300 mm.
The primary focus of this program is on the more mature areas of the company, as opposed to our areas of growth.

Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results.  Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher than expected costs; operational interruptions; political risks; changes in tax rates; unrealized acquisition benefits or higher than expected integration costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition or disposition.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this presentation.  Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward- looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Additionally, the SEC requires oil and natural gas companies, in their filings, to disclose non-financial statistical information about their consolidated entities separately from such information about their equity holdings and not to show combined totals.  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use certain terms in this presentation, such as recoverable reserves, that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from using in filings with the SEC.  Certain information in this presentation is shown on a combined basis; however, the information is disclosed separately on our web site at
