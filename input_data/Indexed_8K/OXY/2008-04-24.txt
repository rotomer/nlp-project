Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On April 24, 2008, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.846 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $1.212 billion ($1.43 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2007.
 
Core results for the first quarter of 2008 were $1.819 billion ($2.20 per diluted share), compared with $788 million ($0.93 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2007.
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.888 billion for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $1.883 billion for the same period in 2007. Oil and gas core results for the first quarter of 2007 were $1.362 billion, after excluding a $412 million gain from the sale of Occidental's Russian joint venture and $109 million gain from the resolution of certain legal disputes. The $1.5 billion increase in the first quarter 2008 core results reflected $1.6 billion of increases from record crude oil and higher natural gas prices, production from the Dolphin project coming on line in the second half of 2007, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses.
 
For the first quarter of 2008, daily oil and gas production averaged 607,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 560,000 BOE per day produced in the first quarter of 2007. The bulk of the production increase was the result of 55,000 BOE per day from the Dolphin project, which began production in the third quarter of 2007, partially offset by lower volumes from our production sharing contracts due to higher prices.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $86.75 per barrel for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $51.67 per barrel for the first quarter of 2007. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $6.38 per MCF in the first quarter of 2007 to $8.15 per MCF for the first quarter of 2008.
 
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $179 million, compared with $137 million for the same period in 2007. The first quarter of 2008 results reflect higher margins for caustic soda.

Midstream, Marketing and Other
 
Occidental's midstream, marketing and other segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, and markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and CO2. The transportation and storage systems primarily serve operations from New Mexico across the Permian Basin to Cushing, Oklahoma. Occidental's 24.5-percent equity interest in the Dolphin pipeline project is also included in this segment. Additionally, this segment also generates electricity at facilities in Texas, Louisiana and California.
 
Midstream segment preliminary earnings were approximately $123 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared with approximately $119 million for the first quarter of 2007. Prior period oil and gas segment earnings have been revised to remove these midstream results.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For Immediate Release: April 24, 2008
Occidental Petroleum Announces Record First Quarter Net Income
LOS ANGELES, Apr. 24, 2008 -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income of $1.846 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $1.212 billion ($1.43 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2007.
Core results for the first quarter of 2008 were $1.819 billion ($2.20 per diluted share), compared with $788 million ($0.93 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2007.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our net income for the first quarter of 2008 set a new company record, driven by an 8.4-percent increase in production over last year's first quarter, as well as improved oil and gas prices. These results continue our momentum from 2007, the most successful year in Oxy's history, and provide a strong start to propel us into the remainder of 2008."
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.888 billion for the first quarter of 2008, compared with $1.883 billion for the same period in 2007.

 Conference Call 
First Quarter 2008 Earnings Announcement
 
April 24, 2008
Los Angeles, California
 
 
Thank you Chris.
Net income for the quarter was a record $1.846 billion, or $2.23 per diluted share, compared to $1.212 billion, or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. Core results in the first quarter of 2008 were $1.819 billion, or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to $788 million, or $0.93 per diluted share for the same period of 2007.
Here's the segment breakdown for the
first quarter.
Oil and gas first quarter 2008 segment earnings were $2.888 billion, compared to $1.883 billion for the first quarter of 2007. Oil and gas core results for the first quarter of 2007 were $1.362 billion, after excluding a $412 million gain from the sale of our Russian joint venture and a $109 million gain from the resolution of certain legal disputes. The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
 
The first quarter 2008 production costs per barrel are approximately 39 cents less than the fourth quarter of 2007. Oil and gas production costs for the first three months of 2008 were $12.94 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $12.36 a barrel. These numbers were adjusted to remove the midstream costs. The increases reflected higher production and ad valorem taxes and higher field operating costs.
 
 
2
 
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $179 million, which was higher than our guidance of $100 to $125 million. Chemicals earned $137 million in last year's first quarter. The improvement in earnings was due to higher prices and margins in caustic soda along with higher PVC and VCM volumes exported to non-U.S. dollar denominated economies.
We have reclassified our midstream assets out of the oil and gas segment. Our midstream assets are comprised of the following businesses:
 
 
3
 
The net book value of midstream properties was approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2007. As we disclosed earlier, we earned $123 million during the first quarter of 2008 from these assets. Midstream capital spending and property acquisition costs were approximately $430 million in 2007 and are expected to be about the same in 2008. These funds will be spent enhancing our CO2 production and expanding our pipeline capacity.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 42 percent for the first quarter of 2008, as compared to our guidance of 43 percent.
Capital spending was $868 million for the quarter. We currently expect total capital spending for 2008 to be about $4 billion. The increase from the prior estimate is a result of capital for the Rockies, California and Midstream assets.
Cash flow from operations for the three months was approximately $2.7 billion. We used $870 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.6 billion for acquisitions and $210 million to pay dividends. We spent $435 million to repurchase 6.3 million common shares at an average price of $69.68 per share. These and other net cash outflows decreased our $2.0 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $500 million to $1.5 billion at March 31. The first quarter U.S. income tax payments reflect true-ups of 2007 amounts due. The second quarter
 
 
4
 
payments will increase since two quarterly estimated tax payments will be due. Debt was $1.8 billion at the end of March, which was unchanged from December 31, 2007.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the three months were 823.6 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 828.2 million. At March 31, there were 821.5 million basic shares outstanding and the diluted share amount was approximately 826.1 million.
Oxy's 2008 annualized return on equity was 32 percent, with annualized return on capital employed of 29 percent.
As we look ahead in the
current quarter:

First Quarter 2008 Earnings  Midstream, Marketing and Other
Midstream assets reclassified out of the Oil and Gas segment
The assets are comprised of the following businesses:
 - 
 Oxy's marketing group markets our equity production and manages third party transactions.  The primary drivers of these earnings are marketing and trading margins in oil and gas, transportation and storage programs.
Marketing
 - 
 Oxy's domestic wet gas production and third party production is processed through 13 Permian and 2 other gas plants to extract NGLs and deliver dry gas to the pipelines.  The primary driver for margins and cash flows is the difference between inlet costs of natural gas and market prices for NGLs and inlet volumes processed.
Gas processing plants
 - 
 In the Permian basin, Oxy owns an oil-gathering, common carrier pipeline company with approximately 2,750 miles of pipeline, and a storage system with 5 mm barrels of active storage.  The main margin and cash flow drivers are volumes shipped.  Oxy also owns a 24.5% equity interest in the Dolphin Pipeline, which carries gas to markets in the UAE.
Pipelines
 - 
 Oxy owns 2 cogen plants, one in TX and one in LA, and an equity investment in a gas-fired power plant at Elk Hills.  The three plants have combined electricity capacity to produce 1,768 megawatts per hour.
Power generation
 - 
 CO is processed and transported from the Permian Basin for use in Oxy's EOR program, and the earnings represent the small volume sold to 3 parties.

First Quarter 2008 Earnings - 2Q08 Outlook
We expect 2Q08 oil and gas production in the range of 610 to 620 mboe/day, at $100 oil prices.
Production increases expected in Argentina, Colombia, Rocky Mountains, Permian and Oman;
Partially offset by decreases due to high cost recovery levels in 1Q08.
We currently expect total capital spending for 2008 to be about $4 billion.
The increase from the prior estimate is a result of capital for the Rockies, California and Midstream Assets.

First Quarter 2008 Earnings - 2Q08 Outlook

Includes the impact of Dolphin;
Includes production sharing contract price impact of approximately 500 barrels per day.
A change of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $25 mm impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.
We expect 2Q08 exploration expense to be about $80 to $100 mm for our seismic and drilling programs.

First Quarter 2008 Earnings - 2Q08 Outlook
We expect 2Q08 Chemical earnings to be in the range of $120 to $140 mm, compared to $179 mm in 1Q08.
Higher feedstock costs are the primary driver of the reduced forecast.
Outlook is also below 2Q07 earnings of $158 mm due to weakness in domestic construction which impacts industry demand.
Cash tax payments in 2Q08 will increase since two quarterly estimated tax payments will be due.  US income tax payments in 1Q08 reflect true-ups of 2007 amounts due.
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in 2Q08 to remain at about 42%.
