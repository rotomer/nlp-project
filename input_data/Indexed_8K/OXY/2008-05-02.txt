Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will," "expect," or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results.  Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:  exploration risks, such as drilling of unsuccessful wells; global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; operational interruption; changes in tax rates; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition, or disposition.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this presentation.
