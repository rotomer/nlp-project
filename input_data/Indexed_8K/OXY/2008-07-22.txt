GRANT
OF RETURN ON EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARD.
  In accordance with this Agreement and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"
Plan
"
), Occidental grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the right to receive in Cash up to 200% of the Target Incentive Amount.

.
                                    
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
.
  Neither this Agreement nor any right to receive cash pursuant to this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by the Grantee other than (i) to a beneficiary designated on a form approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law), by will or, if the Grantee dies without designating a beneficiary of a valid will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, if applicable, (if approved or ratified by the Committee).

.
                                    
PERFORMANCE GOAL
.
  The Performance Goal for the Performance Period is based on the attainment of at least a minimum Return on Equity (as defined in Appendix A to the Plan), as set forth on Exhibit 1.  Return on Equity for the purposes of Exhibit 1 shall be calculated (i) by determining the Return on Equity for each quarter in the three-year period ending June 30, 2011 by dividing the Company's Net Income (as defined in the Plan) for each such quarterly period by the stockholder equity as of the end of such quarter, in each case as reported in the financial statements of the Company and (ii) adding together the calculated result for each of the 12 quarters.

VESTING AND FORFEITURE OF RETURN ON EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARD
. 
(a) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the last day of the Performance Period to receive payment of this award.  The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantee's employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence.  However, if, prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates employment as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a "Forfeiture Event"), then the Target Incentive Amount upon which the Grantee's award is based will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining in the Performance Period following the date of the Forfeiture Event.  If the Grantee terminates
employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before the end of the Performance Period, then the Target Incentive Amount is reduced to zero.
 
(b)
                                
The Grantee's right to receive payment in cash of this award in an amount not to exceed 200% of the Target Incentive Amount will be based on, and become nonforfeitable upon the Committee's certification of, the attainment of the Performance Goal.
 
(c)
                                
Notwithstanding Section 4(b), if a Change in Control event occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee's right to receive cash equal to the Target Incentive Amount (as adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(a)) will become nonforfeitable.
 
5
.
                                    
PAYMENT OF AWARDS
.
  Up to and including 200% of the Target Incentive Amount, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 of this Agreement, will be settled in cash only.  Payment will be made to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the Committee's certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may be, which, in the case of payment upon attainment of the Performance Goal, shall be made no later than the 15 day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
.
  Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Grantee.  
 Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of the Company, the Grantee's employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the Company.

TAXES AND WITHHOLDING
.
  The Grantee is responsible for any federal, state (including, as required by applicable law, the state in which the Grantee resides on the Grant Date and the states in which the Grantee resides during the vesting period), local or foreign tax, including income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding with respect to this Return on Equity Incentive Award.  If the Company must withhold any tax in connection with granting or vesting of this Return on Equity Incentive Award, the Grantee by acknowledging this Agreement agrees that, so long as the Grantee is an employee of the Company for tax purposes, all or any part of any such withholding obligation shall be deducted first from cash payable pursuant to this Return on Equity Award and, if not sufficient, then from the Grantee's wages or other cash compensation.  The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
 
9.
                                    
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW
.
  The Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal, state and foreign laws. However, if it is not feasible for the Company to comply with these laws with respect to the grant or settlement of these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any consideration or additional benefits provided to Grantee as a result of the cancellation.

be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company, including the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company. 
Additionally, this
Return on Equity Incentive Award is
not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service awards.
 
The grant of this
Return on Equity Incentive Award
does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of
Return on Equity Incentive Awards
or benefits in lieu of
Return on Equity Incentive Awards
, even if Grantee has a history of receiving
Return on Equity Incentive Awards
or other cash or stock awards.

  The Plan may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Board at any time, as provided in the Plan.  Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent it is applicable to this Agreement; however, no amendment will adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under this Agreement without the Grantee's consent.
 
12.
                             
SEVERABILITY
.
  If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidated provisions shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and fully enforceable.

Except as otherwise required by law or legal process, the Grantee will not publish or divulge to any person, firm, corporation or institution and will not use to the detriment of Occidental, or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders (collectively, "Occidental Parties"), at any time during or after the Grantee's employment by any of them, any trade secrets or confidential information of any of them (whether generated by them or as a result of any of their business relationships), including such information as described in Occidental's Code of Business Conduct and other corporate policies, without first obtaining the written permission of an officer of the Company.
 
B.
                                  
At the time of leaving employment with the Company, the Grantee will deliver to the Company, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all credit cards, drawings, blueprints, specifications, devices, notes, notebooks, memoranda, reports, studies, correspondence and other documents, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the Occidental Parties (whether generated by them or as a result of their business relationships), including any copies (whether in paper or electronic form), that the Grantee has in the Grantee's possession or control.

Nothing herein, however, shall prevent Grantee from making a good faith report or complaint to appropriate governmental authorities.

The provisions of this Section do not apply to an invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides in substance that provisions in an employment agreement providing that an employee shall assign or offer to assign rights in an invention to his or her employer do not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employee's own time, except for those inventions that either (a) relate, at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention, (1) to the business of the employer or (2) to the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

The Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time amend or supplement the foregoing terms.  The Grantee's breach of the foregoing General Terms of Employment will entitle the Company to take appropriate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, reduction of the Return on Equity Incentive Award granted pursuant to this Agreement and termination of employment.
Any dispute arising out of or in any way related to the Grantee's employment with the Company, or the termination of that employment, will be decided exclusively by final and binding arbitration pursuant to any procedures required by applicable law.  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any arbitration will be submitted to American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and subject to AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration.  Only the following claims are excluded from this Agreement: (1) claims for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, or state disability benefits, and claims based upon any pension or welfare benefit plan the terms of which contain an arbitration or other non-judicial dispute resolution procedure, (2) to the extent permitted by applicable law, claims for provisional remedies to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of arbitration, (3) claims based on employee compensation award agreements and incentive plans and (4) claims which are not permitted by applicable law to be subject to a binding pre-dispute arbitration agreement.
 
Any controversy regarding whether a particular dispute is subject to arbitration under this Section shall be decided by the arbitrator.
 
To the extent required under applicable law, the Grantee's responsibility for payment of the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be required for a state trial court action and the Company shall pay all remaining fees and expenses of the arbitrator.  Unless otherwise required under applicable law, the parties shall each pay their pro rata share of the neutral arbitrator's expenses and fees.  Any controversy regarding the payment of fees and expenses under this arbitration provision shall be decided by the arbitrator.
 
The arbitrator may award any form of remedy or relief (including injunctive relief) that would otherwise be available in court.  Any award pursuant to said arbitration shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrator setting forth the reason for the award.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered, and enforcement may be sought in, any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws, the arbitrator will have the authority to hear and grant motions.

OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
2005 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN INCENTIVE AWARD AGREEMENT
 
 
 
THIS AGREEMENT
(this "Agreement") is made as of the Date of Grant between OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Occidental" and, with its subsidiaries, the "Company"), and Grantee.
 
1.
                                    
GRANT OF TARGET PERFORMANCE SHARES
.
  In accordance with this Agreement and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), Occidental grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the right to receive one-half in Shares and one-half in cash up to 150% of the number/value of Target Performance Shares.  For the purposes of this Agreement, "Target Performance Shares" means a bookkeeping entry that records the equivalent of Shares awarded pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Plan that is payable upon the achievement of the Performance Goal. Target Performance Shares are not Shares and have no voting rights or, except as stated in Section 6, dividend rights.
 
2.
                                    
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER.
  Neither this Agreement nor any right to receive Shares or cash pursuant to this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by the Grantee other than (i) to a beneficiary designated on a form approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law), by will or, if the Grantee dies without designating a beneficiary of a valid will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, if applicable, (if approved or ratified by the Committee).
 
3.
                                    
PERFORMANCE GOAL.
  The Performance Goal for the Performance Period is a peer company comparison based on Total Shareholder Return (defined as Total Stockholder Return in the Plan), as set forth on Exhibit 1.  Total Shareholder Return shall be calculated for each peer company using the average of its last reported sale price per share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions for the last ten trading days preceding July 16, 2008 and the average of its last reported sale price per share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions for the last ten trading days preceding July 15, 2012.  The peer companies are: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, BP p.l.c., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell plc.  If a peer company ceases to be a publicly-traded company at any time during the Performance Period or the Committee determines pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement to reflect a change in circumstances with respect to any peer company, then such company will be removed as a peer company and the achievement of the Performance Goal will be determined with respect to the remaining peer companies as set forth on Exhibit 1.
4.
                                    
VESTING AND FORFEITURE OF TARGET PERFORMANCE SHARES
.
  (a) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the last day of the Performance Period to receive payment of this award.  The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantee's employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence.  However, if, prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a "Forfeiture Event"), then the number of Target Performance Shares upon which the Grantee's award is based will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining in the Performance Period following the date of the Forfeiture Event.  If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before the end of the Performance Period, then this Agreement will terminate automatically on the date of Grantee's termination and Grantee shall forfeit the right to receive any Shares or cash hereunder.
 
(b) The Grantee's right to receive payment of this award in an amount not to exceed 150% of the Target Performance Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole share, will be based on, and become nonforfeitable upon the Committee's certification of, the attainment of the Performance Goal.
 
(c) Notwithstanding Section 4(b), if a Change in Control event occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee's right to receive payment at the Target Performance Share level (as adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(a)) will become nonforfeitable.  The right to receive Shares and cash in excess of the Target Performance Share level (as adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(a)) will be forfeited.
 
5.
                                    
PAYMENT OF AWARDS.
  The Target Performance Shares as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 7 of this Agreement will be settled 50% in Shares and 50% in cash.  The cash payment will equal the closing price of the Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the Committee's certification (the "Certification Date Value") of the attainment of the Performance Goal multiplied by 50% of the Target Performance Shares earned at the Performance Goal level attained and will be paid as promptly as possible after such date.  The Shares covered by this Agreement or any prorated portion thereof shall be issued to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the Committee's certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may be.  Each of the cash payment and the Shares shall in any event be made no later than the 15 day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

  With respect to the number of Target Performance Shares listed above, the Grantee will be credited on the books and records of Occidental with an amount (the "Dividend Equivalent") equal to the amount per share of any cash dividends declared by the Board on the outstanding Shares as and when declared during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending with respect to any portion of the Target Performance Shares covered by this Agreement on the date on which the Grantee's right to receive such portion becomes nonforfeitable, or, if earlier, the date on which the Grantee forfeits the right to receive such portion.  Occidental will pay in cash to the Grantee an amount equal to the Dividend Equivalents credited to such Grantee as promptly as may be practicable after the Grantee has been credited with a Dividend Equivalent.

ADJUSTMENTS
.
(a)
                                            
The number of Target Performance Shares or kind of shares of stock covered by this Agreement shall be adjusted as the Committee determines pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Plan in order to prevent dilution or expansion of the Grantee's rights under this Agreement as a result of events such as stock dividends, stock splits or other changes in the capital structure of Occidental, or any merger, consolidation, spin-off, liquidation or other corporate transaction having a similar effect.  If any such adjustment occurs, the Company will give the Grantee written notice of the adjustment.
 
(b) In addition, the Committee may adjust the Performance Goal or other features of this Grant as permitted by Section 5.2.3 of the Plan.
 
8.
                                    
NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.
  Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Grantee.  Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of the Company, the Grantee's employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the Company.
 
9.
                                    
TAXES AND WITHHOLDING.
  The Grantee is responsible for any federal, state (including, as required by applicable law, the state in which the Grantee resides on the Grant Date and the states in which the Grantee resides during the vesting period), local or foreign tax, including income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding with respect to the grant of Target Performance Shares (including the grant, the vesting, the receipt of Shares or cash, the sale of Shares and the receipt of dividends or Dividend Equivalents, if any).  If the Company must withhold any tax in connection with the issuance of any Shares or the payment of cash or any other consideration pursuant to the grant of Target Performance Shares (other than the payment of Dividend Equivalents), the Grantee shall satisfy all or any part of any such withholding obligation equally from any cash amount payable under this Agreement and, from the Shares that are issued or transferred to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Grantee otherwise instructs the Company in writing not less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Performance Period.  Any Shares so surrendered by the Grantee shall be credited against the Grantee's withholding obligation at their Certification Date Value.  If the Company must withhold any tax in connection with granting of Target Performance Shares or the payment of Dividend Equivalents pursuant to this grant of Target Performance Shares, the Grantee by acknowledging this Agreement agrees that, so long as the Grantee is an employee of the Company for tax purposes, all or any part of any such withholding obligation shall be deducted from the Grantee's wages or other cash compensation (including Dividend Equivalents).  The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
 
10.
                             
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.
  The Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws; however, the Company will not issue any Shares or other securities pursuant to this Agreement if their issuance would result in a violation of any such law.  However, if it is not feasible for the Company to comply with such laws with respect to the grant or settlement of these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any compensation or additional benefits provided to Grantee as a result of the cancellation.
 
11.
                             
RELATION TO OTHER BENEFITS.
  The benefits received by the Grantee under this Agreement will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained
by the Company, including the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company.  Additionally, the Target Performance Shares are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service awards.  This grant of Target Performance Shares does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Target Performance Shares, or benefits in lieu of Target Performance Shares, even if Grantee has a history of receiving Target Performance Shares or other stock or cash awards.
 
12.
                             
AMENDMENTS.

Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent it is applicable to this Agreement; however, no amendment will adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under this Agreement without the Grantee's consent.
 
13.
                             
SEVERABILITY.
  If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidated provisions shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions of this Agreement, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue to be valid and fully enforceable.

Example of Total Shareholder Return Payout Calculations
 
Step 1:
  Order Peer Companies by TSR values (excluding Oxy) highest to lowest, assign ordinal values starting at lowest value
 
 
Step 2:
 
Calculate bottom 1/3 threshold
 
n = number of companies (excluding Oxy) = 8
q = (n  1) x (0.33) = (8  1) x (0.33) = 2.31
j = integer portion of q = 2
g = noninteger portion of q = 0.31
Bottom 1/3 = [(1  g) x ordinal value(j+1)] + [(g) x ordinal value(j+2)]
= [(1  g) x (3 ordinal value)] + [(g) x (4 ordinal value)]
rd
th
= [(1  0.31) x (242.0)] + [(0.31) x (253.8)]
= 245.7
 
Step 3:
 
Calculate top 1/3 threshold
 
n = number of companies (excluding Oxy) = 8
q = (n  1)(0.67) = (8 - 1)(0.67) = 4.69
j = integer portion of q = 4
g = noninteger portion of q = 0.69
Top 1/3 = [(1  g) x ordinal value(j+1)] + [(g) x ordinal value(j+2)]
= [(1  g) x (5 ordinal value)] + [(g) x (6 ordinal value)]
th
th
= [(1  0.69) x (257.0)] + [(0.69) x (264.2)]
= 262.0
Step 4:
 
Calculate payout for a specific Oxy TSR result (with payout limited to 150%)
 
If Oxy TSR result is less than or equal to bottom 1/3 then payout = 0%
 
Example:
if Oxy TSR = 240.0, then payout = 0%
 
If Oxy TSR result is greater than or equal to top 1/3, then payout = 150%
 
Example:
if Oxy TSR = 290.3, then payout = 150%
 
If Oxy TSR is between bottom 1/3 and top 1/3 then linearly interpolate as follows:
 
Payout = [(Oxy TSR - bottom 1/3 threshold)  spread between top 1/3 and bottom 1/3] x 150%
 
Example:
if Oxy TSR = 255.5, then payout
= [(255.5  245.7)  (262.0  245.7)] x 150%
= 90%

Except as otherwise required by law or legal process, the Grantee will not publish or divulge to any person, firm, corporation or institution and will not use to the detriment of Occidental, or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders (collectively, "Occidental Parties"), at any time during or after the Grantee's employment by any of them, any trade secrets or confidential information of any of them (whether generated by them or as a result of any of their business relationships), including such information as described in Occidental's Code of Business Conduct and other corporate policies, without first obtaining the written permission of an officer of the Company.
 
B.

The foregoing General Terms of Employment are not intended to be an exclusive list of the employment terms and conditions that apply to the Grantee.  The Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time amend or supplement the foregoing terms.  The Grantee's breach of the foregoing General Terms of Employment will entitle the Company to take appropriate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, reduction of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award granted pursuant to this Agreement and termination of employment.
Any dispute arising out of or in any way related to the Grantee's employment with the Company, or the termination of that employment, will be decided exclusively by final and binding arbitration pursuant to any procedures required by applicable law.

To the extent required under applicable law, the Grantee's responsibility for payment of the neutral arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be required for a state trial court action and the Company shall pay all remaining fees and expenses of the arbitrator.  Unless otherwise required under applicable law, the parties shall each pay their pro rata share of the neutral arbitrator's expenses and fees.  Any controversy regarding the payment of fees and expenses under this arbitration provision shall be decided by the arbitrator.
 
The arbitrator may award any form of remedy or relief (including injunctive relief) that would otherwise be available in court.  Any award pursuant to said arbitration shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrator setting forth the reason for the award.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered, and enforcement may be sought in, any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws, the arbitrator will have the authority to hear and grant motions.
