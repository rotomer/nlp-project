as Representatives of the several Underwriters
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with the underwriters listed on Schedule A hereto (collectively the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 11 hereof) with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective principal amounts of Notes set forth opposite their names on Schedule A hereto.  The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 1, 1998 (the "Indenture," which term, for purposes of this Agreement, shall include an Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture with respect to the Notes delivered pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee").  Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. shall be the representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives;" in the event that there is only one such representative, then all references herein to the "Representatives" shall be deemed to mean and refer to such single representative, mutatis mutandis).
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-152875) and, if applicable, one or more amendments and post-effective amendments thereto, for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations").  Such registration statement (as amended, if applicable), and each post-effective amendment thereto (if any) became effective
upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(e) of the 1933 Act Regulations, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act").  Such registration statement (as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto and any other amendments thereto) and the prospectus dated August 11, 2008 (the "Base Prospectus") together with the final prospectus supplement dated October 16, 2008 (the "Final Prospectus Supplement") filed by the Company relating to the Notes, including, in each case, all Incorporated Documents (as hereinafter defined) and, solely in the case of any such registration statement, the information that is deemed pursuant to Rule 430B of the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of such registration statement ("Rule 430B Information"), are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively, except that, if any revised prospectus or prospectus supplement filed by the Company shall be provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes  (including, without limitation, for delivery upon request of purchasers of Notes pursuant to Rule 173 of the 1933 Act Regulations), the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus or prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use.  As used herein, the term "preliminary prospectus" means any prospectus supplement filed by the Company relating to the Notes that is captioned "Subject to Completion" or "preliminary prospectus supplement" or that has a similar caption, together with the Base Prospectus, including all Incorporated Documents, it being understood that all references herein to a "preliminary prospectus" shall include, without limitation, the Statutory Prospectus (as defined below).  Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents, financial statements and schedules incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference therein (other than information in such documents, financial statements and schedules that is deemed not to be filed) pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, and any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents, financial statements and schedules filed by the Company with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and so incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference (other than information in such documents, financial statements and schedules that is deemed not to be filed) (such incorporated documents, financial statements and schedules being herein called the "Incorporated Documents").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement any prospectus supplement prepared or filed with respect to an offering pursuant to the Registration Statement of any securities other than the Notes shall not be deemed to have supplemented any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and the information therein shall not be deemed Rule 430B Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus, or to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus or Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus (as such terms are hereinafter defined), or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
 
The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Notes as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any such stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.  The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) (i) of the 1933 Act Regulations and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the 1933 Act Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)).

Notice of Certain Events
 
.  So long as the Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the 1933 Act Regulations) in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes, the Company will give the Underwriters advance notice of its intention to file any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto became effective or

.  The Company will deliver to each of the Underwriters one signed and as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto relating to the Notes (including the Incorporated Documents and any exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein) as the Underwriters may reasonably request.  The Company will furnish to the Underwriters as many copies of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses as the Underwriters shall reasonably request so long as the Underwriters are required to deliver a Prospectus (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the 1933 Act Regulations) in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes.

If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters and will promptly amend or supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.

(ii)
          
 
  The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Underwriters (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company pursuant to Rule 433; that the Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering, (ii) information that describes the final terms of the Notes or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet contemplated in Section 4(g) of this Agreement or (iii) contains other customary information that (in the case of this clause (iii) only) is not "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to as aforesaid is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus," and it is hereby agreed that the Final Term Sheet is a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.

Indemnification of the Underwriters
 
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (c) below, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, insofar as such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arises out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(i)
           
 
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (c) below, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever, insofar as such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(ii)
          
 
against any and all expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (c) below, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission;

(c)
          
General
 
In case any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought against the Company, any of the Company's directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, with respect to which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to this Section 7, such Underwriter
(ii)
          
 
shall have the rights and duties given to the Company by subsection (c)(i) of this Section 7 with respect thereto (provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any authorization of the nature specified in clause (A) of subsection (c)(i) of this Section 7 may be given only by the Representatives and copies of all notices given by the Company of the nature specified in such subsection (c)(i) of this Section 7 shall also be sent to the Representatives), and the Company, the Company's directors and officers and any such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by subsection (c)(i) of this Section 7 with respect thereto.
 
Contribution.
SECTION 8.
              
 
In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable with respect to the indemnified parties, although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the Underwriters, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, on the other hand, bear to the total price to public of the Notes as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto, and not joint.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed by the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 8, each affiliate of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  Any party entitled to contribution hereunder
 
will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this Section 8, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought (with, in the case of any notice given by the Company or any of its officers, directors or controlling persons, a copy to the Representatives), but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have otherwise than under this Section 8.
 
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery.
SECTION 9.
              
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any affiliate of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company, issued and to be issued pursuant to the Indenture. This Note is one of a series designated by the Company as its 7% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"), limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000.  The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
 
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 1, 1998 (herein called the "Indenture" which term, for the purpose of this Note, shall include the Officers' Certificate dated October 21, 2008, delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture) to the Bank of New York, the original trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may, from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Notes, reopen this series of Notes and issue additional Notes.
 
The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined herein) plus 50 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of the Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of the Indenture.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the
 
remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, such average in any case to be determined by the Quotation Agent, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.
 
"Quotation Agent" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers) and their respective successors; , that if any of them shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer or Dealers selected by the Company.
provided, however
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day in The City of New York preceding such Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price (or any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes or portions thereof to be redeemed), on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.  If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal
amount hereof will be issued in authorized denominations in the name of the Holder hereof upon surrender hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of this Note shall relate, in the case that this Note is redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to that portion of the principal amount of this Note that has been or is to be redeemed.

The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities.  The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Four of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The Indenture permits the Company, by irrevocably depositing cash or U.S. Government Obligations, in amounts and maturities sufficient to pay and discharge at the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be, the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Notes, with the Trustee in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of all Outstanding Notes, to defease the Indenture with respect to the Notes (subject to specified exceptions), and upon such deposit and satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged its entire indebtedness on the Notes.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon
one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, but, to the extent permitted by applicable law, not the laws as to conflicts or choice of law, of the State of New York.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
