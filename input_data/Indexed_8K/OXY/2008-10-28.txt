Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On October 28, 2008, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $2.271 billion ($2.78 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $1.324 billion ($1.58 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2007.
 
QUARTERLY RESULTS
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $3.618 billion for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $1.955 billion for the same period in 2007. The $1.7 billion increase in the third quarter 2008 segment earnings reflected $1.8 billion of increases from higher crude oil and natural gas prices, higher oil and gas production and lower exploration expense, partially offset by increased DD&A rates and higher operating expenses.
 
For the third quarter of 2008, daily oil and gas production averaged 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 570,000 BOE per day produced in the third quarter of 2007. The bulk of the production increase was the result of 31,000 BOE per day higher production from the Dolphin project, which began production in the third quarter of 2007, partially offset by 5,000 BOE per day lower production resulting from Hurricane Ike and 13,000 BOE per day lower production in Libya as a result of the new contract that became effective in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $104.15 per barrel for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $67.81 per barrel for the third quarter of 2007. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $5.90 per MCF in the third quarter of 2007 to $9.35 per MCF for the third quarter of 2008.
 
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $219 million, compared with $212 million for the same period in 2007. The third quarter of 2008 results reflect higher caustic soda margins, partially offset by lower volumes and margins for chlorine and polyvinyl chloride.
 
 
1
 
Midstream, Marketing and Other
 
Midstream segment earnings were $66 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared with $86 million for the third quarter of 2007. The third quarter of 2008 reflects lower margins in crude oil marketing, partially offset by higher pipeline income from Dolphin, which came on line in the second half of 2007, and higher margins in gas processing and power generation.
 
NINE MONTHS RESULTS
 
Net income for the nine months of 2008 was $6.414 billion ($7.79 per diluted share), compared with $3.948 billion ($4.69 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2007.
 
Core results were $6.391 billion ($7.76 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2008, compared with $2.941 billion ($3.50 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2007. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net income to core results.
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $10.312 billion for the nine months of 2008, compared with $5.496 billion for the same period of 2007. Oil and gas core results were $4.908 billion for the nine months of 2007 after excluding a $412 million gain from the sale of Occidental's Russian joint venture interests, a $35 million gain from the sale of other oil and gas interests, $112 million income from the resolution of certain legal disputes and a $29 million gain from the sale of exploration properties, net of impairments. The $5.4 billion increase in the 2008 core results from $4.9 billion in 2007 reflected $5.5 billion from higher crude oil and natural gas prices, increased oil and gas production and lower exploration expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses and increased DD&A rates.
 
Daily oil and gas production for the first nine months was 594,000 BOE per day for 2008, compared with 563,000 BOE per day for the same 2007 period. The 5.5 percent increase was largely the result of 44,000 BOE per day higher production from the Dolphin project, partially offset by 5,000 BOE per day lower production in Libya resulting from the new contract.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $100.39 per barrel for the nine months of 2008, compared with $59.47 per barrel for the nine months of 2007. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $6.45 per MCF in the nine months of 2007 to $9.18 per MCF in the nine months of 2008.
 
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings were $542 million for the nine months of 2008, compared with $507 million for the nine months of 2007. The 2008 results reflect higher margins for caustic soda, partially offset by lower volumes and margins for chlorine and polyvinyl chloride.
 
Midstream, Marketing and Other
 
Midstream segment earnings were $350 million for the nine months of 2008, compared with $229 million for the same period in 2007. The improvement in 2008 reflected higher pipeline income from the Dolphin Pipeline and higher margins in gas processing and power generation, partially offset by lower margins in crude oil marketing.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 Conference Call 
Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Announcement
 
October 28, 2008
Los Angeles, California
 
 
Thank you Chris.
We will discuss earnings details in a few minutes; however, we wanted to start with cash flows and our balance sheet.
Cash flow from operations for the nine months of 2008 was $8.1 billion. We used $3.2 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $3.3 billion for acquisitions and $680 million to pay dividends. We spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 19.4 million common shares. These and other net cash outflows decreased our $2.0 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $550 million to $1.45 billion at September 30. Debt was $1.8 billion at the end of September, which was unchanged from December 31, 2007. Our debt to total capitalization rate is 6 percent.
Next year we have maturities totaling $714 million, after that we have maturities of $239 million in 2010 and $368 million in 2012. We ended the quarter with $1.45 billion cash on the balance sheet, we recently borrowed $1 billion which could be used to cover debt maturities and we will pay
 
$1.25 billion for the Plains transaction. We have available unused lines of committed bank credit of $1.5 billion. A pro forma debt to total capitalization rate with the recent debt issued was 9 percent or about $0.98 per BOE of proved reserves.
Occidental generates significant cash flows over a wide range of prices as noted in the Cash Flow Available for Capital and Other Uses slide included in the Investor Relations package. For example, in 2005 when WTI oil prices were $57 a barrel and production from continuing operations was 466,000 BOE per day, we had free cash flow of $2 billion after spending $2.295 billion for capital expenditures and $483 million for dividends. Cash flow from continuing operations is after interest and income taxes. Continuing operations excludes production from Russia, Horn Mountain, Ecuador and Pakistan. If you adjust for the 2005 dividends of $483 million and $131 million net interest expense and current 2008 annualized amounts of $912 million for dividends and interest expense, we would have cash flow available for capital spending in excess of $3.9 billion. This is after removing Horn Mountain, Ecuador, Russia and Pakistan from the 2005 numbers. The increase in production is primarily from Dolphin, Argentina, and domestic additions. These new programs on average generate more cash flow than the programs they replaced. The difference between the 1st nine months run rate of 594,000 BOE per day and 466,000 BOE per day of 2005 is about 45,000,000 BOE per year. Using the production outlook we gave you last quarter of about 650,000 BOE per day the difference is about 200,000 BOE per day or about 70 million barrels per year.
Therefore, we would have well over $3.9 billion in cash available for capital expenditures at the 2005 $57 per barrel WTI price.
Let me now begin discussion of the
third quarter earnings.

Net income for the quarter was $2.3 billion, or $2.78 per diluted share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007 when oil prices were $75 per barrel.
Here's the segment breakdown for the quarter.
Oil and gas third quarter 2008 segment earnings were $3.618 billion, compared to $1.955 billion for the third quarter of 2007. Oil and gas core results for the third quarter of 2007 were $1.914 billion, after excluding gains from the sale of oil and gas interests and exploration properties. The following accounted for the increase in oil and gas earnings between these quarters:
 
 
3
 
Oil and gas cash production costs for the first nine months of 2008 were $14.80 a barrel compared to last year's costs of $12.33 a barrel. Approximately 38 percent of the increase is related to increased energy costs. The increases reflected higher production taxes and ad valorem taxes, workovers and field operating costs.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $219 million, which was higher than our guidance of $135 million to $150 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher caustic soda price. Chemicals earned $212 million in last year's third quarter.
Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $66 million, a decrease of $20 million from the third quarter of 2007 results. The decline in earnings was due to lower crude oil marketing margins, partially offset by higher pipeline income from Dolphin, higher NGL margins in the gas processing business and improved margins on the power generation side.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent for the third quarter of 2008.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the .
first nine months
Net income was $6.414 billion, or $7.79 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2008, compared with $3.948 billion, or $4.69 per diluted share for the same period of 2007. The nine months 2008 reported net income was another record and was 62 percent higher than the first nine months of 2007 net income. Income for the first nine months of 2007
 
 
4
 
included $1 billion benefit, net of tax, for the items noted on the schedule reconciling net income to core results.
Capital spending was $1.2 billion for the quarter and $3.2 billion for the first nine months. We expect our total capital spending for the year to be about $4.5 to $4.7 billion. Our preliminary estimate is that next year's capital spending will be no greater than this years.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months were 820.1 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 823.8 million. At September 30, there were 810.1 million basic shares outstanding and the diluted share amount was approximately 813.8 million.
Oxy's 2008 annualized return on equity was 34 percent, with annualized return on capital employed of 32 percent.

Third Quarter 2008 Earnings  Oil & Gas Segment
3Q08
3Q07
Oil and Gas Production (mboe/d)
588
570
+3.2% year-over-year
Improvement largely due to:
the Dolphin Project (+31 mboe/d);
Partially offset by:
Lower volumes attributable to Hurricane Ike (-5 mboe/d), and;
Lower volumes from Libya operations due to the new contract (-13 mboe/d).
Exploration expense was $61 mm in 3Q08, below our guidance of $90 to $110 million.
Oil and Gas production costs were $14.80 per boe through nine months of 2008 vs. $12.33 per boe for full-year 2007.
Approximately 38% of the increase is related to increased energy costs reflecting higher production taxes and ad valorem taxes.  Higher costs were also a function of increased workovers and field operating costs.

Third Quarter 2008 Earnings  4Q08 Outlook
We expect oil and gas production to be in the range of 610 to 625 mboe/d in 4Q08, at approximately current oil prices.
Production increases are expected from:
Middle East and North Africa, reflecting lower prices on our PSCs;
Our domestic operations, and;
Argentina
Commodity Price Sensitivity  Earnings
A $40 per barrel decrease in oil prices from 3Q08 would reduce 4Q08 pre-tax Oil and Gas earnings by about $1.5 billion.
Further changes of $5 per barrel in oil prices will impact Oil and Gas quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $190 million.
A $3.00 per mm BTUs decline in domestic gas prices from 3Q08 would decrease Oil and Gas quarterly pre-tax earnings by $140 million.
We expect 4Q08 exploration expense to be about $150 million.

Third Quarter 2008 Earnings - 4Q08 Outlook
We expect 4Q08 Chemical earnings to be about $150 million.
High caustic soda prices are expected to continue through the period;
Partially offset by weakness in the construction and housing markets impacting domestic demand;
Despite difficult economic conditions, a seasonally weak fourth quarter and concerns over export opportunities over the balance of the year, we believe this approximate earnings amount is likely.
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate to be about 44% in 4Q08.
The expected sequential increase in the rate is due to proportionally higher foreign source income and higher anticipated currently non- deductible foreign exploration.
