2008 Reserve Replacement
We estimate that we replaced approximately 200% of our oil and gas production in 2008.  
This excludes the effect of price changes from 2007 to 2008.
Including the effect of price changes, we estimate that we replaced around 150% of our 2008 production.
Slightly over half of the 2008 reserve additions, excluding effect of price changes, came from internal sources resulting in over 100% reserve replacement.
Major reserve increases were in:
the California properties;
the Permian and the Rockies, and;
Oman.
In aggregate, these areas constituted more than half of such reserve adds.

Capital Allocation Philosophy
New projects must meet expectations for good returns
Return Targets*
Domestic  15+%
International  20+%
Compare new projects and asset acquisitions with share repurchases
Pursue only those opportunities which meet our standards for ROCE and complement our existing assets
Make decisions based on creating long-term value for shareholders
*Assumes Moderate Product Prices

9
Capital Spending Program
2008 capital program was about $4.7 billion, and we spent another $4.7 billion for acquisitions.
As a result, we have accumulated a sizeable inventory of projects which can be delayed until the industry cost structure is in line with product prices.
2009 capital program of $3.5 billion will focus on ensuring that our returns remain well above our cost of capital given current oil and gas prices and contractor costs.
Service company cost structure is more reflective of an $80 oil environment rather than a $40 one.
About 80% of the capital will be in Oil and Gas and the remainder in Midstream and Chemical.
An illustration of our ability to defer drilling is that we have 5 mm net acres in the US;
70% of this acreage is held by production;
about 10% consists of long-term leases, with many years on average to run, and;
the remainder is in mineral acres held in perpetuity.
9
 
10
Capital Spending Program
Gas drilling with less than $5 per mcf gas is unattractive.
We will continue to fully fund much of our Middle East operations, successful exploration programs in California, Utah, and exploration in Argentina.
Formerly "quick payout" wells in the Permian and California will be deferred until they become "quick payout" again.
We will continue to fund our Midstream and CO programs.
2
Expect our capital run rate in 1Q09 to be greater than the $3.5 billion level and will decline all year unless economic conditions improve.
The effect of this program on our production should be modest in 2009, around 10 mboe/d, with a probable production range of 620 to 660 mboe/d and, with about 630 to 650 mboe/d in 1Q09.
Year-over-year, Argentina and Oman will show the most growth.
10
 
11
Capital Spending Program
We are renegotiating our supplier contracts to further reduce costs and are laying down rigs, including paying cancellation costs when that makes sense.
We expect these efforts to result in a reduction in the cost of executing our capital programs, as well as, a reduction of our operating expenses.
When costs and prices are inline, our capital program will be boosted and the project inventory worked down faster.
We are also focusing on internal costs.
Some reductions in overhead will be made this year which should improve our overhead levels by at least $1/boe.
Oxy's focus has been and will continue to be delivering returns well in excess of our cost of capital.

Statements in this presentation that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results.  Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; exploration risks such as drilling of unsuccessful wells, higher than expected costs; operational interruptions; political risks; changes in tax rates; unrealized acquisition benefits or higher than expected integration costs; and not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansion, capital expenditure, acquisition or disposition.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this presentation.  Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Additionally, the SEC requires oil and natural gas companies, in their filings, to disclose non-financial statistical information about their consolidated entities separately from such information about their equity holdings and not to show combined totals.  The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions.  We use certain terms in this presentation, such as price unadjusted reserves, that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from using in filings with the SEC.  Certain information in this presentation is shown on a combined basis; however, the information is disclosed separately on our web site at
