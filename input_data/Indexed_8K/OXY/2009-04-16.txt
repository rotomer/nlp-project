Proposed By-law Revision
 
Occidental is currently soliciting proxies from stockholders to approve an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to permit holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding common stock to call a special meeting of stockholders. In that connection, the Board approved By-law procedures to be followed in the event that the amendment is approved and then a special meeting is requested. The By-law procedures are set forth in Exhibit C to the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
 
Clause (b)(iii) of the By-law procedures provides that the Secretary shall not be required to call such a special meeting if an annual or special meeting was held within the prior twelve months for the same purpose, as determined by the Board.
 
In order to resolve a concern that Clause (b)(iii) of the By-law procedures might inhibit the calling of such a special meeting, management will recommend to the Board that the procedures be revised to delete Clause (b)(iii).
