Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On April 23, 2009, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced that its net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $368 million ($0.45 per diluted share). Results for the quarter were impacted by certain non-core charges. Core results for the first quarter of 2009 were $407 million ($0.50 per diluted share).
 
Oil and Gas
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $545 million for the first quarter of 2009. After excluding rig termination costs of $8 million, the first quarter 2009 core results were $553 million, compared with $2.9 billion for the same period in 2008. The $2.3 billion decrease in the first quarter 2009 results reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates.
 
For the first quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 654,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 607,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2008. Volume increases were 22,000 BOE per day in domestic operations, largely in the Rockies and California, 15,000 BOE per day in Oman, and 10,000 BOE per day in Argentina.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $39.29 per barrel for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $86.75 per barrel for the first quarter of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $8.15 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in the first quarter of 2008 to $3.54 per MCF for the first quarter of 2009.
 
Oil and gas cash production costs, including taxes  other than on income, declined from $14.75 per BOE for the total year 2008 to $12.19 per BOE for the first quarter of 2009.
 
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $169 million, compared with $179 million for the same period in 2008. The first quarter of 2009 results reflect higher caustic soda margins, offset by lower volumes in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride.
 
 
1
 
Midstream, Marketing and Other
 
Midstream segment earnings were $14 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared with $123 million for the first quarter of 2008. The earnings decline for the first quarter of 2009 reflects significantly lower NGL prices in the gas processing business and negative mark to market adjustments in crude oil marketing.

Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "In the first quarter, Occidental achieved a nearly eight percent growth in year-over-year oil and gas production. In addition, we have made significant progress in our continuing cost reduction efforts and we will continue to invest in the long-term growth of the Company. I am pleased with our effectiveness in adjusting to the ongoing volatile market conditions."

 Conference Call 
First Quarter 2009 Earnings Announcement
 
April 23, 2009
Los Angeles, California
 
 
Thank you Chris.
Net income for the quarter was $368 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $1.8 billion, or $2.22 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. The 2009 first quarter net income includes after-tax non-core charges of $39 million, including $21 million for severance, $10 million for railcar leases, $5 million for rig termination costs and $3 million for discontinued operations. Core results were $407 million, or $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $1.8 billion, or $2.19 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008.
Here's the segment breakdown for the .
first quarter
Oil and gas first quarter 2009 segment earnings were $545 million. After excluding the rig termination costs, the first quarter 2009 core results were $553 million, compared to $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2008.
 
 
 
2
 
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $169 million, compared to our guidance of $100 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher caustic soda margins. Chemicals earned $179 million in last year's first quarter.
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $14 million, compared to $123 million in the first quarter of 2008. The decline in earnings was due to significantly lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business and negative mark to market adjustments in crude oil marketing.
 
 
3
 
for the first quarter of 2009 included a $32 million pre-tax charge for severance. We do not expect to record any material additional amounts in 2009. Additionally, we recorded a $15 million pre-tax charge related to railcar sub-leases to Lyondell, which are being restructured as a result of Lyondell entering into bankruptcy.
Non-core adjustments
The worldwide effective tax rate was 39 percent for the first quarter of 2009, compared with our guidance of 46 percent. The decrease in rate reflects tax benefits resulting from the relinquishment of international exploration contracts. Occidental generally records no tax benefit on foreign expensed exploration until the project is relinquished.
for the first quarter of 2009 was $1.1 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter guidance, our capital run rate in the first quarter of 2009 is greater than the $3.5 billion total year level and will decline throughout the year. We expect that the second quarter capital will be in line with a $3.5 billion annual run rate.
Capital spending
for the three months of 2009 was about $1.3 billion, before working capital changes. We used about $500 million for payments related to higher capital spending and other operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 which were accrued at yearend. We used $1.2 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures and acquisition costs and $260 million to pay dividends. Based on our annual capital spending forecast, we expect our second quarter capital run rate to drop by about $300 million. The higher first quarter 2009 capital run rate, the payments related to the fourth quarter 2008 capital and other net cash outflows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.1 billion at March 31.

First Quarter 2009 Earnings  Oil & Gas Segment California Exploration
Oxy has drilled 35 wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon bearing zones in CA over the course of a little over a year.
Of these wells, 13 are commercial and 12 are currently being evaluated.
Four of these wells currently account for approximately 28 mmcf/d feet of gas and 3 mb/d of gross liquids production.
While too early to speculate on the ultimate reserves and production tied to this activity, it is progressing nicely.
We will continue to invest in this program despite weak natural gas prices as we currently believe that total costs (F&D and lifting) will be less than $10 per boe.
We expect to drill approximately 20 exploration wells in CA this year.
Oxy holds approximately 1.1 mm acres of net fee minerals and leasehold in CA which have been acquired mostly in the last few years to exploit these opportunities.

First Quarter 2009 Earnings  Oil & Gas Segment Cash Production Costs and Taxes
Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.48 per boe in 1Q09.
This represents a 13.6% decline from 2008 full-year costs of $12.13 per boe.
This decline is due to lower workover, maintenance and utilities costs, and the effect of higher PSC volumes.
These lower costs are in line with our 4Q08 guidance where we indicated we are actively renegotiating our supplier contracts and laying down rigs.
Taxes  other than on income were $1.71 per boe for 1Q09 vs. $2.62 per boe for all of 2008.
These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices during 1Q09.

$15 mm pre-tax charge related to railcar sub-leases to Lyondell, which are being restructured as a result of Lyondell entering into bankruptcy.
Worldwide effective tax rate was 39% in 1Q09 vs. our guidance of 46%
Decrease in rate reflects tax benefits from the relinquishment of international exploration contracts;
Oxy generally records no tax benefit on foreign expensed exploration until the project is relinquished.
Capital spending was $1.1 B in 1Q09
As noted on our 4Q08 conference call, our capital run rate in 1Q09 is greater than the $3.5 B full year level, and will decline throughout 2009;
We expect our 2Q09 capital run rate to drop by about $300 mm, and that this rate will be in line with the $3.5 B annual run rate.

First Quarter 2009 Earnings  2Q09 Outlook
We expect oil and gas production sales volumes to be in the range of 640 to 660 mboe/d in 2Q09 at current oil prices.
This volume range reflects increases in Dolphin, Oman, and Qatar.
Commodity Price Sensitivity - Earnings
At current market prices, a $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 mm;
A change of $0.50 per mmBTU in domestic gas prices has a $20 mm impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes;
Although current NYMEX gas price is around $3.70 per mmBTU, gas prices in the Permian and California are currently about $3.00 per mmBTU, while Rockies gas is in the $2.50 per mmBTU range.
We expect 2Q09 exploration expense to be about $60 mm for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.
 
 
13
 
14
First Quarter 2009 Earnings  2Q09 Outlook
We expect 2Q09 Chemical earnings to be $100 mm.
Weakness in the global alumina and pulp & paper markets are expected to result in reduced demand and margins for caustic soda;
Domestically, weak construction and housing markets are expected to continue to reduce demand levels for vinyl.
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate to be about 43% in 2Q09, at current oil prices.

15
First Quarter 2009 Earnings 
Change In Contract Terms
We continue to negotiate cost reductions across all areas including, but not limited to, drilling rigs, service rigs, drilling services, artificial lift, MRO, chemicals and OCTG.
On average, in the current price environment, we expect a 20% to 25% reduction across all areas from the 2008 peak levels.
The effect of these reductions is not yet in the 1Q09 run rate.
We have realized about one third of the reductions that we need to achieve in the current price environment, and we expect the full effect to be realized over the balance of 2009 and into 2010.
These cost reductions impact both capital spending and operating costs.
