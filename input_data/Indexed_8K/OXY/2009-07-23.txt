For Immediate Release: July 23, 2009
Occidental Petroleum Announces Net Income for Second Quarter and First Six Months of 2009
LOS ANGELES, July 23, 2009 - -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income of $682 million ($0.84 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $2.3 billion ($2.78 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2008.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Occidental achieved year-over-year production growth of 10 percent in the second quarter and nearly nine percent in the six months of 2009. Our discovery in Kern County, California which was announced yesterday should also contribute to our future growth."
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $3.8 billion for the same period in 2008. The decrease in the second quarter 2009 segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating expenses.
For the second quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 649,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 588,000 BOE sold in the second quarter of 2008. Volumes increased by approximately 3 percent domestically, mainly from California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by about 37 percent in Latin America mostly in Argentina, and by 16 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely in Oman and Dolphin. California volumes included increases in Long Beach resulting from economic arrangements similar to a production sharing contract and production from new exploration wells in Elk Hills.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $52.97 per barrel for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $110.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.99 per MCF in the second quarter of 2008 to $2.87 per MCF for the second quarter of 2009.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter 2009 were $115 million, compared with $144 million for the same period in 2008. The second quarter of 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride. The lower volumes were partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.
Midstream, Marketing and Other
Midstream segment earnings were $63 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared with $161 million for the second quarter of 2008. The second quarter of 2009 earnings reflect lower margins in the gas processing, marketing, and power generation businesses.
SIX MONTH RESULTS
Net income for the six months of 2009 was $1.1 billion ($1.29 per diluted share), compared with $4.1 billion ($5.00 per diluted share) for the six months of 2008.
Core results were $1.1 billion ($1.34 per diluted share) for the six months of 2009, compared with $4.1 billion ($4.97 per diluted share) for the six months of 2008.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.6 billion for the six months of 2009, compared with $6.7 billion for the same period of 2008. The decrease in segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by increased sales volumes and lower operating and administrative costs.
Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the first six months was 651,000 BOE for 2009, compared with 598,000 BOE per day for the same 2008 period. Volumes increased by approximately 4 percent
 
 
2
domestically mainly from California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by about 26 percent in Latin America mostly in Argentina, and by 11 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely due to Oman and Dolphin. Higher volumes in domestic assets included production from new exploration wells in California.
Oxy's worldwide crude oil realized price was $46.05 per barrel for the six months of 2009, compared with $98.16 per barrel for the six months of 2008. Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.09 per MCF in the six months of 2008 to $3.20 per MCF in the six months of 2009.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the six months of 2009 were $284 million, compared with $323 million for the same period of 2008. The 2009 six month results reflect lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride due to the economic slowdown, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.
Midstream, Marketing and Other
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the six months of 2009, compared with $284 million for the same period in 2008. The earnings decline in 2009 reflects lower margins in the gas processing, power generation, and marketing businesses.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 Conference Call 
Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Announcement
 
July 23, 2009
Los Angeles, California
 
 
 
Thank you, Chris, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.
 
After yesterday's market close, we announced a significant discovery of oil and gas reserves in Kern County, California. We believe it to be the largest new oil and gas discovery made in the state in more than 35 years.
 
This new field discovery, within the outlined area of the six wells we have drilled to date, contains 150 million to 250 million gross barrels equivalent of oil and gas reserves. We believe it is probable that there are additional reserves outside the outlined area. Mr. Steve Chazen will give you more details about this exciting program later on.
 
It is also possible that there are similar accumulations elsewhere in Oxy's 1.1 million-acre net leasehold and fee mineral holdings in California.
 
Let me share with you how we got to our current exciting and rewarding position.
 
Oxy has been a California oil and gas producer for more than 50 years. Our most significant expansion was in 1998, with our acquisition of the Elk Hills field from the U.S. government.
 
When Elk Hills was acquired by Oxy in 1998 it had approximately 425 million BOE of proved reserves. Since then, it has produced more than 364 million BOE. Yet  as a result of the technology applied by Oxy over the past
 
 
1
11 years we have actually been able to its proved reserves to more than 491 million BOE today. The total production and proved reserves since Oxy acquired the Elk Hills field is approaching one BOE.
increase
billion
 
In the years immediately following the Elk Hills acquisition, we purchased THUMS, our operation in Long Beach Harbor, followed by our acquisition of a number of additional California properties. Those include oil and gas assets from Vintage Petroleum, Plains, Tidelands in Long Beach near THUMS, as well as other properties.
 
Oxy's current combined California assets include more than 7,500 active wells located in 90 fields spanning 600 miles. They are currently producing approximately 130,000 BOE per day, 71 percent of which is oil, and at year-end 2008 had approximately 708 million BOE of proved reserves. California represents approximately 20 percent of Oxy's worldwide production.
 
Oxy is currently the third-largest oil producer in California and the largest natural gas producer. We see additional potential in our California holdings by our applying current technologies and the newest thinking to exploration and production. We have invested in California exploration accordingly, and we expect this activity to continue for the next five to ten years.
 
Oxy's California and U.S. exploration and production program is part of an overall effort to build a pipeline of growth projects in keeping with our long-term strategy for increasing stockholder value. In addition, we continue to grow in our other core regions.
 
Oxy's presence and production in the Middle East  currently producing approximately 186,000 BOE per day or 29 percent of our total production  continues to expand.
 
In recent months we have signed new agreements in Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Oman, where we have an agreement to develop four gas fields in a newly formed contract area. First production at those assets is expected in the near future.
 
 
2
Also in Oman, production at the Mukhaizna oil field, where we have a large-scale steam flood project, is meeting its targets and growing. We are on pace to achieve an exit rate of 80,000 barrels per day at the close of 2009.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to give you our second quarter financial results and other details.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Announcement
 
July 23, 2009
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you Ray.
Net income was $682 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2008.
Here's the segment breakdown for the .
second quarter
Oil and gas second quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.1 billion, compared to $3.8 billion for the second quarter of 2008.
 
 
4
 
 
5
Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.32 a barrel for the first six months of 2009, a 15 percent decline from last year's twelve-month costs of $12.13 a barrel. In the second quarter of 2009, Oil & Gas cash production costs declined to $10.17 per BOE, compared to the first quarter of 2009 run rate of $10.48 per BOE. These declines are due to lower workover, maintenance and utilities costs and for the change from prior year, the effect of higher production sharing volumes. The lower costs reflect our continued cost reduction efforts.
Taxes  other than on income were $1.76 per barrel for the first six months of 2009 compared to $2.62 per barrel for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in the first half of 2009. In the second quarter of 2009 these taxes increased to $1.82 per BOE, compared to the first quarter of 2009 rate of $1.71 per BOE, due to higher crude oil prices.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $115 million, compared to our guidance of $100 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher than expected chlorine pricing. Chemicals earned $144 million in last year's second quarter.
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $63 million, compared to $161 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decline in earnings was due to lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business, lower earnings in crude oil marketing and reduced margins in the power generation business.
 
 
6
The worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent for the second quarter of 2009, compared with our guidance of 43 percent. The decrease in rate reflects a higher proportion of expected total year domestic source pre-tax income.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the .
first six months
Net income was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2009, compared with $4.1 billion for the first six months of 2008.
for the second quarter of 2009 was $831 million and $1.9 billion for the first six months. We currently anticipate total year 2009 capital spending to be at $3.6 billion. The $100 million increase from our last estimate is mostly allocated to foreign Oil & Gas locations.
Capital spending
for the six months of 2009 was $2.2 billion. We used $2.4 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and signing bonus payments in Libya and Oman and $520 million to pay dividends. In the second quarter we issued $750 million of 4.125% senior notes due in 2016, with net proceeds from the offering of $740 million. The cash balance at June 30 was $1.8 billion.
Cash flow from operations
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months were 810.8 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.7 million.
As we look ahead in the :

commercial and 16 are currently being evaluated. We expect to drill an additional 8 exploration wells in 2009. Occidental holds 1.1 million acres of net fee minerals and leasehold in California, which have been acquired in the last few years to exploit these opportunities. Discoveries similar to the Kern County discovery are possible in this net acre position. Additionally, we continue to pursue shale production which is expected to produce oil on this acreage.
 
 
9
million to drill and complete and have payout periods of less than six months. The combined finding, development and lifting costs are expected to be significantly less than $10 per BOE. We will also need to expand our 400 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in Elk Hills to accommodate the expected production from this Kern County discovery. Our overall working and revenue interest in this discovery is about 80%.
Now we're ready to take your questions.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings  3Q09 Outlook
We expect 3Q09 oil and gas sales volumes to be similar to 2Q09, at about current oil prices.
This volume range reflects decreases from Midcontinent/Rockies due to natural declines and Dolphin due to its production sharing contract, offset by increases in California, Argentina and Oman.
Commodity Price Sensitivity  Earnings
At current market prices, a $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 mm;
A swing of $0.50 per mmBTU in domestic gas prices has a $20 mm impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes;
While the current NYMEX gas price is around $3.70 per mmBTU, prices in California are about $3.50, in the Permian about $3.30, and the Rockies gas is in the $3.00 range.
We expect 3Q09 exploration expense to be about $50 mm for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings  3Q09 Outlook
For the Chemical segment, the second half of 2009 looks exceptionally weak.
The weakness in caustic soda is not being offset by chlorine price increases, resulting in declining margins;
The fourth quarter is traditionally the weakest for this business and we currently expect it to be about break even;
We expect 3Q09 Chemical earnings to fall at least 50% from 2Q09 levels.
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate for 3Q09 to be in the 40% to 42% range, depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings  California Exploration
Excluding the Kern County discovery:
Over the course of little over a year, we have drilled 34 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon bearing zones in California.
Of these wells, 9 are commercial and 16 are currently being evaluated;
We expect to drill an additional 8 exploration wells in 2009;
Oxy holds 1.1 mm acres of net fee minerals and leasehold in CA, which have been acquired in the last few years to exploit these opportunities. Discoveries similar to the Kern County discovery are possible in this net acre position.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings  California Exploration  Kern County Discovery
KERN COUNTY DISCOVERY AREA
Oxy believes there are between 150 mm and 250 mm gross barrels of oil equivalent reserves within the outlined area where we have drilled 6 wells to date.
Oxy's interest in the discovery area is approximately 80%.
Approximately two-thirds of the discovery is believed to be natural gas.
The discovery area's producing zones, whose areal geological extent is still being defined, consists of conventional oil and gas bearing formations.
It is probable that there are additional reserves outside the defined area.

Second Quarter 2009 Earnings  California Exploration  Kern County Discovery
In the Kern County discovery area:
We expect to drill an additional 17 wells during 2009;
The wells in this area cost about $3.5 to $4.0 million to drill and complete and have payout periods of less than six months;
The combined finding, development, and lifting costs are expected to be significantly less than $10 per boe;
We will also need to expand our 400 mmcf/d gas processing plant in Elk Hills to accommodate the expected production from the Kern County discovery;
There will be oil production from shale zones in this area.
