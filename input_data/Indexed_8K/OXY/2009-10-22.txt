Item 8.01.
 
Other Events
 
On October 22, 2009, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $927 million ($1.14 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $2.3 billion ($2.77 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2008.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $3.6 billion for the same period in 2008.  The decrease in the third quarter 2009 segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating expenses.
For the third quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 628,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 588,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2008.  Volumes increased by six percent domestically, mainly from California and the Permian and by 15 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely in Dolphin and Oman, partially offset by a six-percent decrease in Latin America mostly due to a labor strike in Argentina.   Increased California volumes resulted largely from the new exploration discoveries in Kern County.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $62.79 per barrel for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $104.15 per barrel for the third quarter of 2008.  Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.35 per MCF in the third quarter of 2008 to $3.04 per MCF for the third quarter of 2009.
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $72 million, compared with $219 million for the same period in 2008.  The third quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower margins for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride and lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and polyvinyl chloride.
 
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $66 million for the third quarter of 2008.  The third quarter of 2009 reflects better results in marketing operations, partially offset by lower margins in the gas processing business.
 
Net income for the nine months of 2009 was $2.0 billion ($2.43 per diluted share), compared with $6.4 billion ($7.77 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2008.
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $3.1 billion for the nine months of 2009, compared with $10.3 billion for the same period of 2008.  The decrease in segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating and administrative costs.
Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the first nine months was 643,000 BOE per day for 2009, compared with 594,000 BOE per day for the same 2008 period.  Volumes increased by five percent domestically mainly in California and Midcontinent/Rockies, by 14 percent in Latin America, and by 12 percent in the Middle East/North Africa largely due to Dolphin and Oman.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $51.44 per barrel for the nine months of 2009, compared with $100.39 per barrel for the nine months of 2008.  Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $9.18 per MCF in the nine months of 2008 to $3.15 per MCF in the nine months of 2009.
 
Chemical segment earnings were $356 million for the nine months of 2009, compared with $542 million for the nine months of 2008.  The 2009 results reflect lower volumes and prices for chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride due to the economic slowdown, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.
 
Midstream segment earnings were $154 million for the nine months of 2009, compared with $350 million for the same period in 2008.  The earnings decline in 2009 reflects lower margins in the gas processing business.
 
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "should," "expect," or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity price fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; exploration risks, such as drilling of unsuccessful wells; not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansions, field development, capital projects, acquisitions, or dispositions; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; operational interruptions and changes in tax rates.

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS
Occidental's results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core results," which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management's performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental's earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long term. Core results is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For Immediate Release: October 22, 2009
 
LOS ANGELES, October 22, 2009  Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income of $927 million ($1.14 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $2.3 billion ($2.77 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2008.
 
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Occidental achieved year-over-year production growth of nearly seven percent in the third quarter and eight percent in the nine months of 2009.  In addition, higher worldwide crude oil prices resulted in an increase in Occidental's third quarter of 2009 net income of 36-percent over the second quarter of 2009.
 
"Our Kern County discovery has made a significant contribution to this production growth.  Kern County gross production run rates grew from 7,700 BOE per day around the end of the first quarter, to 17,300 BOE per day at the end of the second quarter and to approximately 26,000 BOE per day at the end of the third quarter."
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $3.6 billion for the same period in 2008.  The decrease in the third quarter 2009 segment earnings reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes and lower operating expenses.
 
For the third quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 628,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 588,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2008.  Volumes increased by six percent domestically, mainly from California and the Permian and by 15 percent in the

Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $72 million, compared with $219 million for the same period in 2008.  The third quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower margins for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride and lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and polyvinyl chloride.
 
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared with $66 million for the third quarter of 2008.  The third quarter of 2009 reflects better results in marketing operations, partially offset by lower margins in the gas processing business.
 
Net income for the nine months of 2009 was $2.0 billion ($2.43 per diluted share), compared with $6.4 billion ($7.77 per diluted share) for the nine months of 2008.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Thank you, Chris, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.
 
This morning I will give you brief highlights of a few of the positive developments at Oxy during the last quarter. Steve Chazen will provide financial highlights and details shortly.
 
Our worldwide oil and gas production for the 2009 third quarter was nearly 7-percent higher than the third quarter last year. A significant portion of the domestic increase is from our new discovery in Kern County, California, which we announced last quarter. In the new discovery area, we currently have gross production of approximately 26,000 BOE per day, which is 8,700 BOE per day more than we reported to you last quarter. We continue to be excited about Oxy's growth potential in California.
 
I
n the third quarter we also achieved production growth in the Middle East region, mainly from our operations in Oman and the Dolphin Project. We continue to see opportunity in the Middle East, and it is a region in which we expect further growth.
In the next few weeks, we will launch a joint operating company to manage the development and production of the Bahrain Field. As you know, with Bahrain's national oil company and Mubadala of Abu Dhabi, we are teaming to dramatically increase the field's oil production
from 30,000 to over 100,000 barrels per day. Gas production is also expected to increase 50 percent to 2.5 BCF during the term of the contract. Oxy's net proved reserve additions over the life of the project are estimated to be 450 million BOE.
 
And, as announced last week, Oxy is part of an Eni-led consortium that has been awarded the license for development of the giant Zubair oil field in Iraq. Iraq holds the world's second-largest reserves of oil with about 115 billion barrels  second only to Saudi Arabia. Iraqi officials have said that they plan to increase the country's oil production from the current level of approximately 2.2 million barrels a day to as much as 12 million BOPD. We are now one of the few companies on the ground floor of this world-class opportunity.
 
The Zubair field has significant proved reserves estimated at more than 4.2 billion barrels and current production of 195,000 barrels of oil per day.
 
Development of Zubair will be a multi-year, multi-phased project with production expected to reach a plateau of more than a million barrels per day in the next six years. We expect Oxy's net share of peak production from the field to be approximately 90,000 barrels per day.
 
Zubair will give us the opportunity to learn  evaluating each phase of the project  and give us the insight to effectively evaluate future developments in Iraq.
 
We hope to expand our position and continue our involvement in Iraq while meeting our standards for security and rate of return.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to give you our third quarter and year-to-date financial results in greater detail.

Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Announcement
 
October 22, 2009
Los Angeles, California
 
Thank you Ray.
 
Net income was $927 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008.
 
Here's the segment breakdown for the .
third quarter
 
Oil and gas third quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.5 billion, compared to $3.6 billion for the third quarter of 2008.
 
                 
The $2.1 billion decrease in the third quarter of 2009 earnings was due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating expenses.  Occidental's average realized crude oil price in the 2009 third quarter was $62.79 per barrel, a decrease of 40 percent from the $104.15 per barrel in the comparable period of 2008.  Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $3.04 per mcf, compared with $9.35 per mcf for the third quarter of 2008.
 
 
                 
Worldwide oil and gas sales volumes for the third quarter of 2009 were 628,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of nearly seven percent, compared with 588,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of last year. 
The increase includes 22,000 BOE per day from domestic operations, 16,000 BOE per day from Oman and 10,000 BOE per day from Dolphin, partially offset by 8,000 BOE per day lower volumes from Argentina.
 
                 
The domestic volume increases occurred in California and the Permian.  The California production increase was largely a result of new wells from the Kern County discovery we announced last quarter.
 
                 
The Middle East included higher production in Oman and higher production sharing volumes compared to last year's third quarter.
 
                 
The Argentina decrease includes 9,000 BOE per day loss from a strike in Santa Cruz in the third quarter of 2009.
 
                 
Third quarter of 2009 worldwide oil and gas sales volumes decreased three percent or 21,000 BOE per day from the second quarter 2009 sales volumes of 649,000 BOE per day.
 
                 
Dolphin volumes were lower by 10,000 BOE per day resulting mainly from higher catch-up cost-recovery volumes in the second quarter.
 
                 
Argentina volumes decreased by 7,000 BOE per day due in large part to the Santa Cruz strike.
 
                 
Qatar and Libya volumes declined by 8,000 BOE per day due to the timing of liftings.
 
                 
Midcontinent/Rockies volumes were lower by 4,000 BOE per day which reflects the natural decline in gas production.
 
                 
California volumes increased by 8,000 BOE per day, largely the result of new wells from the Kern County discovery.
 
                 
Exploration expense was
$56 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance of $50 million.
 
Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.27 a barrel for the first nine months of 2009, a 15 percent decline from last year's twelve-month costs of $12.13 a barrel.  In the third quarter of 2009, Oil & Gas cash production costs were $10.15 per BOE, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2009 run rate.
 
Taxes  other than on income were $1.75 per barrel for the first nine months of 2009 compared to $2.62 per barrel for all of 2008.  These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in the first nine months of 2009.  In the third quarter of 2009 these taxes decreased to $1.73 per BOE, compared to the second quarter of 2009 rate of $1.82 per BOE, due to reductions in 2009  2010 property taxes.
 
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $72 million, compared to $219 million in last year's third quarter.  
The third quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors resulting in lower margins for caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride and lower volumes for chlorine, caustic soda, potassium hydroxide and polyvinyl chloride.
 
Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $77 million, compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2008.  The increase
 
in earnings was due to higher margins in the marketing business, partially offset by lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business.
 
The worldwide effective tax rate was 37 percent for the third quarter of 2009, compared with our guidance of 40 to 42 percent.  The decrease in rate reflects tax benefits resulting from the relinquishment of international exploration contracts and a higher proportion of expected total year domestic source pre-tax income.  Occidental generally records no tax benefit on foreign expensed exploration until the project is relinquished.
 
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the .
first nine months
 
Net income was $2.0 billion for the first nine months of 2009, compared with $6.4 billion for the first nine months of 2008.
 
Capital spending
for the third quarter of 2009 was $746 million and $2.6 billion for the first nine months.  We currently anticipate total year 2009 capital spending to be $3.7 billion.  The $100 million increase from our last estimate is allocated to domestic Oil & Gas operations.  Portions of the increase will be used to complete 130 previously drilled wells in the Piceance Basin.  This work will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and is expected to add about 40 MMCF per day to our production.
 
Cash flow from operations
for the nine months of 2009 was $3.8 billion.  We used $2.6 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $0.6 billion on acquisitions and foreign bonuses.  These items amounted to $3.2 billion of cash use.  We also used $794 million to pay dividends and in the third quarter we used $691 million to retire senior debt maturities, which was funded from the second quarter issuance of $750 million senior notes due in 2016.  These and other net cash outflows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $200
 
million to $1.6 billion at September 30.  Third quarter free cash flow after capital spending, dividends and taxes but before financing and acquisition activity was about $700 million.
 
As a result of the reduction in debt in the third quarter, our debt to capitalization ratio came down to 9 percent, which is the same level we reported last year-end.
 
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months were 811.1 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.9 million.
 
As we look ahead in the :
current quarter
 
                 
We expect oil and gas sales volumes to increase to about 650,000 to 660,000 BOE/day at about current oil prices.  The fourth quarter production is expected to reflect increases from California, Argentina and the Middle East / North Africa.
 
With regard to -
prices
 
                 
At current market prices, a $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million.  The average third quarter WTI oil price was $68.30 per barrel and NYMEX gas price was $3.60 per MCF.
 
                 
A swing of 50-cents per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $23 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.  The current NYMEX gas price is around $4.80 per MCF.

We expect exploration expense to be about $100 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.
 
                 
For the chemical segment, we expect continued weakness in the U.S. housing, automotive and durable goods sectors in the fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter is the weakest quarter for this business. Chemical earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be between $20 to $40 million as opposed to the break-even level we had estimated last quarter.  We expect increases in chlorine, caustic soda and polyvinyl chloride prices.  These increases are not expected to offset the higher feedstock and energy costs.
 
                 
We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 to be in the range of 40 to 42 percent depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income.  Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the "Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule."
 
                 
Acquisition Activity
 Last month we announced the acquisition of Phibro from Citigroup for a price that approximates the liquidation value of its assets.  As of the most recent information, the vast majority of Phibro's assets consist of cash and marketable securities.  The exact amount of the purchase price will be determined at closing which is expected this quarter.  We expect that our investment in Phibro will average about $250 million depending upon their cash needs from time to time.  They will operate as a stand alone entity while our current trading operations will continue selling our physical production. Our policies on hedging and risk management of our physical production remains unchanged.  Phibro has an extensive system of risk controls which will be overseen by Occidental employees.  The quality of Phibro's risk controls and management can be seen by their lack of any
 
losing years since 1997 when they were bought by Citi.  With time, we expect to use Phibro's excellent reputation in the Middle East and elsewhere to enhance our position in the region.
 
                 
Property acquisition activity has picked up recently.  We expect to close several hundred million dollars of property acquisitions in the fourth quarter.
 
                 
California Exploration
 Excluding the Kern County discovery discussed in last quarter's conference call, over the course of little over a year, we have drilled 36 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon bearing zones in California.  Of these wells, 11 are commercial and 10 are currently being evaluated.  We expect to drill an additional 7 exploration wells in 2009.  Occidental holds 1.1 million acres of net fee minerals and leasehold in California, which have been acquired in the last few years to exploit these opportunities.  Discoveries similar to the Kern County discovery are possible in this net acre position.  Additionally, we continue to pursue shale production which is expected to produce oil on this acreage.
 
                 
The Kern County discovery, which is near Elk Hills, is not below any producing zones.  In this area, we are currently producing from 10 wells approximately 105 million cubic feet of gas and 8,500 barrels of liquids per day, which is 8,700 BOE per day higher production from what we disclosed last quarter.  Cumulative gross production since the start of production through the end of September 2009 has been 8.5 billion cubic feet of gas and 765,000 barrels of liquids.  All of this production comes from conventional zones.  While there is oil production from shale zones in this area,
 
the bulk of the future production will come from conventional wells.  During 2009, we expect to drill an additional 11 wells.  In the next two quarters, the focus of our drilling will be on oil wells as we seek to further define the oil zone.

Exhibit 99.4
 

Exhibit 99.5
Statements in this release that contain words such as "will," "expect" or "estimate," or otherwise relate to the future, are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity price fluctuations and supply/demand considerations for oil, gas and chemicals; not successfully completing (or any material delay in) any expansions, field development, capital projects, acquisitions, or dispositions; higher-than-expected costs; political risk; operational interruptions; changes in tax rates and exploration risks, such as drilling of unsuccessful wells. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this release. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and natural gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use certain terms in this presentation, such as estimated proved reserves, probable, possible and recoverable reserves and oil in place, that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from using in filings with the SEC.  Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. U.S. investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosures in our Form 10-K, available through the following toll-free telephone number, 1-888-OXYPETE (1-888-699-7383) or on the Internet at http://www.oxy.com.
