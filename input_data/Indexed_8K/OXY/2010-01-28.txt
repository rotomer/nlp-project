Item 8.01.
Other Events
On January 28, 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $938 million ($1.15 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $443 million ($0.55 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Core results for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.1 billion ($1.30 per diluted share), compared with $957 million ($1.18 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Core results excluded after-tax charges of $120 million ($0.15 per diluted share) for 2009 and $514 million ($0.63 per diluted share) for 2008.
Net income for the twelve months of 2009 was $2.9 billion ($3.58 per diluted share), compared with $6.9 billion ($8.34 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2008.  Full year core results were $3.1 billion ($3.78 per diluted share) for 2009, compared with $7.3 billion ($8.94 per diluted share) for 2008.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $339 million for the same period in 2008.  The fourth quarter of 2009 core results were $1.8 billion, excluding a pre-tax loss of $170 million related to impairment of assets.  The 2008 core results were $1 billion, excluding pre-tax losses of $657 million relating to the impairment of assets and other items.  The $800 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 core results was primarily due to higher crude oil prices and sales volumes and lower operating costs.
For the fourth quarter of 2009, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 620,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2008, a year-over-year increase of nearly five percent.  Volumes increased by 14 percent in the Middle East/North Africa, and two percent each in the United States and Latin America.  The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from the Bahrain start-up and increased production from the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $69.39 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $53.52 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Domestic realized gas prices dropped from $4.67 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of 2009.

Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $33 million, compared with $127 million for the same period in 2008.  The fourth quarter of 2008 core results were $217 million after excluding a $90 million pre-tax loss related to plant closure and impairments.  The fourth quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in most domestic markets, but in particular U.S. housing, durable goods and agricultural sectors.
Midstream segment earnings were $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $170 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect lower margins in the marketing business in 2009, compared to 2008, partially offset by higher pipeline income from Dolphin and improved margins in the gas processing business.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $4.7 billion for the twelve months of 2009, compared with $10.7 billion for the same period of 2008.  Oil and gas core results, after excluding impairments and rig termination costs, were $4.9 billion for the twelve months of 2009, compared to $11.3 billion for the twelve months of 2008.  The $6.4 billion decrease in the 2009 core results reflected lower crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased oil and gas production and lower operating costs.
Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the year were 645,000 BOE per day for 2009, compared with 601,000 BOE per day for the 2008 period, a year-over-year increase of seven percent.  Volumes increased 4 percent domestically, mainly in California and Midcontinent Gas, by 10 percent in Latin America, and 13 percent in the Middle East/North Africa. The increase in the Middle East/North Africa resulted from higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman and higher volumes resulting from lower year-over-year average oil prices affecting our production sharing contracts.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $55.97 per barrel for the twelve months of 2009, compared with $88.26 per barrel for the twelve months of 2008.  Domestic realized gas prices decreased from $8.03 per MCF in the twelve months of 2008 to $3.46 per MCF in the twelve months of 2009.
Chemical segment earnings were $389 million for the twelve months of 2009 compared with $669 million for the twelve months of 2008.  The 2008 core results were $759 million after excluding charges for plant closure and impairments.  The decrease in 2009 results reflects lower volumes and prices for chlorine, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride, and vinyl chloride monomer due to the economic slow down, partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $235 million for the twelve months of 2009, compared with $520 million for the same period in 2008.  The 2009 results reflect lower marketing income and lower margins in the gas processing business.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: January 28, 2010
 
 
LOS ANGELES, January 28, 2010 -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced net income of $938 million ($1.15 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $443 million ($0.55 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Core results for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.1 billion ($1.30 per diluted share), compared with $957 million ($1.18 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Core results excluded after-tax charges of $120 million ($0.15 per diluted share) for 2009 and $514 million ($0.63 per diluted share) for 2008.
Net income for the twelve months of 2009 was $2.9 billion ($3.58 per diluted share), compared with $6.9 billion ($8.34 per diluted share) for the twelve months of 2008.  Full year core results were $3.1 billion ($3.78 per diluted share) for 2009, compared with $7.3 billion ($8.94 per diluted share) for 2008.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am pleased to announce Occidental's production for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was 645,000 BOE per day, the highest annual volume in the Company's history.  Occidental achieved year-over-year growth of over seven percent for the twelve months of 2009.  We expect the 2010 production to increase by 5 percent to 8 percent.
"The year 2009 experienced volatile commodity prices with WTI beginning the year in the low $40 per barrel range and ending the year above $75 per barrel.  Occidental reacted to the lower prices by reducing costs in key areas and managing our capital program.  We successfully reduced our oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, by 15 percent. "
 
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $339 million for the same period in 2008.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you, Chris. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
2009 was an interesting year that tested strategic and execution capabilities across the U.S. oil and gas industry. We believe that Oxy passed last years test with an A+. We achieved solid financial results in a challenging environment.
In a few minutes, Steve Chazen will provide details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. But first, I want to mention some highlights and key developments of the past year that we believe are integral to Oxys continued success in 2010 and beyond.
Notably, in 2009 we were able to grow our worldwide production 7-percent year-over-year while not increasing our net debt to capitalization ratio. This brought us to the highest annual production volume in our history  645,000 BOE per day. We expect a similar increase in oil and gas production both this year and next while continuing to focus on operational efficiency.
Also noteworthy, during the next two weeks we will be announcing the official results of our 2009 production replacement. The results look very favorable. We expect to announce that the 2009 reserve replacement ratio is about 200 percent.
In 2009 we maintained our A debt rating across all ratings agencies. And we continued to build our pipeline of exciting opportunities, which gives
 
 
 
 
us confidence that our production increases from continuing operations of about 5 to 8 percent annually over the last five years will again be an achievable target for the next five years.
These results are attributable to consistent execution of our long-term financial strategy, as well as a successful companywide initiative to reduce costs.
We aggressively managed our oil and gas production costs in 2009s volatile commodity price environment, reducing our oil and gas production costs per BOE by 15 percent, excluding production and property taxes. We ended the year with cash on hand of $1.2 billion, very little debt and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.
During the past 12 months, we capitalized on some key opportunities to strengthen our position and achieve further growth.
In the United States, we announced a significant discovery of oil and gas reserves in Kern County, California, with initial estimated reserves of 150 to 250 million gross barrels of oil equivalent. Steve will give you an update on its continued production growth in his upcoming comments.
We also made numerous acquisitions of properties adjacent to our key operations in Texas and California, and expanded other areas of our core business.
In our chemical segment, we acquired Dow Chemical Companys calcium chloride operations. Calcium chloride is a premium salt with a variety of beneficial applications, including ice control on roads and sidewalks. Our product line has an approximately 65 percent share of the North American calcium chloride market.
There were also significant, positive developments in the Middle East.
In Bahrain, we are partnering with Mubadala of Abu Dhabi on a project to redevelop the Bahrain Field. Field operations began on December 1. We
st
 
2
 
 
expect to increase oil production from the Bahrain Field to about three times its current level of production, to reach 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day within seven years, and increase gas production by more than 65 percent to approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet per day.
It was announced in the fourth quarter that Oxy, partnering with a consortium led by Eni, was awarded a license for development of the Zubair Field in Iraq. Last Friday we announced the signing of the contract with the government of Iraq. We expect Zubair to reach production of approximately 1.2 million barrels of oil per day within the next six years.
Solid production growth continued at the giant Mukhaizna oilfield in south-central Oman, where we have a major steam flood project for enhanced oil recovery. As of year-end 2009, gross daily production was over 10 times higher than the production rate in September 2005, when Oxy assumed operation of the field.
Looking ahead to our 2010 capital expenditures, we plan to increase CAPEX approximately 19 percent from the $3.6 billion spent in 2009 to about $4.3 billion, for projects that will stimulate our continued growth while maintaining our targeted financial returns.
Our 2009 results confirm that Oxy is well positioned to succeed in the volatile business climate that has presented significant challenges to our industry and to the global economy. We plan to maintain a low-risk, low-leverage profile and a consistent focus on building stockholder value.
With our concentration on core areas, growth in production and reserves, efficient operations and strong balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving sustained growth and delivering solid profitability.
Ill now turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

Thank you Ray.
Net income was $938 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $443 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The 2009 fourth quarter net income included after-tax non-core charges, mostly consisting of a $115 million impairment of certain Argentine producing properties.  The 2008 fourth quarter included after-tax non-core charges of $514 million for impairments, rig termination costs and plant closures.  Core results were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $957 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Heres the segment breakdown for the .
fourth quarter
Oil and gas fourth quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.6 billion, compared to $339 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Oil and gas core results for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.8 billion compared to $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, after excluding asset impairments in both periods and rig termination costs in 2008.

Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $33 million, compared to $127 million in last year's fourth quarter.  After excluding plant closure and impairments, the fourth quarter 2008 core results were $217 million.  The fourth quarter 2009 results reflect the continued weakness in most domestic markets, but in particular U.S. housing, durable goods and agricultural sectors.
Midstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $81 million, compared to $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The decrease in earnings was due to lower margins in the marketing business in 2009 compared to 2008, partially offset by improved NGL margins resulting from lower maintenance expenses, energy costs and property taxes in the gas processing business and higher income from the Dolphin Pipeline.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, in line with our guidance.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the .
twelve months
Net income was $2.9 billion for the twelve months of 2009, compared with $6.9 billion for the same period of 2008.  Core results for the twelve months of 2009 were $3.1 billion, compared with $7.3 billion for the full year of 2008.  Income for the twelve months of 2009 included $168 million of charges, net of tax and 2008 included $491 million of charges, net of tax, for the items noted on the schedule reconciling net income to core results.
Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.37 a barrel for the twelve months of 2009, a 15 percent decline from last year's twelve-month costs of $12.13 a barrel.
Taxes  other than on income were $1.77 per barrel for the twelve months of 2009 compared to $2.62 per barrel for all of 2008.  These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in 2009.
 
6
 
 
for 2009 was $3.6 billion.  Capital expenditures by segment were 79 percent in Oil and Gas, 6 percent in Chemical and 15 percent in Midstream.  The Oil and Gas expenditures were 56 percent in foreign operations and 44 percent domestically.
Capital spending
for the twelve months of 2009 was $5.8 billion.  We used $3.6 billion of the companys cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.8 billion on acquisitions and foreign bonuses.  These items amounted to $5.4 billion of cash use.  We also used $1.1 billion to pay dividends.  These and other net cash flows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $600 million to $1.2 billion at December 31.  Fourth quarter free cash flow after capital spending, dividends and taxes but before acquisition activity was about $850 million.
Cash flow from operations
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months were 811.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 9 percent.  Oxy's 2009 return on equity was 10.3 percent, with return on capital employed of 9.6 percent.
Now we'll discuss some factors affecting our
2010 program.
Beginning in 2010, we are making three reporting changes which will impact comparability between years.
