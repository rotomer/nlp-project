Item 5.02.
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 28 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) entered into a new employment agreement with Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Financial Officer, replacing his prior agreement which had expired.  The new agreement is for a term expiring in January 2015, and provides for an annual salary of not less than $720,000.  In addition, the agreement provides that Mr. Chazen will be eligible to participate in all benefit programs as are generally applicable to all employees and senior executives during the term of the agreement.
If he has satisfied the age and service requirements for retiree medical benefits under the terms of the current Occidental Medical Plan (the Eligibility Requirement), Mr. Chazen may retire at any time upon 90 days prior written notice. Any long-term, performance-based incentive award or portion thereof will vest to the extent provided by the applicable award agreement and any payment with respect thereto shall be made at the time and in the matter provided in the award agreement with respect to retirement with the consent of Occidental.  With respect to the non-vested portion of any such award, promptly in connection with his retirement, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee will consider whether to provide for future cash payments equal to what Mr. Chazen would have received had he continued to be an employee throughout the applicable performance period.
Occidental may discharge Mr. Chazen and terminate the agreement for material cause without severance or other pay upon 30 days written notice.  If Mr. Chazen's employment is terminated as a result of incapacity and he has satisfied the Eligibility Requirement, then Mr. Chazen shall have been deemed to have retired with the consent of Occidental.
Occidental may terminate Mr. Chazens employment at any time without cause or designate a termination with cause as a termination without cause, and in such case, if he has satisfied the Eligibility Requirement, Mr. Chazen will be deemed to have retired with the consent of Occidental.  In lieu of continued employment, Mr. Chazen will receive an amount equal to twice the sum of his highest base salary payable over a two-year compensation period.  During the compensation period, Mr. Chazen will continue to be eligible to exercise options and stock appreciation rights previously granted him that are or become exercisable.  In addition, Mr. Chazen will receive cash payments in the same manner and in the same amounts as if he continued as a full-time employee with respect to any performance-based long-term incentive award or portion thereof that does not vest as a result of Mr. Chazens retirement at the request of Occidental.  Mr. Chazen will also receive payments in lieu of the amounts that would have accrued during the compensation period under the Occidental Savings Plan, Occidental Retirement Plan and Occidental Supplemental Retirement Plan II or any successor plans.

WHEREAS, Employee, since May 1, 1994, has served as an officer of Employer, most recently pursuant to an agreement between Employee and Employer dated as of October 9, 2008, which expired January 12, 2010 (the Prior Agreement); and
WHEREAS, the parties desire to continue the employment relationship.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein, Employer and Employee hereby agree to continue Employees employment upon the following terms and conditions:
1.           .  Employee shall perform the duties of President and Chief Financial Officer or shall serve in such other capacity and with such other duties for Employer as the Chief Executive Officer of Employer may direct. In performing such duties, Employee will comply with Employers Code of Business Conduct and Corporate Policies, as the same may be amended from time to time.
Duties
2.           .  The term of employment shall be for a period of five (5) years, commencing as of the date hereof and ending midnight January 27, 2015, unless terminated prior thereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or unless extended by mutual agreement in accordance with Paragraph 8 hereof.
Term of Employment
3.           .  For the services to be performed hereunder, Employee shall be compensated by Employer at the base pay rate of not less than seven hundred twenty thousand dollars ($720,000) per annum, payable semi-monthly.  The minimum salary hereunder shall be automatically adjusted to the level of any increase in annual compensation as the Employer may determine during the term of this Agreement.

6.           .
Termination
(a)           .  If Employee has satisfied the age and service requirements to be eligible for retiree medical benefits under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Medical Care Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement, Employee may voluntarily retire, and such retirement shall be deemed to be retirement with the consent of Employer and not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement, so long as Employer is provided at least ninety (90) days notice of any retirement.
Retirement with the Consent of Employer
Any performance-based long-term incentive award or portion of such an award that has vested based on the terms of the award at the time of Employees termination of employment pursuant to this Paragraph 6(a) shall be paid at the time and in the manner provided for under the terms of such award.  In addition, promptly in connection with Employees retirement, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of Employers Board of Directors, as the Administrator of Long-Term Incentive Plans, shall consider whether to approve cash payments to Employee with respect to the portion of such awards that has not vested based on the terms of the award at the time of Employees termination.  Payment with respect to such awards, if any, shall be equal in value to the amounts Employee would have received with respect to such awards, and shall be made at the time such awards would have been settled, had Employee remained employed by Employer.  If the Committee decides not to approve a cash payment with respect to the non-vested awards, the Committee shall promptly provide to the Employee, in writing, the reasons for its decision.  Any dispute over such payment will be resolved by arbitration as provided in Paragraph 13.
(b)             Notwithstanding the term of this Agreement, Employer may discharge Employee and terminate this Agreement without severance or other pay upon thirty (30) days written notice or pay in lieu of such notice for material cause, including without limitation, (i) breach of any legal duty to Employer, or (ii) conduct constituting moral turpitude or conviction of a crime which may diminish Employees ability to effectively act on the Employers behalf or with or on behalf of others.  Employer shall give Employee notice of such cause and Employee shall have thirty (30) days to cure such breach.
Cause.
(c)           .  If, during the term of this Agreement, Employee is incapacitated from performing the essential functions of his job pursuant to this Agreement by reason of illness, injury, or disability, Employer may terminate this Agreement by at least one weeks written notice to Employee, but only in the event that such conditions shall aggregate not less than one-hundred eighty (180) days during any twelve (12) month period. If at the time notice is given, Employee has satisfied the age and service requirements to be eligible for retiree medical benefits under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Medical Care Plan in effect on the
Incapacity

date of this Agreement, then the Employee will be deemed to have retired with the consent of Employer.
(d)             Employer may at any time terminate the employment of Employee without cause or designate a termination for cause as a termination without cause, and in such event, if Employee has satisfied the age and service requirements to be eligible for retiree medical benefits under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Medical Care Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement, the Employee will be deemed to have retired with the consent of the employer.  Employer shall, in lieu of continued employment, compensate Employee in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of Employees highest annual base salary.  Such amount shall be payable in equal semi-monthly installments (less appropriate deductions for applicable taxes and the cost of any medical or dental coverage) over two (2) years, beginning with the first pay period following the date of Employees termination (the Compensation Period).
Retirement at the Request of Employer.
In the event Employee dies during the Compensation Period, any remaining installment payments due will be paid in a lump sum to Employees estate.  Such amount shall be paid as soon as administratively feasible and in no event later than 90 days following the date of Employees death.
In addition, Employee shall be entitled to the following:
(i)           During the Compensation Period, in addition to any right to additional or accelerated vesting under the terms of the applicable awards or Long-Term Incentive Plan, Employee shall continue to vest in all stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units (other than performance-based awards described in the following paragraph) previously granted to Employee under the Long-Term Incentive Plans, as if Employee had continued as a full-time employee of Employer.  Employee shall continue to be eligible to exercise all stock options and stock appreciation rights that are or become exercisable during the Compensation Period, provided that no such awards may be exercised after the earlier of (I) the latest date on which the award could have expired pursuant to its terms and (II) ten (10) years after its original grant date.
(ii)           Any performance-based long-term incentive award or portion of such an award previously granted to Employee under the Long-Term Incentive Plans that has vested at the time of Employees termination of employment pursuant to the terms of the award shall be paid at the time and in the manner provided for under the terms of such award.  In addition, Employee shall receive cash payments with respect to the non-vested portion of any such awards, based on Employers actual achievement with respect to the applicable performance-based vesting criteria.  Payments with respect to non-vested awards shall be equal in value to the amounts Employee would have received with respect to such awards had he not been requested to retire, and shall be made at the time such awards would have been settled, had Employee remained employed by Employer.
(iii)           During the Compensation Period, Employee shall be entitled to continued coverage (at Employers cost) under any general liability insurance policy maintained
 
 
- 3 - -
 
 
by Employer for the benefit of Employee at the time of Employees termination of employment on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to senior executives of Employer generally.
(iv)           During the Compensation Period, Employee and his spouse shall continue to be eligible to participate in Employers dental plan, as in effect from time to time, at the active participant rate, but on an after-tax basis.
(v)           Within 90 days following the end of each Payout Period (as defined below), Employee shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the aggregate employer-provided benefit Employee would have accrued during such Payout Period under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Savings Plan (the Savings Plan), the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Retirement Plan and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II (or any successor plan to any of the foregoing) assuming (I) Employee contributed the maximum elective contributions permissible under the Savings Plan and (II) a rate of compensation equal to the cash severance paid to Employee during such Payout Period pursuant to this Paragraph 6(d).  In addition, within 90 days following the end of each Payout Period, Employee shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the value (as determined in good faith by Employer) of continued participation during such Payout Period in any employee benefit plans in which Employee is participating at the time of his termination not otherwise described above in this Paragraph 6(d) (but only to the extent such plans continue to be available to salaried employees and senior executives during such Payout Period), which payment shall be in lieu of such continued participation.
For purposes of this Paragraph 6(d)(v), a Payout Period shall mean the portion of each calendar year beginning or ending within the Compensation Period that falls within the Compensation Period.  Each Payout Period shall end on December 31 of the calendar year, except that if the Compensation Period ends during a calendar year, the final Payout Period shall end on the last day of the Compensation Period.
(e)             Except as expressly provided above or under the terms of any plan, program, arrangement or agreement covering Employee, following Employees termination of employment, Employee shall not be entitled to participate in any employee benefit plans or programs offered by Employer.
No Other Benefits.
(f)             For purposes of this Agreement, the date of Employees termination of employment or retirement shall be the date of Employees separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A (Section 409A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(i) (or successor provisions) and, for purposes of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean separation from service.  For this purpose, Employee shall have a separation from service if he ceases to be an employee of Employer and all affiliates with whom Employer would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code.  In addition, for this purpose, Employee shall have a separation from service if it is reasonably anticipated that no further services shall be performed by Employee, or that the level of services Employee shall perform shall permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent of the average level of services performed by Employee over the immediately preceding 36-month period.

In recognition of the fact that differences may arise between the Employer and the Employee arising out of or relating to certain aspects of the Employee's employment with the Employer or the termination of that employment, and in recognition of the fact that resolution of any differences in the courts is rarely timely or cost-effective for either party, the Employer and Employee have agreed to the incorporation of the Provisions into the Agreement in order to establish and gain the benefits of a speedy, impartial and cost-effective dispute resolution procedure. By so doing, the Employer and the Employee mutually agree to arbitrate Claims (as defined below) and each knowingly and voluntarily waive their rights before a jury. Each party's promise to resolve Claims (as defined below) by arbitration in accordance with these Provisions is consideration for the other party's like promise, in addition to any other consideration.
1.           
Claims
1.1           Except as provided in paragraph 1.2 below, "Claims" (collectively called "Claim" or "Claims" in these Provisions) means all claims or controversies between the Employer and Employee or between the Employee and others arising out of, or relating to or concerning the Employee's employment with the Employer or termination thereof for which a state or federal court otherwise would be authorized to grant relief, including, but not limited to, claims based on any purported breach of contract, tort, state or federal statute or ordinance, common law, constitution or public policy, claims for wages or other compensation, or of discrimination, or violation of public policy of any type. Claims expressly include the Employee's Claims against the Employer, and any subsidiary and related or affiliated entity, successor or assign, and any of their officers, directors, employees, managers, representatives, attorneys or agents, and Claims against others arising out of, relating to or concerning the Employee's employment with the Employer or termination thereof.
1.2           These Provisions do not apply to or cover: claims for workers' compensation benefits, claims for unemployment compensation benefits, or claims for which the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction; claims by the Employer for injunctive and/or other equitable relief for intellectual property, unfair competition and/or the use and/or unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information; and claims based upon an employee pension or benefit plan the terms of which contain an arbitration or other non judicial resolution procedure, in which case the provisions of such plan shall apply. Employee shall further retain the right to seek injunctive and/or other equitable relief expressly made available by a statute which forms the basis of a Claim which is subject to arbitration under these Provisions. Where one or more of the included Claims in a dispute are covered under these Provisions and one or more of the included Claims in the dispute are not covered under these
 
 
A-1
 
 
Provisions, such covered and non-covered claims shall be separated and shall be heard separately in the appropriate forum for each claim.
2.           
Agreement to Arbitrate All Claims
2.1           Except for claims excluded from these Provisions by paragraph 1.2 above and as otherwise provided in paragraph 1.2 and 4.1, the Employer and the Employee hereby agree to the resolution by exclusive, final and binding arbitration of all Claims.
2.2           The parties further agree that any issue or dispute concerning the formation, applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of these Provisions, including any claim or contention that all or any part of these Provisions is void or voidable, shall be subject to arbitration as provided herein. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have authority to decide any such issue or dispute.
3.           
Governing Law
3.1           Except as modified by these Provisions, the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the rules set forth in the California Arbitration Act, California Civil Code or Procedure Section 1281, et. seq.
3.2           The Arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the State of California, or federal law, or both, as applicable to the Claims asserted.
4.           
Binding Effect
4.1           The arbitration Award (see Section 10, herein) shall be final and binding on the parties except that both parties shall have the right to appeal to the appropriate court any errors of law in the decision rendered by the Arbitrator.
4.2           The Award may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall serve as a bar to any court action for any Claim or allegation which was, or could have been, raised in Arbitration.
4.3           For Claims covered by these Provisions, Arbitration is the exclusive remedy, except as provided by paragraph 1.2. The parties shall be precluded from bringing or raising in court or before any other forum any dispute which could have been brought or raised pursuant to Arbitration.
4.4           Nothing in these Provisions shall prevent a party from pursuing any legal right to bring an action to vacate or enforce an Award or to compel arbitration pursuant to applicable California law.
 
 
A-2
 
 
5.           
Initiating Arbitration
To initiate the arbitration process, the aggrieved party must provide the other party or parties with: a written request to arbitrate any covered Claims which states the Claim or Claims for which arbitration is sought. The written request to arbitrate must be received within the limitations periods applicable under the law to such Claims.
6.           
Selection of the Arbitrator
6.1           All Claims shall be decided by a single neutral decision-maker, called the "Arbitrator."
6.2           To be qualified to serve, the Arbitrator must be an attorney in good standing with at least seven years experience in employment law or a retired judge and be available to hear the matter within sixty (60) days of selection and on consecutive days.
6.3           Within fifteen calendar days after receipt of the written request to arbitrate, the parties will attempt to agree on the selection of a qualified Arbitrator pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above. If the parties fail to agree on the selection of an Arbitrator within that fifteen calendar day period, the Employer will designate an alternate dispute resolution service (by way of example, American Arbitration Association, National Arbitration Forum, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services/Endispute) which has the capacity of providing the parties with a list of potential qualified arbitrators. The parties shall request that designated alternate dispute resolution service to provide them with a list of nine persons who meet the requirements of paragraph 6.2 above. Each party shall rate the nine names by giving the most preferred arbitrator the number nine and using descending successive numbers to rate the remaining choices in descending order of that party's preference and returning the list to the alternate dispute resolution service for calculation. The arbitrator candidate with the highest combined rating will be the Arbitrator. The functions of the alternate dispute resolution service shall be strictly limited to providing the list of arbitrator candidates and tallying the respective parties' ratings of the candidates in accordance with this Section 6 and no rules of that service shall otherwise apply.
7.           
Arbitration Procedures:
7.1           All parties may be represented by counsel throughout the arbitration process, including without limitation, at the arbitration hearing.
7.2           The Arbitrator shall afford each party a full and fair opportunity to present relevant and material proof, to call and cross-examine witnesses, and to present its argument.
7.3           The Arbitrator shall not be bound by any formal rules of evidence with the exception of applicable law regarding the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, and any applicable state or federal law regarding confidentiality of documents and other information (including, without limitation, pursuant to rights of privacy).
 
 
A-3
 
 
7.4           The Arbitrator shall decide the relevance of any evidence offered, and the Arbitrator's decision on any question of evidence or argument shall be final and binding.
7.5           The Arbitrator may receive and consider the evidence of witnesses by affidavit and shall give it such weight as the Arbitrator deems appropriate after consideration of any objection made to its admission.
7.6           Either party, at its expense, may arrange and pay for the cost of a court reporter to provide a stenographic record of the proceedings. The other party may obtain a copy of the recording by paying the reporter's normal fee for such copy. If both parties agree to utilize the services of a court reporter, the parties shall share the expense equally and shall be billed and responsible for payment individually.
7.7           Either party shall have the right to file an pre- or post-hearing brief. The time for filing such briefs shall be set by the Arbitrator.
7.8           The Arbitrator has authority to entertain a written or oral motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment, dispositive of all or part of any Claim, to which the Arbitrator shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
