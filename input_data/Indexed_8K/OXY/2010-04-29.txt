Item 8.01.
Other Events
On January 28, 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion ($1.32 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $371 million ($0.45 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2009.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $545 million for the same period in 2009.  The increase in the first quarter of 2010 results was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes.
For the first quarter of 2010, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 726,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 713,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2009.  Volumes increased in the Middle East/North Africa and California and were partially offset by decreases in Latin America.  The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from the Bahrain start-up and increased production from the Mukhaizna field in Oman.  Latin America volumes dropped in Argentina due to a labor strike.  Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia due to higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts by 38,000 BOE per day.  Underlying daily production volumes were 743,00 0 BOE in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 711,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2009, largely reflecting the Bahrain production.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $71.88 per barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $39.29 per barrel for the first quarter of 2009.  Domestic realized gas prices rose from $3.54 per MCF in the first quarter of 2009 to $5.62 per MCF for the first quarter of 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million, compared with $169 million for the same period in 2009.  The first quarter 2010 results reflect the continued weakness in the domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into 2010.

Midstream, Marketing and Other
Midstream segment earnings were $94 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $14 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Earnings for the first quarter of 2010 reflect higher margins in the marketing and trading businesses, improved prices in the gas processing business, and higher pipeline income from Dolphin.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: April 29, 2010
 
LOS ANGELES, April 29, 2010 -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion ($1.32 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $371 million ($0.45 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2009.
In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We continue to see progressive growth in Occidentals quarterly net income into 2010.  The first quarter 2010 income from continuing operations of $1.1 billion was a 189-percent increase over the same period of 2009 and reflects strengthening of worldwide product prices and higher volumes.  The first quarter 2010 production was 743,000 BOE per day, a 4.5 percent-increase from the first quarter of 2009 despite losing 38,000 BOE per day from the effect of production sharing and similar contracts.  The first quarter 2010 results generated cash flow from operating activities of $2.2 billion.  Free cash flow after capital spending and dividends was $1.1 billion.
"We are looking forward to our May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City, where we will discuss exciting opportunities for Occidental's future growth."
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $545 million for the same period in 2009.  The increase in the first quarter of 2010 results was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes.
For the first quarter of 2010, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 726,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 713,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2009.  Volumes increased in the Middle East/North Africa and California and were partially

Thank you, Chris.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Steve Chazen will provide details on our financial results for the first quarter of 2010 in a moment.  But first, I want to give you a brief preview of our meeting with all of you in the financial analyst community in New York on May 19.
th
Both Steve and I will present at the meeting, as will our senior executives responsible for: international oil gas operations; U.S. oil and gas operations; California oil and gas operations; and worldwide exploration.
and
We will give you details on developments in numerous key areas of our operations which we know are of keen interest to you. Among the areas we will cover:

My colleagues and I look forward to meeting with you in three weeks to give you a thorough presentation on these and the numerous other outstanding growth areas at Oxy.
Ill now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our first quarter performance.

Thank you Ray.
Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.  The first quarter 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share.  The 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share.
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel, are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you.  See the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules for the previous 5-year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Heres the segment breakdown for the .
first quarter
Oil and gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion, compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009.  The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 83 percent in 2010 and
 
3
 
 
domestic natural gas prices improved 59 percent from the first quarter of 2009.  Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO costs in 2010, higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange.  Year-over-year production was negatively impacted by 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, as a result of higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.

Oil and gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion, was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009.

5
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million, compared with $33 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.  The first quarter 2010 results reflect the continued weakness in the domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into the first quarter of 2010.
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million, compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the marketing and trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulting from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance.  Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent for the first quarter of 2010.
for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million.  Capital expenditures by segment were 80 percent in Oil and Gas, 15 percent in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals.  The spending run rate will increase through the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq.  Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Capital spending
for the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion.  We used $850 million of the companys cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments.  These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use.  We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter.  We
Cash flow from operations

also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt.  These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at March 31.  First quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the three months of 2010 were 812.1 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the :
current quarter

We will provide additional details at the May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City.  We request that you limit your questions today specifically to the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain, and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting.
