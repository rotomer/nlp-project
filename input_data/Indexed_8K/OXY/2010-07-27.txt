Item 8.01.
Other Events
On July 27, 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.1 billion ($1.31 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $682 million ($0.84 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2009.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.9 billion for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $1.1 billion for the same period in 2009. The increase in the second quarter of 2010 results was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes.
For the second quarter of 2010, daily oil and gas sales volumes averaged 747,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 719,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2009. Volumes increased in the Middle East/North Africa and California and were partially offset by decreases in Colombia. The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from the Bahrain start-up and increased production from the Mukhaizna field in Oman. Underlying daily production volumes were 743,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 717,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of over three and one-half percent. Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia due to higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts by a tot al of 29,000 BOE per day.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $72.13 per barrel for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $52.97 per barrel for the second quarter of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices rose from $2.87 per MCF in the second quarter of 2009 to $4.19 per MCF for the second quarter of 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter 2010 were $108 million, compared with $115 million for the same period in 2009. The second quarter of 2010 results continue to reflect the significant caustic soda price erosion and higher raw material prices experienced in the second half of 2009 offset by improved volumes across most product lines.

Midstream segment earnings were $13 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared with $63 million for the second quarter of 2009. Earnings for the second quarter of 2010 reflect lower margins in the marketing and trading businesses, partially offset by higher margins in the gas processing business and pipelines businesses.
Net income for the first six months of 2010 was $2.1 billion ($2.61 per diluted share), compared with $1.1 billion ($1.29 per diluted share) for the same period in 2009. Year-to-date 2010 core results were $2.1 billion ($2.63 per diluted share), compared with $1.1 billion ($1.34 per diluted share).
Oil and gas segment earnings were $3.7 billion for the six months of 2010, compared with $1.6 billion for the same period of 2009. The $2.1 billion increase in the 2010 results reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes.
Daily oil and gas sales volumes for the six months were 737,000 BOE per day for 2010, compared with 716,000 BOE per day for the 2009 period. Volumes increased in the Middle East/North Africa, resulting from the new production in Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman, and domestically in California. Volumes declined in Latin America, mainly in Colombia. Underlying daily production volumes were 743,000 BOE in the first six months of 2010, compared with 713,000 BOE for 2009, an increase of over four percent. Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia resulting from higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts by 28,000 BOE per day.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $72.01 per barrel for the six months of 2010, compared with $46.05 per barrel for the six months of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $3.20 per MCF in the six months of 2009 to $4.90 per MCF in the six months of 2010.
Chemical segment earnings were $138 million for the six months of 2010, compared with $284 million for the same period in 2009.  The 2010 six-month results reflect the significant margin erosion in caustic soda, which began in 2009 due to the economic downturn, particularly in the housing and construction sectors, combined with higher raw material costs primarily for ethylene.  Volumes and prices across most product lines are gradually recovering, resulting in the improvement in earnings from first quarter $30 million to second quarter of $108 million.
Midstream segment earnings were $107 million for the six months of 2010, compared with $77 million for the same period in 2009.  The 2010 results reflect higher margins in the gas processing business and increased earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses, partially offset by lower marketing and trading income.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you Chris.
Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
second quarter.
Oil and gas second quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009.  The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices with additional contributions from higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 36 percent in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 46 percent from the second quarter of 2009.  Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO costs in 2010.

Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $108 million. The second quarter results reflect improvement from the first quarter 2010 in margins and volumes across most product lines.
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $13 million, compared to $63 million in the second quarter of 2009.  The decrease in earnings was mainly due to a pre-tax $104 million ($0.07 after-tax per diluted share) loss at Phibro, the bulk of which resulted from marking its quarter-end open positions to market.  This was partially offset by higher margins in the marketing, gas processing and pipeline businesses.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 43 percent for the second quarter of 2010.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during
the first six months.
Net income was $2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share for the first six months of 2010, compared with $1.1 billion or $1.29 per diluted share for the first six months of 2009.
for the second quarter of 2010 was about $865 million and $1.7 billion for the first six months.  Year to-date capital expenditures by segment were 81 percent in Oil and Gas, 13 percent in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals.  Our total year capital is expected to be about $4.5 billion.  The capital spending rate will increase in

the second half of the year largely resulting from Iraq, Bahrain and California.
for the six months of 2010 was $4.3 billion.  We used $1.7 billion of the companys cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $460 million on acquisitions and $300 million on foreign contracts.  These investing cash flow uses amounted to $2.5 billion.  We also used $540 million to pay dividends and $300 million to retire debt.  These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at June 30.  The first six months' free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $2.1 billion.
Cash flow from operations
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the six months of 2010 were 812.3 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.7 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 8 percent at the end of the second quarter.
