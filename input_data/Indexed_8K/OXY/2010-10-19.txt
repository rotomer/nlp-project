Other Events
 
On October 19, 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) announced income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.2 billion ($1.47 per diluted share), compared with $929 million ($1.14 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2009. Net income was $1.2 billion ($1.46 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $927 million ($1.14 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2009.
 
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $1.5 billion for the same period in 2009. The increase in the third quarter of 2010 results was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
 
< /div>
For the third quarter of 2010, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 751,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 705,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2009.
Volumes increased 6.5 percent, primarily in the Middle East/North Africa, with smaller increases in Argentina and the United States. The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from the Bahrain start-up and increased production from the Mukhaizna field in Oman. Daily sales volumes were 749,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 702,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2009.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $70.71 per barrel for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $62.79 per barrel for the third quarter of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices rose from $3.04 per MCF in the third quarter of 2009 to $4.20 per MCF for the third quarter of 2010.
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter 2010 were $189 million, compared with $72 million for the same period in 2009. The third quarter of 2010 results reflect improved margins and volumes across chlor-alkali and vinyl products. Export volumes also increased by 22 percent compared to 2009.
 
1
 
 
 
 
Midstream segment earnings were $163 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $77 million for the third quarter of 2009. Earnings for the third quarter of 2010 reflect higher margins in the trading and marketing businesses and higher pipeline income.
 
 
Year-to-date 2010 income from continuing operations was $3.3 billion ($4.09 per diluted share), compared with $2.0 billion ($2.44 per diluted share) for 2009. Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $3.3 billion ($4.07 per diluted share), compared with $2.0 billion ($2.43 per diluted share) for the same period in 2009.
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $5.4 billion for the nine months of 2010, compared with $3.1 billion for the same period of 2009. The $2.3 billion increase in the 2010 results reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
 
Daily oil and gas production volumes for the nine months were 746,000 BOE for 2010, compared with 711,000 BOE for the 2009 period, an increase of nearly 5 percent. Volumes increased in the Middle East/North Africa, resulting from the new production in Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman, and domestically in California.  Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia resulting from higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting production sharing and similar contracts by 21,000 BOE per day. Daily sales volumes were 741,000 BOE in the first nine months of 2010, compared with 711,000 BOE for 2009.
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $71.57 per barrel for the nine months of 2010, compared with $51.44 per barrel for the nine months of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $3.15 per MCF in the nine months of 2009 to $4.67 per MCF in the nine months of 2010.
 
 
Chemical segment earnings were $327 million for the nine months of 2010, compared with $356 million for the same period in 2009. The 2010 nine-month results reflect improving market conditions, with global markets outpacing domestic markets in the recovery resulting in 16 percent higher export volumes compared to 2009.
 
 
Midstream segment earnings were $270 million for the nine months of 2010, compared with $154 million for the same period in 2009. The 2010 results reflect higher margins in the gas processing business and increased earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses.

For Immediate Release: October 19, 2010
LOS ANGELES, October 19, 2010 -- Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) announced income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.2 billion ($1.47 per diluted share), compared with $929 million ($1.14 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2009.

In announcing the results, Dr. Ray R. Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The third quarter 2010 net income of $1.2 billion was 28 percent higher than the same period of 2009. Our oil & gas production of 751,000 BOE per day was the highest in Oxy's history and reflected our continuing growth representing a 6.5-percent increase over 2009.

Free cash flow after capital spending and dividends was $3.1 billion.
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $1.5 billion for the same period in 2009.

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
Thank you, Chris. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am very enthusiastic about the new management structure we announced last week, both for myself and for Oxy. The new structure will assure Oxy of continuity of a winning team, both in terms of our experienced and effective management, and in terms of our emphasis on a highly successful business strategy.
To recap the new structure, I informed our Board of Directors of my desire to relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer, effective at the May 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and to continue as full-time Executive Chairman. I recommended to the Board that Steve Chazen replace me as CEO. The Board agreed with this new structure. Steve is a proven leader. He has been an integral member of our senior management team for many years. Steve joined Occidental in 1994 as Executive Vice President  Corporate Development, became Chief Financial Officer in 1999, President in 2007, and Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. He was also elected to the Board of Directors in 2010. He has made and will continue to make significant contributions to Occidentals ongoing success and development. This is a carefully developed and long anticipated senior management transition.
 
 
 
 
Steve and I have had an extraordinarily productive partnership for many years. Clearly, maintaining this partnership is in the best interests of Oxy and its stockholders, and I look forward to continuing this partnership in future years.
During the 20 years that I have been CEO, our management team has transformed Oxy from a conglomerate of unrelated business entities with a market capitalization of $5 billion, into the fourth-largest oil and gas company in the United States with a market capitalization of almost $70 billion.  Oxy has led its proxy peer group in total stockholder return  with cumulative returns of 76 percent over the past three years, 204 percent over the past five years and 870 percent over the past 10 years. I am very proud of these accomplishments.
Our management team is strong and cohesive, and will be ready, willing and able under this new structure to take Oxy to new heights in performance and excellence.
Ill now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our third quarter performance.

Thank you Ray.
Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.  Income from continuing operations was $1.47 per diluted share in the third quarter this year, compared to $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
third quarter.
Oil and gas third quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.7 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2009.  The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices with additional contributions from higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 13 percent in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 38 percent from the third quarter of 2009.  Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO costs in 2010.

3
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $189 million, compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2010. The third quarter results reflect improvement from the second quarter 2010 in
 
4
 
 
both volumes and margins across most product lines.  Export markets have improved more rapidly than domestic markets due in part to the favorable feedstock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.
Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $163 million, compared to $77 million in the third quarter of 2009.  The increase in earnings was mainly due to trading and marketing income and higher margins in the pipeline businesses.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41 percent for the third quarter of 2010.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during
the first nine months.
Net income was $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010, compared with $2.0 billion or $2.43 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2009.  Core income was $3.3 billion or $4.09 per diluted share for the first nine months of this year, compared with $2.0 billion or $2.48 per diluted share for the year to date 2009 period.
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the nine months of 2010 were 812.4 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 7 percent at the end of the third quarter.
for the third quarter of 2010 was about $1.1 billion and $2.8 billion for the first nine months.  Year to-date capital expenditures by segment were 82 percent in Oil and Gas, 13 percent in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals.
Capital spending
for the nine months of 2010 was $6.6 billion.  We used $2.8 billion of the companys cash flow to fund capital

expenditures, $1.6 billion on acquisitions and $340 million on foreign contracts.  These investing cash flow uses amounted to $4.7 billion.  We also used $850 million to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt.  These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $0.9 billion to $2.1 billion at September 30.  The first nine months' free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $3.1 billion.
Acquisitions

Our total year is expected to be about $4.4 billion.  The capital spending rate will increase in the fourth quarter of the year largely in our domestic operations and in Iraq.
capital spending
 At the beginning of the year we were running 11 development rigs in California and 5 rigs in the Permian.  We are currently running 16 drilling rigs in California and 9 in the Permian and expect our year-end exit rate rig count to reach 19 rigs in California and 14 in the Permian.  Next year, we anticipate working 21 rigs in California and 15 rigs in the Permian.  In the current environment, we are cautious about natural gas drilling and may reevaluate our 2011 U.S. natural gas drilling program.
Drilling rigs
 In the Permian, we are currently running 94 workover rigs, compared with the 57 rigs we had at the beginning of the year.  We currently expect to be operating 110 rigs at the end of 2010.  A portion of workover expenditures are expensed as opposed to being capitalized depending on their nature.  Our operating costs have recently increased due to higher workover activity to $10.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 and further increases are expected in the fourth quarter.

Century Plant
The Century Plant has just started operations and will be providing additional CO to support growth in our Permian operations.  We expect that the plant will yield about 180 million cubic feet per day of CO next year to support our Permian EOR operations.  We are in the process of contracting additional CO from other sources and will use penalty payments due from the operator for under production to support these activities.  We expect to have sufficient COto meet the needs of our previousl y disclosed expansion of flooding activities.
