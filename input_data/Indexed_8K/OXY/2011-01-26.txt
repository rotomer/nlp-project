Item 8.01.
Other Events
 
On January 26, 2011, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.2 billion ($1.49 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $938 million ($1.15 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2009. Core income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1.3 billion ($1.58 per diluted share), compared with $1.1 billion ($1.35 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net income for the twelve months of 2010 was $4.5 billion ($5.56 per diluted share), compared with $2.9 billion ($3.58 per diluted share) for 2009. Full year 2010 core results were $4.7 billion ($5.72 per diluted share), compared with $3.2 billion ($3.92 per diluted share) for 2009.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 and included $275 million of domestic asset impairments. After excluding these asset impairments, oil and gas core results of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 were slightly higher than 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 results reflect higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, daily oil and gas production volumes, including Argentina, averaged 753,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2009. Volumes increased 5 percent, primarily in the Middle East/North Africa, with a smaller increase coming from Domestic gas production. The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from the Bahrain start-up and increased production from the Mukhaizna field in Oman. Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia resulting from higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting production sharing and similar contracts by 13,000 BOE per day. Daily sales volumes from continuing operations were 699,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 680,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $79.96 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $71.74 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices dropped from $4.37 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $4.13 per MCF for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter 2010 were $111 million, compared with $33 million for the same period in 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 results reflect improved margins and volumes across all products.
Midstream segment earnings were $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with $81 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflect higher margins in the trading and marketing businesses.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $7.2 billion for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $5.1 billion for the same period of 2009. Oil and gas core results, after excluding asset impairments and rig termination costs, were $7.4 billion for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $5.1 billion for the same period of 2009. The $2.3 billion increase in the 2010 results reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
Daily oil and gas production volumes for the twelve months, including Argentina,  were 748,000 BOE for 2010, compared with 712,000 BOE for the 2009 period, an increase of 5 percent. Volume increases in the Middle East/North Africa, resulting from the new production in Bahrain and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman, and gas production from the domestic assets were partially offset by a decline in Colombia. Production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia resulting from higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting production sharing and similar contracts by 16,000 BOE per day. Daily sales volumes, from continuing operations, were 701,000 BOE in the twelve months of 2010, compared with 672,000 BOE for 2009.
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $75.16 per barrel for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $57.31 per barrel for the twelve months of 2009. Domestic realized gas prices increased from $3.46 per MCF in the twelve months of 2009 to $4.53 per MCF in the twelve months of 2010.
Chemical segment earnings were $438 million for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $389 million for the same period in 2009. The 2010 twelve-month results reflect improved market conditions, particularly for exports, driven by favorable feedstock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.  Vinyls exports for 2010 were 125% higher compared to 2009.
Midstream segment earnings were $472 million for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $235 million for the same period in 2009. The 2010 results reflect higher margins in the marketing and trading businesses.

QUARTERLY RESULTS
 
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 and included $275 million of domestic asset impairments. After excluding these asset impairments, oil and gas core results of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 were slightly higher than 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 results reflect higher crude oil prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
Thank you, Chris. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
In a few minutes, Steve Chazen will provide details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010. But first, I want to mention some key developments of the last week and of the past quarter that we believe are significant to continuing Oxys success in 2011 and beyond.
Last week, we announced that the Government of Abu Dhabi selected Oxy to participate in the development of the Shah gas field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East. Oxy will hold a 40-percent participating interest in a 30-year contract with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company holding the remaining 60-percent.
We are honored that the Abu Dhabi government has chosen Oxy to participate with them in this major project. This is another important step in the implementation of our growth strategy in the Middle East and in our relationship with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
You will recall that in 2007 Oxy submitted a bid on the Shah project and was not selected. However, development of the field under the agreement in principle announced last week provides an exciting opportunity to create value for the people of Abu Dhabi and for Oxy stockholders. We
 
1
 
 
 
expect it to provide similar returns to Oxy as our traditional Middle East properties.
Working in close partnership with ADNOC, we will apply our expertise in this technically challenging project to develop high-sulfur content reservoirs within the Shah field. The project is anticipated to produce approximately 500 million cubic feet per day of sales gas  providing net to Oxy in the range of 200 million cubic feet per day. In addition, the project is expected to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day of condensate and natural gas liquids  which we expect to yield in the range of 20,000 barrels per day net to Oxy.
ADNOC is already in the process of developing the field and the majority of its engineering procurement and construction contracts have already been awarded. Production from the field is scheduled to begin in 2014.
Capital expenditures for the entire project are estimated to be in the range of $10 billion with Oxys share proportional to the ownership.
Another key development for Oxy  as we announced last month  was a strategic adjustment we have made to our asset base in order to improve the companys performance and profitability.
We are selling our oil and gas operations in Argentina  which have not performed to our expectations  to a subsidiary of Sinopec and expect after-tax proceeds to be approximately $2.5 billion.
We have made acquisitions in new producing areas for Oxy  North Dakota and South Texas  which we believe have solid potential for growth.
We expect the combination of these transactions to immediately improve our earnings, ROCE and free cash flow. The North Dakota
 
2
 
 
 
acquisition has already closed and we anticipate the Argentina and South Texas transactions to close by the end of this quarter.
Two years ago we went into North Dakota with a modest amount of acreage in the oil-rich Bakken and Three Forks formations of the Williston Basin. Now we have expanded our position in the area to over 200,000 acres by purchasing approximately 180,000 net contiguous acres from a private seller for about $1.4 billion.
We expect to grow our production in the Williston Basin from these properties to about 30,000 BOE per day over the next five years.
The South Texas acquisition from Shell  for about $1.8 billion  gives us properties which have over 320 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent in proven developed reserves and are liquid-rich with a solid inventory of drilling opportunities.
Oxy is already a major producer in Texas, and these South Texas assets further expand our footprint in the state.
We anticipate the new U.S. assets to immediately yield reasonable earnings and produce good free cash flow  even at current gas prices. As gas prices improve in the future and we optimize overall area opportunities, these properties will fit well with our overall presence, performance and continued growth in the U.S.
The U.S. acquisitions, together with those we made in the third quarter, will replace our production from Argentina with better profits, ROCE and free cash flow.
As evidence of our confidence in Oxys performance with the addition of our new U.S. assets, Oxys Board of Directors has announced its intention to increase our common share dividend rate by 21 percent, to an annual rate of $1.84, effective with the April 15 payment.
th
This will mark Oxys 10
th
 
3
 
 
 
dividend increase since 2002, bringing the compounded annual growth rate over the period to 15.6 percent.
In 2011 we will maintain our focus on delivering value to our stockholders and partners as we continue improving our asset base, while growing production and reserves.
Ill now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to report on Oxys financial performance during the past quarter and full year.

Thank you Ray.
Core income was $1.3 billion or $1.58 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.  Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $938 million or $1.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.  As required by accounting rules, Argentina has been classified as a discontinued operation.  Therefore, Argentina's results have been excluded from continuing operations, net of tax, for all periods.  Details of Argentina's operating results for years 2008, 2009 and by quarters in 2010 are included in the Investors Relations Supplemental Schedules.  Argentina has not been profitable for the last four years.  The 2010 fourth quarter also included after-tax non-core charges of $175 million for impairments predominately of gas properties in the Rockies and an $80 million benefit related to  foreign tax credit carry-forwards.
 
 
5
 
 
The fourth quarter 2010 core income included $110 million higher pre-tax expense compared to the third quarter ($70 million after-tax or $0.09 per diluted share) from equity and related compensation programs mostly due to the effect of the steep increase in the company's stock price during this period.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
fourth quarter.
Oil and gas segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $1.7 billion.  Realized crude oil prices increased 11  percent in 2010 but domestic natural gas prices declined 5  percent from the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
6
 
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $111 million and in line with our earlier guidance.
Midstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $202 million, compared to $163 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The increase in earnings was mainly due to higher trading and marketing income.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 38 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during
the twelve months.
Core income was $4.7 billion or $5.72 per diluted share for the twelve months of this year, compared with $3.2 billion or $3.92 per diluted share for the full year of 2009.  Net income was $4.5 billion or $5.56 per diluted share for the twelve months of 2010, compared with $2.9 billion or $3.58 per diluted share for the same period of 2009.  Income for the twelve months of 2010 included $134 million of charges, net of tax and 2009 included $277 million of charges, net of tax, for the items noted on the schedule reconciling net income to core results.
 
 
7
 
 
 
Oil and gas cash production costs, which exclude production and property taxes, were $10.19 a barrel for 2010, excluding Argentina.  Last year's twelve-month costs were $8.95 a barrel, on the same basis.  The year-over-year increase reflects $0.32 a barrel in higher CO costs, due to our decision toexpense 100% of injected CO beginning in 2010, and higher field support operations, workovers and maintenance costs.
2
 
2
Taxes  other than on income were $1.83 per barrel for 2010 compared to $1.67 per barrel for all of 2009.  These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and gas prices in 2010.
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was about $1.4 billion and $3.9 billion for the twelve months, excluding Argentina.  Capital expenditures by segment were 80 percent in Oil and Gas, 13 percent in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals.
Capital spending
for the twelve months of 2010 was $9.1 billion, excluding Argentina.  We used $3.9 billion of the companys cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $4.7 billion on acquisitions and $225 million on foreign contracts.  These investing cash flow uses amounted to $8.8 billion.  We issued $2.6 billion of senior debt in the fourth quarter.  We also used $1.2 billion to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt.  Argentina's net cash flow for the year was a negative $125 million, after spending $415 million for capital expenditures and contract extension payments.  These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion at December 31.  Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $4.3 billion.
Cash flow from operations
 
8
 
 
 
Acquisitions
On a preliminary basis, our 2010 reserve replacement ratio was about 150 percent.  Approximately one-third of the current year reserve adds came from acquisitions.  We will provide additional details regarding reserves as soon as the information is available.
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months of 2010 were 812.5 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 14 percent at the end of the year.  Oxy's 2010 return on equity was 14.7 percent, with return on capital employed of 13.2 percent.
