Section 8  Other Events
Item 8.01.  Other Events
On April 28, 2011, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced core income of $1.6 billion ($1.96 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2011, compared with $1.1 billion ($1.35 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2010.  Net income for the first quarter of 2011 was $1.5 billion ($1.90 per diluted share), compared with $1.1 billion ($1.31 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.5 billion for the first quarter of 2011, compared with $1.9 billion for the same period in 2010.  The increase in the first quarter of 2011 results was due to higher crude oil prices and higher sales volumes in the Middle East, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
For the first quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 730,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 701,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2010.  Volumes increased over 4 percent, primarily in domestic gas and NGL production and Middle East/North Africa crude oil volumes.  The domestic gas increase was from the new acquisition in South Texas, which closed in the first quarter of 2011.  The Middle East/North Africa increase included new production from Iraq and higher volumes from the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was negatively impacted in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia by 12,000 BOE per day.  Dolphin and Elk Hills volumes were also lower from planned maintenance and production shut-downs in the first quarter of 2011.
Daily sales volumes increased over 6 percent from 685,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2010 to 728,000 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2011.
 
 
 
 
Oxy's realized price for worldwide crude oil was $92.14 per barrel for the first quarter of 2011, compared with $74.09 per barrel for the first quarter of 2010.  Worldwide realized NGL prices rose from $47.48 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010 to $52.64 per barrel in the first quarter of 2011.  Domestic realized gas prices dropped from $5.62 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2010 to $4.21 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter 2011 were $219 million, compared with $30 million for the same period in 2010.  The first quarter of 2011 results reflect strong export sales, higher margins resulting from improved supply/demand balances across most products, including calcium chloride, and lower energy costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $114 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared with $94 million for the first quarter of 2010.  Earnings for the first quarter of 2011 reflect increased income from the pipeline business, higher margins in the marketing and trading business, partially offset by lower margins in the gas processing business.

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
Thank you Chris.
Core income was $1.6 billion or $1.96 per diluted share in the first quarter this year, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.35 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year.  Non-core items amounted to a net after-tax charge of $44 million.  Non-core items included pre-tax gains of $225 million from the sale of the Argentina operations and $22 million from the sale of an interest in a Colombia pipeline.  Non-core pre-tax charges included $163 million related to the early redemption of $1.4 billion face value of debt, $35 million write-off of the entire accumulated cost of exploration properties in Libya and non-recurring charges for state and foreign taxes of $62 million.  This resulted in net income of $1.5 billion or $1.90 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.
We reorganized our Permian operations into two business units.  One unit will hold the CO flood assets and the other will operate the
2
 
 
 
 
conventional production.  In connection with these, we moved the production from Southwest Texas, which was previously part of Midcontinent and other, into the Permian.  Midcontinent and other includes production from the recently acquired South Texas and North Dakota properties.
Natural Gas Liquids account for about 10 percent of our oil and gas volumes and sell at a discount to crude oil.  Starting this quarter, we are reporting NGL and crude oil production and sales volumes separately as opposed to the previously disclosed combined liquids volumes.  See the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules for the 2010 quarterly realized prices and production and sales volumes reflecting these changes.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
first quarter.
Oil and gas segment and core earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $2.5 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2010.  Realized prices increased 24 percent for crude oil in 2011 and 11 percent for NGL prices on a year-over-year basis but domestic natural gas prices declined 25 percent from the first quarter of 2010.  Sales volumes for the first quarter of 2011 were 728,000 BOE per day, a 6 percent increase compared with 685,000 BOE per day for the first quarter of 2010.

Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $219 million, which were greater than our earlier guidance.  These results are among the best ever reported for the Chemical segments first quarter operations, which is historically a weak quarter due to seasonal factors.  First quarter operations were positively impacted by strong export demand and improved supply/demand balances across most products resulting in higher margins, including higher demand for calcium chloride resulting from the severe winter storms in the Northeast and Midwest sections of the United States.
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $114 million, compared to $202 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $94 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The decrease from fourth quarter earnings was mainly due to lower marketing and trading income.
The worldwide effective tax rate on core income was 40 percent for the first quarter of 2011, which is in line with our guidance.
for the first quarter of 2011 was $1.3 billion.  Of this, about 88 percent was in oil and gas, 10 percent in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.  We are currently operating 16 rigs in the Permian
Capital spending

and 24 rigs in California, compared to 5 and 11 rigs, respectively, in the first quarter of 2010.
for the first three months of 2011 was $2.2 billion.  In addition, we received $2.7 billion in proceeds from the sale of assets and used $1.3 billion of the companys cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $3.0 billion on acquisitions.  We used $310 million to pay dividends and $1.5 billion to retire debt.  We borrowed $1.0 billion at quarter end for short-term needs, which has now been repaid.  These and other net cash flows reduced our $2.6 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $500 million to $2.1 billion at March 31.  Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition and debt activity was about $500 million.
Cash flow from operations
Acquisitions
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the first three months of 2011 were 812.6 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.4 million.

Our debt to capitalization ratio declined to 12 percent, compared with 14 percent at the end of last year.  Our remaining outstanding debt has an average interest rate of 3.7 percent.
