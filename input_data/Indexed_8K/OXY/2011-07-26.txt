Item 8.01.
Other Events
On July 26, 2011, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced core income of $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.1 billion ($1.32 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2010.  Net income was $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.1 billion ($1.31 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.6 billion for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.9 billion for the same period in 2010.  The increase in the second quarter of 2011 earnings was due mainly to higher crude oil prices.
For the second quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 715,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 701,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2010.  As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 11,000 BOE per day, with another 1,000 BOE per day reduction at THUMS in Long Beach.
The second quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 42,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by reduced volumes in the Middle East / North Africa.  The domestic increase was mainly from the new acquisitions in South Texas and the North Dakota Williston Basin.  The Middle East/North Africa was lower primarily due to the lack of production in Libya and price impacts on production sharing contracts, partially offset by production from Iraq coming on line in 2011 and higher volumes from the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
 
 
 
 
Daily sales volumes remained flat at 705,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 705,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2010.  The 2011 sales volumes were lower than the production volumes due to the timing of liftings in Iraq, Qatar and Oman.
Second quarter realized prices improved for all products on a year-over-year basis.  The price for worldwide crude oil was $103.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $74.39 per barrel for the second quarter of 2010.  The second quarter of 2011 realized oil price represents 101 percent of the average WTI price for the quarter.  Worldwide NGL prices were $57.67 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $44.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010.  Domestic gas prices increased from $4.19 per MCF in the second quarter of 2010 to $4.27 per MCF for the second quarter of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $253 million, compared with $108 million for the same period in 2010.  The second quarter of 2011 results reflect continued strong export sales demand and higher margins resulting from improved supply and demand balances across most products.
Midstream segment earnings were $187 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $13 million for the second quarter of 2010. Higher earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were primarily due to higher margins in the marketing business and improved earnings in our pipeline businesses.
Year-to-date 2011 core results were over $3.4 billion ($4.19 per diluted share), compared with $2.2 billion ($2.67 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.  Net income for the first six months of 2011 was $3.4 billion ($4.13 per diluted share), compared with $2.1 billion ($2.61 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $5.1 billion for the six months of 2011, compared with $3.7 billion for the same period of 2010.  The $1.4 billion increase in the 2011 results reflected higher crude oil and NGL prices and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
Daily oil and gas production volumes for the six months were 723,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 701,000 BOE per day for the 2010 period.  Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production sharing and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia production by 14,000 BOE per day.
Domestic volumes increased primarily due to new operations in South Texas and the Williston Basin, partially offset by lower gas volumes in California.  The Middle East/North Africas production declined due to impacts of price and other factors on production sharing contracts, lower production in Libya and planned maintenance in Dolphin.  Partially offsetting these declines were increases from the new production in Iraq and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
Daily sales volumes were 717,000 BOE in the first six months of 2011, compared with 695,000 BOE for 2010.
 
 
 
 
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil and NGLs but declined for natural gas on a year-over-year basis.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $97.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011, compared with $74.24 per barrel for the six months of 2010.  Worldwide NGL prices were $55.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011, compared with $45.73 per barrel in the six months of 2010.  Domestic gas prices declined from $4.90 per MCF in the six months of 2010 to $4.24 per MCF in the six months of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings were $472 million for the six months of 2011, compared with $138 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 six-month results reflect strong export sales demand and higher margins resulting from improved supply and demand balances across most products.
Midstream segment earnings were $301 million for the six months of 2011, compared with $107 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 results reflect higher margins in the marketing and trading business and improved results in the pipeline business.

For Immediate Release: July 26, 2011
LOS ANGELES, July 26, 2011 -- (NYSE:OXY) announced core income of $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.1 billion ($1.32 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2010.  Net income was $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.1 billion ($1.31 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2010.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation
In announcing the results, Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, The second quarter 2011 net income of $1.8 billion was an increase of 17 percent over the first quarter results.  Improved earnings in all of our business segments resulted in a six month, year-to-date cash flow from operations of $5.6 billion and an annualized return on equity of 20 percent.  Our second quarter domestic oil and gas production grew 11 percent from the second quarter of the prior year to 424,000 BOE per day.
 
  
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.6 billion for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $1.9 billion for the same period in 2010.  The increase in the second quarter of 2011 earnings was due mainly to higher crude oil prices.
For the second quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 715,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 701,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2010.  As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 11,000 BOE per day, with another 1,000 BOE per day reduction at THUMS in Long Beach.
The second quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 42,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by reduced volumes in the Middle East / North Africa.  The domestic increase was mainly from the new acquisitions in South Texas and the North Dakota Williston Basin.  The Middle East/North Africa was lower primarily due to the lack of production in Libya and price impacts on production sharing contracts, partially offset by production from Iraq coming on line in 2011 and higher volumes from the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
 
 
 
 
Daily sales volumes remained flat at 705,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 705,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2010.  The 2011 sales volumes were lower than the production volumes due to the timing of liftings in Iraq, Qatar and Oman.
Second quarter realized prices improved for all products on a year-over-year basis.  The price for worldwide crude oil was $103.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $74.39 per barrel for the second quarter of 2010.  The second quarter of 2011 realized oil price represents 101 percent of the average WTI price for the quarter.  Worldwide NGL prices were $57.67 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $44.08 per barrel in the second quarter of 2010.  Domestic gas prices increased from $4.19 per MCF in the second quarter of 2010 to $4.27 per MCF for the second quarter of 2011.
                        
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $253 million, compared with $108 million for the same period in 2010.  The second quarter of 2011 results reflect continued strong export sales demand and higher margins resulting from improved supply and demand balances across most products.
       
Midstream segment earnings were $187 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared with $13 million for the second quarter of 2010. Higher earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were primarily due to higher margins in the marketing business and improved earnings in our pipeline businesses.
   
Year-to-date 2011 core results were over $3.4 billion ($4.19 per diluted share), compared with $2.2 billion ($2.67 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.  Net income for the first six months of 2011 was $3.4 billion ($4.13 per diluted share), compared with $2.1 billion ($2.61 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.
  
Oil and gas segment earnings were $5.1 billion for the six months of 2011, compared with $3.7 billion for the same period of 2010.  The $1.4 billion increase in the 2011 results reflected higher crude oil and NGL prices and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
Daily oil and gas production volumes for the six months were 723,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 701,000 BOE per day for the 2010 period.  Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production sharing and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia production by 14,000 BOE per day.
 
 
 
 
Domestic volumes increased primarily due to new operations in South Texas and the Williston Basin, partially offset by lower gas volumes in California.  The Middle East/North Africas production declined due to impacts of price and other factors on production sharing contracts, lower production in Libya and planned maintenance in Dolphin.  Partially offsetting these declines were increases from the new production in Iraq and higher production in the Mukhaizna field in Oman.
Daily sales volumes were 717,000 BOE in the first six months of 2011, compared with 695,000 BOE for 2010.
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil and NGLs but declined for natural gas on a year-over-year basis.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $97.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011, compared with $74.24 per barrel for the six months of 2010.  Worldwide NGL prices were $55.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011, compared with $45.73 per barrel in the six months of 2010.  Domestic gas prices declined from $4.90 per MCF in the six months of 2010 to $4.24 per MCF in the six months of 2011.
 
      
 
Chemical segment earnings were $472 million for the six months of 2011, compared with $138 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 six-month results reflect strong export sales demand and higher margins resulting from improved supply and demand balances across most products.
 
Midstream segment earnings were $301 million for the six months of 2011, compared with $107 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 results reflect higher margins in the marketing and trading business and improved results in the pipeline business.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you Chris.
I will now discuss the second quarter results for the Company and Steve Chazen will follow with guidance for the second half of the year.
Core income was $1.8 billion or $2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter this year, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.32 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.  Net income was $1.8 billion or $2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter this year, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
second quarter.
Oil and gas segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $2.6 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the same period of 2010.  The improvement in 2011 was driven mainly by higher commodity prices.  The second quarter 2011 realized prices increased on a year-over-year basis by 39 percent for crude oil, 31 percent for NGLs and 2 percent for domestic natural gas prices.  Sales volumes for the second quarters of 2011 and 2010
 
 
 
 
were flat at 705,000 BOE per day. Production volumes were 715,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2011, compared to 701,000 in the second quarter of 2010.
The production guidance assumptions we gave you in last quarters conference call were at a $95 WTI average price assumption.  The actual average second quarter oil price of $102.56 reduced our production volumes by about 5,000 BOE per day.
 
 
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $253 million, compared to $219 million in the first quarter of 2011.  The second
 
 
 
 
quarter results, one of the highest ever reported for the Chemical segment, reflect higher margins and volumes across most product lines.
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $187 million, compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $13 million in the second quarter of 2010.  The increase from first quarter earnings was mainly due to higher marketing income and improved margins in the gas processing business.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 38 percent for the second quarter of 2011.  Our higher proportionate domestic income brought us closer to the U.S. statutory rates.  Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule.
Let me now turn to Occidentals performance during the .
first six months
Core income was over $3.4 billion or $4.19 per diluted share, compared with $2.2 billion or $2.67 per diluted share in 2010.  Net income was $3.4 billion or $4.13 per diluted share for the first six months of 2011, compared with $2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share in 2010.
for the first six months of 2011 was $5.6 billion.  We used $3.0 billion of the companys total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.2 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures.  We used $685 million to pay dividends and $1.0 billion to retire debt.  These and other net cash flows resulted in a $2.0 billion cash balance at June 30.  Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition and debt activity was about $1.8 billion.
Cash flow from operations
was $3.0 billion for the first six months of which $1.6 billion was spent in the second quarter.  Year to-date capital
Capital spending
 
 
 
 
expenditures by segment were 85 percent in oil and gas, 13 percent in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.
Our net in the first six months were $1.2 billion, which are net of proceeds from the sale of our Argentina operations.  The acquisitions included the South Texas purchase, a payment in connection with the signing of the Shah Field Development Project and properties in California and the Permian.
acquisition expenditures
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the first six months of 2011 were 812.5 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.3 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio declined to 11 percent, compared with 14 percent at the end of last year.  Oxys annualized return on equity for the first half of 2011 was 20 percent.
Copies of the press release announcing our second quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SECs EDGAR system.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss the guidance for the third quarter.
