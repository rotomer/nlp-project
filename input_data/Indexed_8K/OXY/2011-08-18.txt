Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
        On August 15, 2011, Occidental Petroleum Corporation ("Occidental") entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as the representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which Occidental agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of its 1.75% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $900 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"). The public offering price was 99.046% of the principal amount in the case of the 2017 Notes and 98.093% of the principal amount in the case of the 2022 Notes. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $2.1 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include ordinary course working capital increases, acquisitions, retirement of debt, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.
        The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Occidental, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of Occidental and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions.
        The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 18, 2011, between Occidental and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by an Officers' Certificate, dated as of August 18, 2011, setting forth the specific terms applicable to the Notes (the "Officers' Certificate"). The 2017 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.75% per year, and the 2022 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 3.125% per year. Interest on the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2012.
        The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of Occidental and its consolidated subsidiaries to, among other things, create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and the ability of Occidental to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets.
        Occidental may redeem some or all of the Notes of any series at any time or from time to time at the redemption prices set forth in such Notes.
        The Notes were sold pursuant to Occidental's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-176308) under the Securities Act of 1933. Occidental has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a final prospectus supplement, dated August 15, 2011, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated August 15, 2011, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes.
        For a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, please refer to the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate, the form of the 2017 Note and the form of the 2022 Note, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, respectively.

as Representatives of the several Underwriters
Ladies and Gentlemen:
        Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
Company
"), confirms its agreement with the underwriters listed on (collectively the "
Schedule A
Underwriters
," which term also includes any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 11) with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of (i) $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.750% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "
2017 Notes
") and (ii) $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "
2022 Notes
" and, together with the 2017 Notes, the "
Notes
") and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective principal amounts of Notes set forth opposite their names on . The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 18, 2011 (the "
Schedule A
Indenture
," which term, for purposes of this Agreement, includes the Officers' Certificate with respect to the Notes delivered pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "
Trustee
"). Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will be the representatives of the Underwriters (the "
Representatives
;" in the event that there is only one such representative, then all references herein to the "
Representatives
" are deemed to mean and refer to such single representative, mutatis mutandis).
        The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission
") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-176308) for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
1933 Act
"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "
1933 Act Regulations
"). Such registration statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(e)
of the 1933 Act Regulations, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "
1939 Act
"). Such registration statement (as amended by any subsequent post-effective amendments thereto) and the prospectus dated August 15, 2011 (the "
Base Prospectus
"), together with the final prospectus supplement dated August 15, 2011 (the "
Final Prospectus Supplement
") relating to the Notes, including, in each case, all Incorporated Documents (as hereinafter defined) and, solely in the case of any such registration statement, the information that is deemed pursuant to Rule 430B of the 1933 Act Regulations to be part of such registration statement ("
Rule 430B Information
"), are referred to herein as the "
Registration Statement
" and the "
Prospectus
," respectively, except that, if any revised prospectus or any revised or additional prospectus supplement filed by the Company is provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes (including for delivery upon request of purchasers of Notes pursuant to Rule 173 of the 1933 Act Regulations), the term "
Prospectus
" will refer to such revised prospectus or any such revised or additional prospectus supplement, as the case may be, from and after the time it is first provided to the Underwriters for such use. As used herein, the term "
preliminary prospectus
" means any prospectus supplement filed by the Company relating to the Notes that is captioned "Subject to Completion" or "preliminary prospectus supplement" or that has a similar caption, together with the Base Prospectus, including all Incorporated Documents, it being understood that all references herein to a "
preliminary prospectus
" include, without limitation, the Statutory Prospectus (as defined below).

1934 Act
"), and so incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference (other than information in such documents, financial statements and schedules that is deemed not to be filed) (such incorporated documents, financial statements and schedules being herein called the "
Incorporated Documents
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement any prospectus supplement prepared or filed with respect to an offering pursuant to the Registration Statement of any securities other than the Notes will not be deemed to have supplemented any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus and the information therein will not be deemed Rule 430B Information. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus, or to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Issuer General Use Free Writing Prospectus or Issuer Limited Use Free Writing Prospectus (as such terms are hereinafter defined) or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing are deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("

    Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to distribute, in connection with any Foreign Offers and Sales, only those Prospectuses used in connection therewith that have been appropriately "stickered" for use in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Offers and Sales are to be made.
        
(ii)
   With respect to the United Kingdom, each Underwriter represents and agrees, severally and not jointly, that: (A) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended ("
FSMA
")) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA would not apply to the Company; and (B) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
        
(iii)
  In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "
Relevant Member State
"), each Underwriter represents and agrees, severally and not jointly, that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "
Relevant Implementation Date
") it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State other than:
        (A)  to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
        (B)  to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Representatives for any such offer; or
        (C)  in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of Notes shall require us or any underwriter to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this subparagraph (
iii
), the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State) and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State, and the expression "2010 PD Amending Directive" means Directive 2010/73/EU.

(i)
    against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7(c), the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, insofar as such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arises out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
        
(ii)
   against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7(c), the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever, insofar as such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
        
(iii)
  against any and all expense whatsoever (including, subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7(c), the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), as incurred, reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission;
provided, however
, that this indemnity will not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (A) to the extent arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon the Form T-1 under the 1939 Act filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; or (B) as to which such Underwriter may be required to indemnify the Company pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 7.
        (b)
    Indemnification of the Company.
    Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection 7(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or such amendment or supplement).
        (c)
    General.
    
        
(i)
    In case any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) is brought against any Underwriter, any officer or director of such Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, based upon the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company pursuant to this Section 7, such Underwriter, officer, director or controlling person will promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company will assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives and payment of all expenses. Failure to give such notice will not relieve the Company from any liability under this Section 7 to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event will not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of the indemnity contained in this Section 7 . Any such Underwriter, any such officer or director or any such controlling person will have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be at the expense of such Underwriter, such officer or director or such controlling person, unless (A) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (B) the Company has failed to assume the defense and employ reasonably satisfactory counsel or (C) the named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include such Underwriter, such officer or director or such controlling person and the Company, and such Underwriter, such officer or director or such controlling person has been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from, or additional to, those available to the Company (in which case, if such Underwriter, such officer or director or such controlling person notifies the Company in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Company, the Company will not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of such Underwriter, such officer or director or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company will not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one separate firm of attorneys acting as local counsel) for all such Underwriters, all such officers and directors and all such controlling persons, which firm will be designated in writing by the Representatives, on behalf of all of such Underwriters, all such officers and directors and such controlling persons).
        
(ii)
   In case any action, suit or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) is brought against the Company, any of the Company's directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company, with respect to which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to this Section 7, such Underwriter will have the rights and duties given to the Company by subsection 7(c)(
i
) with respect thereto (provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any authorization of the nature specified in clause (A) of subsection Section 7(c)(
i
) may be given only by the Representatives and copies of all notices given by the Company, any such officer or director or any such controlling person of the nature specified in such subsection 7(c)(
i
) will also be sent to the Representatives), and the Company, such directors and officers and any such controlling persons will have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by subsection 7(c)(
i
) with respect thereto, it being understood, however, that the Underwriters will not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one separate firm of attorneys acting as local counsel) for the Company, all such officers and directors and all such controlling persons, which firm will be designated in writing by the Company, on behalf of the Company, all such officers and directors and such controlling persons.
SECTION 8.
    
Contribution.    
        In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 7 is for any reason held to be unenforceable with respect to the indemnified parties, although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company and the Underwriters will contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company and the Underwriters, as incurred, (
i
) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes or (
ii
) if the allocation provided by clause (
i
) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (
i
) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, will be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, on the other hand, bear to the total price to public of the Notes as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes set forth opposite their names in , and not joint.

If Securities of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of such series may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Thirteen, or a combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner
provided in this Section.  The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 1306.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, (2) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
(f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, by or pursuant to an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date, if so fixed, may vary from that specified in Section 316(c) of the Trust Indenture Act.  If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Securities or Outstanding Securities of a series, as the case may be, have authorized or agreed or consented to such request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities or Outstanding Securities of the series, as the case may be, shall be computed as of such record date; provided, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on the record date shall be deemed effective, unless such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of Clause (a) of this Section 104 not later than six months after the record date.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities; and the Trustee, in accordance with such Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; , that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, (a) such Company Order may be delivered by the Company to the Trustee prior to the delivery to the Trustee of such Securities for authentication and delivery, (b) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the aggregate principal amount established for such series, pursuant to a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order, (c) the rate or rates of interest, if any, the Stated Maturity or Maturities, the original issue date or dates, the redemption or repurchase provisions, if any, and any other terms of Securities of such series shall be determined by a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures and (d) if provided for in such procedures, such Company Order may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to electronic instructions from the Company, or the Company's duly authorized agent or agents designated in an Officers' Certificate; and provided, further, that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security or coupon shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any Person who is not a Non-United States Holder or to any location in the United States.  Except as permitted by Section 306, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security, unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled.
provided, however
In authenticating Securities, the form or terms of which have been established in or pursuant to one or more Officers' Certificates as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive upon request, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
 
(a) that the form and terms of such Securities, including any coupons, have been duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(b) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to customary exceptions;
 
provided, however
, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall receive such Opinion of Counsel only once, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series, and that the Opinion of Counsel above may state:
 
(y) that the forms of such Securities have been, and the terms of such Securities (when established in accordance with such procedures as may be specified from time to time in a Company Order, all as contemplated by and in accordance with a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 301, as the case may be) will have been, duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(z) that such Securities, together with the coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, when (1) executed by the Company, (2) completed, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and (3) issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to customary exceptions.
 
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series, unless and until it has received written notification that such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked.  In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Company's instructions
to authenticate and deliver such Securities do not violate any rules, regulations or orders of any governmental agency or commission having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding three paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are subject to a Periodic Offering, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such Officers' Certificate is delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
 
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.  The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities.  Unless otherwise provided in the appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.
 
No Security or coupon appertaining thereto shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, together with a written statement stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Section 304
.  Temporary Securities.
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form or, if authorized, in bearer form, with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.  Such temporary Securities may be in global form.
 
Except in the case of Securities represented by a temporary global Security (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the three succeeding paragraphs), if temporary Securities for some or all of the Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities representing such Securities to be
prepared without unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of such definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities of like tenor upon surrender of such temporary Securities at any office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 1002 in a Place of Payment for such series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such series, without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations; , that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
provided, however
 
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if Bearer Securities of any series are represented by a Security in temporary global form, any such temporary global Security shall be delivered to the Depositary for the benefit of Euro-clear or Clearstream, for credit to the respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct).
 
Without unnecessary delay, but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global Security (the ""), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of the same series, in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in definitive bearer form or registered form, or shall be represented by a definitive global Security, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof.
Exchange Date
 
Unless otherwise specified in any such temporary global Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series represented by such temporary global Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date, when the account holder instructs Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his, her or its behalf and delivers to Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be, any certificate specified as contemplated by Section 301.  Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like, in the event that such Person does not take delivery
of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be.
 
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary global Security representing a series of Bearer Securities on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be, on such Interest Payment Date, upon delivery by Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to the Trustee of any certificate specified as contemplated by Section 301, for credit, without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date, to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to Euro-clear or Clearstream, as the case may be, any certificate specified as contemplated by Section 301.
 
Section 305
.  Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
 
(1) The Company shall cause to be kept, at one of its offices or agencies maintained pursuant to Section 1002, a register for the Securities accessible to the Trustee (the register maintained in such office or agency designated pursuant to Section 1002 being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register"), in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities.  The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
 
(2) Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at an office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or a duly appointed co-authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series and of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.
 
(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions (other than the provisions set forth in paragraphs (7) and (8)) of this Section, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary, or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary, or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(4) At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, terms and tenor, upon surrender
of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities.
 
(5) At the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, terms and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining.  If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment, in funds acceptable to the Company and the Trustee, in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless.  If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and terms and like tenor after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided, however
 
(6) Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or a duly appointed authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
(7) If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series, or if such Depositary shall cease to be eligible to act as such in respect of the Securities of such series, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of, and having the same tenor and terms as, the Security or Securities in global form representing such series, in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form in accordance with the instructions, if any, of the Depositary.
 
(8) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more global Securities shall no longer be represented by such global Security or Securities.  In such event, or if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and shall be continuing, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of, and having the same tenor and terms as, the Security or Securities in global form representing such series, in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form in accordance with the instructions, if any, of the Depositary.
 
(9) Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified in the preceding two paragraphs or as contemplated by Section 301, any definitive global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph.  If the beneficial owners of interests in a definitive global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities of such series and of like principal amount and tenor but of another authorized form and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, without unnecessary delay, but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such definitive global Security, executed by the Company.  On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such definitive global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such definitive global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such definitive global Security to be exchanged, which, unless the Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; , that notwithstanding the last paragraph of this Section 305, no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date; and provided, further, that in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security or coupon delivered in exchange for a portion of a definitive global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any Person that is not a Non-United States Holder or to any location in the United States. If a Registered Security is issued in
provided, however
exchange for any portion of a definitive global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such definitive global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
 
(10) Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in definitive form, such Security in global form shall be cancelled by the Trustee. All cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary practice and a certificate of such disposition delivered to the Company upon the Company's written request, unless the Company directs that such cancelled Securities be returned to it. Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to this Section 305 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee.  The Trustee shall deliver such Registered Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
(11) All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
(12) Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
(13) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer, other than exchanges upon the Company's repurchase or redemption of any Securities in part at the option of the Holders thereof not involving any transfer, and other than exchanges of global Securities (or portions thereof) for Securities in definitive form in accordance with Section 305.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending (except
 
as otherwise provided in the first proviso of the third sentence of paragraph (9) of this Section 305) at the close of business on (A) if Securities of the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if Securities of the series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Registered Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption, except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, terms and principal amount, provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption.
 
Section 306
.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities and Coupons.
 
If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Security of the same series of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute, and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon; , that principal of and any interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.
provided, however
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security and coupons, if any, shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that issue and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
 
Section 307
.  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date, and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
 
Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities, at his, her or its address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and interest to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
Section 308
.  Persons Deemed Owners.
 
Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 and subject to Section 305 and Section 307) interest on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any coupon as the absolute owner of such Bearer Security or coupon, as the case may be, for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or
not such Bearer Security or coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
 
Section 309

All Bearer Securities and unmatured coupons so delivered shall be held by the Trustee and, upon instruction by a Company Order, shall be cancelled or held for reissuance.  Bearer Securities and unmatured coupons held for reissuance may be reissued only in replacement of mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed Bearer Securities of the same series and like tenor and terms or the related coupons pursuant to Section 306.  All Bearer Securities and unmatured coupons held by the Trustee pending such cancellation or reissuance shall be deemed to be delivered for cancellation for all purposes of this Indenture and the Securities.  The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever (including Securities received by the Company in exchange or payment for other securities of the Company), and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee.  No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted in the form of Securities for any particular series or as permitted pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.  All cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee may be disposed of and certification of their disposition delivered to the Company upon the Company's written request, unless by a Company Order the Company shall direct that such Securities be returned to it.  Any cancelled Securities not disposed of shall be returned to the Company.
 
Section 310
.  Computation of Interest.
 
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, (i) interest on any Securities which bear interest at a fixed rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and (ii) interest on any Securities which bear interest at a variable rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in an interest period divided by 360.
Section 311.  CUSIP Numbers.
 
The Company in issuing Securities of any series may use CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers if then generally in use, and thereafter with respect to such series, the Trustee may use such numbers in any notice of redemption, repurchase or exchange, as a convenience to Holders, with respect to such series; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities of such series or as contained in any notice of a redemption, repurchase or exchange and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities of such series, and any such redemption, repurchase or exchange shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in CUSIP, ISIN or other similar numbers.

Section 502
.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of and accrued interest, if any, on all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal (or portion thereof) and accrued interest, if any, shall become immediately due and payable.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities or, if no such rate or rates is prescribed therefor in such Securities, at the rate of interest borne by such Securities; and
 
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amount due the Trustee under Section 607;
 
and
 
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of and interest on Securities of such series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
 
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 503
.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
 
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof,
 
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest from the date such interest was due, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities or, if no such rate or rates is prescribed therefor in such Securities, at the rate of interest borne by such Securities; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amount due the Trustee under Section 607.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, in its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amount due the Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of Securities and coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
 
then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by written notice to the Trustee, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months (or such shorter period as the Securities have been outstanding) may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

provided, however
 
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; , that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities (other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
 
(1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as such Paying Agent and hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of or interest on Securities of such series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; , that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons.

On and after November 15, 2021, the Notes are redeemable, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the relevant Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of the Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of the Indenture.
        
"Adjusted Treasury Rate"

"Comparable Treasury Price"
means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, such average in any case to be determined by the Quotation Agent, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.

        Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Notes to be redeemed, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price (or any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes or portions thereof to be redeemed), on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
        All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed, that on the
Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
