Section 8  Other Events
  
Item 8.01.
Other Events
On October 27, 2011, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced earnings from continuing operations of $1.8 billion ($2.18 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $1.2 billion ($1.48 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010.  Net income was $1.8 billion ($2.17 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2011, compared with the $1.2 billion ($1.46 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.6 billion for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $1.8 billion for the same period in 2010.  The increase in the third quarter of 2011 earnings was due to higher volumes and liquids prices.
For the third quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 739,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 706,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2010.  As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 13,000 BOE per day, with another 1,000 BOE per day reduction at THUMS in Long Beach.
The third quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 56,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia.  The domestic increase was from Midcontinent and Other, including the new acquisitions in South Texas and the North Dakota Williston Basin, and California.  The Middle East/North Africa was lower primarily due to the lack of production in Libya and price impacts on production sharing contracts, partially offset by higher production from our traditional areas in Oman and Mukhaizna and Iraq production that came on line in 2011.  Colombia production was lower due to pipeline interruptions caused by insurgent activity.
 
 
 
 
Daily sales volumes increased from 713,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2010 to 743,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2011.  The 2011 sales volumes were higher than the production volumes due to the timing of liftings.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $97.24 per barrel for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $72.31 per barrel for the third quarter of 2010.  The third quarter of 2011 realized oil price represents 108 percent of the average WTI and 87 percent of the average Brent price for the quarter.  About 60 percent of Oxys oil production tracks world oil prices and 40 percent is indexed to WTI.  Worldwide NGL prices were $56.06 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $39.70 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010.  Domestic gas prices increased slightly from $4.20 per MCF in the third quarter of 2010 to $4.23 per MCF for the third quarter of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $245 million, compared to $189 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The improvement in third quarter results on a year-over-year basis reflects higher pricing across most product lines, which more than offset higher feedstock costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $163 million for the third quarter of 2010.  The decline in earnings for the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower trading results, partially offset by higher income from our pipeline and power generation businesses.
Year-to-date 2011 core income was over $5.2 billion ($6.37 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.14 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.  Net income for the first nine months of 2011 was $5.1 billion ($6.31 per diluted share), compared with $3.3 billion ($4.07 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $7.7 billion for the nine months of 2011, compared with $5.5 billion for the same period of 2010.  The $2.2 billion increase in the 2011 results reflected higher crude oil and NGL prices and sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
Oil and gas production volumes for the nine months were 728,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 703,000 BOE per day for the 2010 period.  Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production sharing and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia production by 14,000 BOE per day.
Domestic volumes increased primarily due to new operations in South Texas and the Williston Basin.  Middle East/North Africa production declined due to impacts of price and other factors on production sharing contracts and lower production in Libya, partially offset by new production in Iraq and higher production in Omans Mukhaizna field.
Daily sales volumes were 726,000 BOE in the first nine months of 2011, compared with 701,000 BOE for 2010.
 
 
 
 
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil and NGLs but declined for natural gas on a year-over-year basis.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $97.33 per barrel for the nine months of 2011, compared with $73.58 per barrel for the nine months of 2010.  Worldwide NGL prices were $55.63 per barrel for the nine months of 2011, compared with $43.66 per barrel in the nine months of 2010.  Domestic gas prices declined from $4.67 per MCF in the nine months of 2010 to $4.24 per MCF in the nine months of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings were $717 million for the nine months of 2011, compared with $327 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 nine month results reflect strong export sales and higher margins resulting from higher demand across most products.
Midstream segment earnings were $378 million for the nine months of 2011, compared with $270 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 results reflect higher pipeline income and increased margins in our power generation business.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: October 27, 2011
LOS ANGELES, October 27, 2011 -- (NYSE:OXY) announced earnings from continuing operations of $1.8 billion ($2.18 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $1.2 billion ($1.48 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010. Net income was $1.8 billion ($2.17 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2011, compared with the $1.2 billion ($1.46 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation
In announcing the results, Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, The third quarter 2011 income of $1.8 billion was 48 percent higher than the same period of 2010. The third quarter 2011 domestic production was 436,000 BOE per day, the highest in Occidentals history, and total sales were 743,000 BOE per day.
We continue to generate strong financial results with cash flow from operations of $8.6 billion for the first nine months of 2011 and annualized ROE of 20 percent.
 
QUARTERLY RESULTS
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.6 billion for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $1.8 billion for the same period in 2010. The increase in the third quarter of 2011 earnings was due to higher volumes and liquids prices.
For the third quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 739,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 706,000 BOE in the third quarter of 2010. As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 13,000 BOE per day, with another 1,000 BOE per day reduction at THUMS in Long Beach.
The third quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 56,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia. The domestic increase was from Midcontinent and Other, including the new acquisitions in South Texas and the North Dakota Williston Basin, and California.  The Middle East/North Africa was lower primarily due to the lack of production in Libya and
 
 
 
 
price impacts on production sharing contracts, partially offset by higher production from our traditional areas in Oman and Mukhaizna and Iraq production that came on line in 2011. Colombia production was lower due to pipeline interruptions caused by insurgent activity.
Daily sales volumes increased from 713,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2010 to 743,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2011. The 2011 sales volumes were higher than the production volumes due to the timing of liftings.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $97.24 per barrel for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $72.31 per barrel for the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter of 2011 realized oil price represents 108 percent of the average WTI and 87 percent of the average Brent price for the quarter. About 60 percent of Oxys oil production tracks world oil prices and 40 percent is indexed to WTI. Worldwide NGL prices were $56.06 per barrel in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $39.70 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010. Domestic gas prices increased slightly from $4.20 per MCF in the third quarter of 2010 to $4.23 per MCF for the third quarter of 2011.
       
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $245 million, compared to $189 million in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement in third quarter results on a year-over-year basis reflects higher pricing across most product lines, which more than offset higher feedstock costs.

Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared with $163 million for the third quarter of 2010. The decline in earnings for the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower trading results, partially offset by higher income from our pipeline and power generation businesses
   
.
Year-to-date 2011 core income was over $5.2 billion ($6.37 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.14 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010. Net income for the first nine months of 2011 was $5.1 billion ($6.31 per diluted share), compared with $3.3 billion ($4.07 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010

Oil and gas production volumes for the nine months were 728,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 703,000 BOE per day for the 2010 period. Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production sharing and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia production by 14,000 BOE per day.
 
 
 
 
Domestic volumes increased primarily due to new operations in South Texas and the Williston Basin. Middle East/North Africa production declined due to impacts of price and other factors on production sharing contracts and lower production in Libya, partially offset by new production in Iraq and higher production in Omans Mukhaizna field.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you Chris.
Core income was $1.8 billion or $2.18 per diluted share in the third quarter this year, compared to $1.2 billion or $1.48 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.  Net income was $1.8 billion or $2.17 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.  The small difference between net and core income is due to discontinued operations.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
third quarter.
Oil and gas segment earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $2.6 billion, the same as the second quarter of 2011 and compared to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2010.  Higher volumes this quarter, compared to the second quarter of 2011, resulted in flat quarter to quarter income despite lower product prices.  The improvement in 2011, over the same period in 2010, was driven by higher production and liquids prices.  The third quarter 2011 realized prices increased on a year-over-year basis by 34 percent for
 
 
 
 
crude oil, 41 percent for NGLs and remained about flat for domestic natural gas.  Sales volumes, which are different than production volumes due to the timing of liftings, were 743,000 BOE per day, compared to 713,000 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2010.  Our production was 739,000 BOE per day, compared to 706,000 in the third quarter of 2010, which included production from Libya.  This represents a greater than 4  percent increase year-over-year, reflecting our continued focus on production growth.  The third quarter production was also more than 3 percent higher than the second quarter 2011 volumes of 715,000 BOE per day.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $245 million, compared to $253 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $189 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The improvement in third quarter results on a year-over-year basis reflects higher margins across most product lines.  In addition, during the third quarter of 2011, we temporarily idled certain production in our Texas plants and sold power to the grid during the power shortage, resulting in an increase in the quarters earnings.
Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $77 million, compared to $187 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $163 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The decreases from the second quarter and prior year third quarter earnings were due to losses from our Phibro unit both for the quarter and year-to-date, partially offset by higher pipeline income and increased power sales to the grid during the third quarter.
 
 
 
 
The worldwide effective tax rate was 38 percent for the third quarter of 2011.  Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule.
Let me now turn to Occidentals performance during the .
first nine months
Core income was $5.2 billion or $6.37 per diluted share, compared with $3.4 billion or $4.14 per diluted share in 2010.  Net income was $5.1 billion or $6.31 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2011, compared with $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share in 2010.
for the first nine months of 2011 was $8.6 billion.  We used $5.0 billion of the companys total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.5 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures.  We used $1.1 billion to pay dividends and had a net cash inflow from debt activity of $0.6 billion.  These and other net cash flows resulted in a $4.0 billion cash balance at September 30.
Cash flow from operations
was $5.0 billion for the first nine months, of which $2.0 billion was spent in the third quarter.  Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 83 percent in oil and gas, 14 percent in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.
Capital spending
Our net in the first nine months were $1.5 billion, which are net of proceeds from the sale of our Argentina operations.  The acquisitions included the South Texas purchase, properties in California and the Permian, and a payment in connection with the signing of the Al Hosn Gas project in Abu Dhabi which is the gas development of the Shah field.  This payment was for Occidentals share of development expenditures incurred by the project prior to the date the final agreement was signed.
acquisition expenditures
 
 
 
 
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the first nine months of 2011 were 812.6 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 813.3 million.
Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 14 percent, the same as at the end of last year.  During the third quarter of 2011, Oxy issued senior notes of $1.3 billion due in 2017 and $900 million due in 2022 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.3 percent, which brought the Companys average effective borrowing rate down to 3.2 percent.
Our annualized return on equity for the first nine months of the year was 20 percent.
Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SECs EDGAR system.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss Oxys strategy to maximize total shareholder return and provide guidance for the fourth quarter.
 
 
 
 
Thank you Jim.
This morning, I want to spend a few minutes discussing Occidentals overriding goal to maximize .  We believe this can be achieved through a combination of:
Total Shareholder Return
Following is an update of our progress to-date:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As we look ahead to the :
fourth quarter of the year
We expect the fourth quarter oil and gas production to be as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally 
So to summarize:
 
 
 
 
Now we're ready to take your questions.
