Item 8.01.
Other Events
On January 25, 2012, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.6 billion ($2.01 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the $1.2 billion ($1.49 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Core income was $1.6 billion ($2.02 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1.3 billion ($1.58 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net income for the twelve months of 2011 was $6.8 billion ($8.32 per diluted share), compared with $4.5 billion ($5.56 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.  Core income for the year 2011 exceeded $6.8 billion ($8.39 per diluted share), compared with $4.7 billion ($5.72 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010.  After excluding 2010 domestic asset impairments, the fourth quarter of 2010 core segment earnings were $1.9 billion.  The increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings was due to higher liquids volumes and prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 748,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 714,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 17,000 BOE per day.
The fourth quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 61,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia. The domestic increase was from South Texas, the Williston Basin and California.  The Middle East/North
 
1
 
 
 
 
Africa was lower due to the decline of production in Libya and the effect of price and other factors on production sharing contracts.
Daily sales volumes increased from 699,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 749,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $99.62 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $79.96 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 realized oil price represents 106 percent of the average WTI and 91 percent of the average Brent price for the quarter. Worldwide NGL prices were $55.25 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $49.17 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010. Domestic gas prices decreased from $4.13 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $3.59 per MCF for the fourth quarter of 2011.
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $144 million, compared to $111 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The improvement in fourth quarter results on a year-over-year basis was primarily due to higher caustic soda pricing, which more than offset higher feedstock costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower marketing and trading results.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $10.2 billion for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $7.2 billion for the same period of 2010.  Oil and gas core earnings, after excluding asset impairments, were $10.3 billion for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $7.4 billion for the same period of 2010. The $2.9 billion increase in the 2011 results reflected higher crude oil and NGL prices and sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
Oil and gas production volumes for twelve months were 733,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 706,000 BOE per day for 2010. Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts lowered the Middle East/North Africa, Colombia and Long Beach production by 18,000 BOE per day.
Domestic volumes increased primarily due to new operations in South Texas, California and the Williston Basin. Middle East/North Africa production declined due to impacts of price and other factors on production sharing contracts and lower production in Libya, partially offset by higher production in Omans Mukhaizna field and Iraq.
Daily sales volumes were 731,000 BOE in 2011, compared with 701,000 BOE for 2010.
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil and NGLs but declined for natural gas on a year-over-year basis. Realizations for crude oil and NGLs rose 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively, and fell 10 percent for natural gas.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $97.92 per barrel for the twelve months of
2011, compared with $75.16 per barrel for 2010. Worldwide NGL prices were $55.53 per barrel for the
2
 
 
 
 
twelve months of 2011, compared with $45.08 per barrel in 2010. Domestic gas prices declined from $4.53 per MCF in 2010 to $4.06 per MCF in 2011.
Chemical segment earnings were $861 million for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $438 million for the same period in 2010.  The 2011 results reflect strong export sales and higher margins resulting from higher demand across most products.
Midstream segment earnings were $448 million for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $472 million for the same period in 2010. The 2011 results reflect lower marketing and trading income, partially offset by higher pipeline income.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: January 25, 2012
LOS ANGELES, January 25, 2012 -- (NYSE:OXY) announced net income of $1.6 billion ($2.01 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with the $1.2 billion ($1.49 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Core income was $1.6 billion ($2.02 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1.3 billion ($1.58 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation
Net income for the twelve months of 2011 was $6.8 billion ($8.32 per diluted share), compared with $4.5 billion ($5.56 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.  Core income for the year 2011 exceeded $6.8 billion ($8.39 per diluted share), compared with $4.7 billion ($5.72 per diluted share) for the same period in 2010.
In announcing the results, Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, The 2011 net income of $6.8 billion was 49-percent higher than 2010.  For the year, we continued to generate strong financial results with cash flow from operations of $12.3 billion and ROE of 19 percent.  We increased our annual dividend by 21 percent to $1.84 per share.
Our domestic fourth quarter oil and gas production of 449,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was the highest in Occidentals history, breaking the previous record achieved last quarter.  The domestic production also reflected our highest ever quarterly volume for liquids.  Total company production was 748,000 BOE per day for the fourth quarter, an increase of nearly 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010.  Total company production for the full year of 2011 was 733,000 BOE per day, an increase of nearly 4 percent from 2010.
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010.  After excluding 2010 domestic
 
 
 
 
 
asset impairments, the fourth quarter of 2010 core segment earnings were $1.9 billion.  The increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 earnings was due to higher liquids volumes and prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 748,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 714,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a result of higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting production sharing and similar contracts, production was reduced in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia by 17,000 BOE per day.
The fourth quarter 2011 production volume increase was a result of 61,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes in the Middle East/North Africa and Colombia. The domestic increase was from South Texas, the Williston Basin and California.  The Middle East/North Africa was lower due to the decline of production in Libya and the effect of price and other factors on production sharing contracts.
Daily sales volumes increased from 699,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 749,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $99.62 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $79.96 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Domestic gas prices decreased from $4.13 per MCF in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $3.59 per MCF for the fourth quarter of 2011.
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $144 million, compared to $111 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The improvement in fourth quarter results on a year-over-year basis was primarily due to higher caustic soda pricing, which more than offset higher feedstock costs.
 
 
Midstream segment earnings were $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $202 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower marketing and trading results.
 
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas segment earnings were $10.2 billion for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $7.2 billion for the same period of 2010.  Oil and gas core earnings, after excluding asset impairments, were $10.3 billion for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $7.4 billion for the same period of 2010. The $2.9 billion increase in the 2011 results reflected higher crude oil and NGL prices and sales volumes, partially offset by higher operating costs and DD&A rates.
 
 
 
 
Oil and gas production volumes for twelve months were 733,000 BOE per day for 2011, compared with 706,000 BOE per day for 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you Chris.
Net income was $1.6 billion or $2.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $1.2 billion or $1.49 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our consolidated pre-tax income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was about $2.6 billion ($2.02 per diluted share after tax), compared to approximately $2.9 billion ($2.18 per diluted share after tax) in the third quarter of 2011.  Major items resulting in the difference between the third and fourth quarter income included higher oil volumes and prices, which added $0.07 per diluted share after-tax to our fourth quarter income, lower fourth quarter chemical and midstream income of $0.08 per diluted share, higher equity-based compensation costs of $0.05 per diluted share, higher exploration expense of $0.02 per diluted share and higher fourth quarter operating costs of $0.08 per diluted share.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
fourth quarter.
 
 
 
 
In the oil and gas segment, the fourth quarter 2011 production of 748,000 BOE per day was 9,000 BOED higher than the third quarter 2011 volumes of 739,000 BOE per day.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $144 million, compared to $245 million in the third quarter of 2011.  The drop in income was the result of seasonal factors.
Midstream segment earnings of $70 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 were comparable to the $77 million in the third quarter of 2011.
The significantly higher year-end Oxy stock price, compared to the distressed levels at the end of the third quarter, affected the quarterly
 
 
 
 
 
 valuation of equity-based compensation plans reducing fourth quarter pre-tax income of the company, compared to the third quarter, by $80 million.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 37 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Our fourth quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedule.
Let me now turn to Occidentals performance during the .
twelve months
Core income was $6.8 billion or $8.39 per diluted share, compared with $4.7 billion or $5.72 per diluted share in 2010.  Net income was $6.8 billion or $8.32 per diluted share for the twelve months of 2011, compared with $4.5 billion or $5.56 per diluted share in 2010.
for the twelve months of 2011 was $12.3 billion.  We used $7.5 billion of the companys total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $2.2 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures.  We used $1.4 billion to pay dividends and had a net cash inflow from debt activity of $0.6 billion.  These and other net cash flows resulted in a $3.8 billion cash balance at December 31.
Cash flow from operations
Looking at overall cash flows simply, our total debt, net of cash, was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010, representing net cash generated by the company of $0.4 billion.  During this period, we returned $1.7 billion to our stockholders in the form of $1.4 billion of dividends, and $275 million of stock buybacks.  Over two years, our net debt at December 31, 2011 was $0.5 billion higher compared to the $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009.  During this period, we returned $2.9 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks while executing an $11.5 billion capital program and spending about $6.9 billion on acquisitions.
 
 
 
 
 
for 2011 were approximately $7.5 billion, of which about $2.6 billion was incurred in the fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter higher capital partially reflected the gradual ramp-up of our program during 2011.  The increases were mostly at Williston domestically, and Iraq, Oman and Qatar internationally.  The fourth quarter capital also included spending for several midstream projects, such as the Elk Hills gas processing plant, which will drop significantly during the first half of 2012 as these projects are completed.  Total year capital expenditures by segment were 82 percent in oil and gas, 14 percent in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.
Capital expenditures
Our net in the twelve months were $2.2 billion, which are net of proceeds from the sale of our Argentina operations.  The acquisitions included the South Texas purchase, properties in California, the Permian and Williston, and a payment in connection with the signing of the Al Hosn Gas project in Abu Dhabi which is the gas development of the Shah field.  This payment was for Occidentals share of development expenditures incurred by the project prior to the date the final agreement was signed.
acquisition expenditures
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months of 2011 were 812.1 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 812.9 million.
Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 13 percent, a decline of 1 percent from the end of last year.
Our return on equity for 2011 was 19.3 percent and the return on capital employed was 17.2 percent.
Oil and Gas DD&A expense was $11.48 per BOE for 2011.  We expect the Oil and Gas segment DD&A rate to be about $14 per barrel in
 
 
 
 
 
2012.  The total Chemical and Midstream DD&A expense is expected to be about $650 million for 2012.
We expect operating costs per barrel to be about $13.75 in 2012.  The 2012 expected costs reflect higher levels of workovers and well maintenance activity.  However, significant and substantial product price changes, and changes in activity levels and inflation resulting from product prices, may affect this cost estimate during the course of the year.
Copies of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SECs EDGAR system.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to discuss our 2012 capital program, year-end oil and gas reserves and provide guidance for the first half of the year.
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you Jim.
We finished a strong year in terms of the three main performance criteria I outlined last quarter.  Our domestic oil and gas production grew by about 12 percent for the total year to 428,000 BOE per day.  Our fourth quarter domestic production of 449,000 BOED was the highest U.S. total production volume in Occidentals history, reflecting the highest ever quarterly volume for liquids of 310,000 barrels per day and the second highest quarterly volume for gas.  Total company production increased about 4 percent for the year.  Our chemical business delivered exceptional results for the year, achieving one of their highest earnings levels ever.  Our return on equity was 19 percent for the year and return on capital was 17 percent.  We increased our annual dividends by $0.32 or by 21 percent, to $1.84 per share.  We expect to announce a further dividend increase after the meeting of our Board of Directors in the second week of February.  I will now turn to our 2012 Capital Program.  As we have discussed before, we have ample
 
 
 
 
legitimate opportunities in our domestic oil and gas business where we could deploy capital.  We have tried to manage the program to a level that is realistic at current price levels, and as a result, have deferred some projects that otherwise would have met our hurdle rates.  We continue to have substantial inventory of high return projects going forward to fulfill our growth objectives.
2012 Capital Program
We are increasing our capital program approximately 10 percent in 2012 to $8.3 billion from the $7.5 billion we spent in 2011.  About $500 million of this increase will be in the United States, mainly in the Permian basin, and the rest in international projects including the Al Hosn sour gas project and Iraq.  The program breakdown is 84 percent in oil and gas, about 11 percent in the Midstream operations and 5 percent for Chemicals. We will review our capital program around mid-year and adjust as conditions dictate.
The following is a geographic overview of the program:

2011 Oil and Gas Reserves
We havent completed the determination of our year-end reserve levels.  Based on preliminary estimates, our reserve replacement ratio from all categories was somewhat over 100 percent.  In the Middle
 
 
 
 
East/North Africa, the highly profitable Dolphin project does not replace its production because of the nature of its contract.  This makes overall reserve replacement for the Middle East/North Africa region very difficult.  Despite this fact, the 2011 program, which includes only the reserve categories of Extensions and Discoveries and Improved Recovery, covered about 70 percent of the regions production.  Oil price increases, which under the production sharing contracts reduce our share of the reserves, and non-fundamental factors in Libya and Iraq essentially negated the reserve adds from the program.  As work progresses, we expect that the Libya and Iraq reserves will be restored.
In the United States, the results of the 2011 program and acquisitions replaced around 250 percent of production with both elements contributing about equal amounts.  After price and other adjustments to prior years estimates, U.S. reserves replacement was well over 150 percent.
Production Outlook
As we look ahead to 2012, we expect oil and gas production to be as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally -
 
 
 
 
 
 
So to summarize:
Now we're ready to take your questions.

Factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations; supply and demand considerations for Occidentals products; general domestic political and regulatory approval conditions; international political conditions; not successfully completing, or any material delay of, any development of new fields, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency-improvement projects, acquisitions or dispositions; potential failure to achieve expected production from existing and future oil and gas development projects; exploration risks such as drilling unsuccessful wells; any general economic recession or slowdown domestically or internationally; higher-than-expected costs; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; potential disruption or interruption of Occidentals production or manufacturing or damage to facilities due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, natural disasters, political events or insurgent activity; failure of risk management; changes in law or regulations; or changes in tax rates. Words such as estimate, project, predict, will, would, should, could, may, might, anticipate, plan, intend, believe, expect or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Material risks that may affect Occidentals results of operations and financial position appear in Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors of the 2010 Form 10-K.
