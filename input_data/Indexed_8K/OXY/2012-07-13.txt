(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 11, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board changed the Return on Equity Incentive (ROEI) awards issued in 2009 to Dr. Ray R. Irani and Stephen I. Chazen to provide for the amounts payable upon certification of the level of achievement of the Performance Goal to be settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares, instead of 100% in cash.  The recipients will retain shares equivalent to the number of net after-tax shares received for at least three years.  The form of amendment to the 2009 ROEI grant agreement is included as Exhibit 10.1.
Additionally, on July 11, 2012, the Compensation Committee authorized grants of incentive awards under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  Dr. Irani and Messrs. Chazen, de Brier, Albrecht, Lowe and Lienert received Total Shareholder Return Incentive (TSRI) awards of a maximum number of performance shares of 212,842, 236,491, 75,677, 75,677, 75,677 and 47,299, respectively, and Restricted Stock Incentive awards of 59,123, 59,123, 18,920, 18,920, 18,920 and 11,825 shares, respectively.  The value of these awards is the same as the value of the awards granted in 2011 based on Occidentals common stock price on the respective grant dates in 2011 and 2012. The forms of award agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3.  The forms are substantially the same as last years except that for both awards, the dates of the performance periods have been revised and for the TSRI, the amounts payable upon certification of the level of achievement of the Performance Goal will be settled 100% in shares instead of 50% in cash and 50% in shares.

SIGNATURE
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.2
The following (these Terms and Conditions) are set forth as of the Date of Grant between OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (Occidental and, with its subsidiaries, the Company), and the Eligible Employee receiving this award (the Grantee).
Terms and Conditions
1.             In accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the Plan), Occidental grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the right to receive in Shares up to the number of Performance Shares.  For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Performance Shares means a bookkeeping entry that records the equivalent of Shares awarded pursuant to Sections 4.2 and, to the extent applicable, 5.2 of the Plan that is payable upon the achievement of the Performance Goal. Performance Shares are not Shares and have no voting rights or, except as stated in Section 6, dividend rights.
Grant of Performance Shares
.
2.             (a) Neither these Terms and Conditions nor any right to receive Shares or cash pursuant to these Terms and Conditions may be transferred or assigned by the Grantee other than (i) to a beneficiary designated on a form approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law), by will or, if the Grantee dies without designating a beneficiary of a valid will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, if applicable, (if approved or ratified by the Committee).
Restrictions on Transfer
.
(b) Further, if the Grantee was a Named Executive Officer during the last completed fiscal year prior to vesting, then such Grantee shall retain Beneficial Ownership of Shares equal to not less than 50% of the net after-tax Shares received under these Terms and Conditions until the third anniversary date of the vesting of the Shares under this Award (the Beneficial Ownership Period). Compliance with the foregoing requirement shall be determined by reference to the reports filed by the Grantee on Forms 3, 4, and 5, as applicable, pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and the aggregate number of Shares reported as Beneficially Owned during the Beneficial Ownership Period shall be not less than the sum of the number of Shares then required to be so owned pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions of any other grant containing this or a similar requirement.  For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Beneficial Ownership has the meaning ascribed in Rule 16a-1(2) under the Exchange Act and Named Executive Officer has the meaning ascribed thereto pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
 
3.             The Performance Goal for the Performance Period is based on Total Shareholder Return (defined as Total Stockholder Return in the Plan) of the Peer Companies listed below and the S&P 500 Index, as set forth on Exhibit 1.  Total Shareholder Return shall be calculated for each Peer Company using the average of its last reported sale price per share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions for the last ten trading days preceding July 1, 2012 and the average of its last reported sale price per share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions for the last ten trading days ending with June 30, 2015.  In addition to Occidental, the Peer Companies are: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, and Total S.A. (collectively, the Peer Companies and individually, a Peer Company); provided however, that consistent with Section 162(m), if at any time during the Performance Period, a Peer Company is acquired, ceases to exist, ceases to be a publicly-traded company at any time during the Performance Period, files for bankruptcy, spins off 25 percent or more of its assets, or sells all, or substantially all, of its assets, then such company will be removed and treated as if it had never been a Peer Company and the achievement of the Performance Goal will be determined with respect to the remaining Peer Companies as set forth on Exhibit 1.
Performance Goal
.
4.             a) If the Grantee fails to accept this award prior to the next record date for the payment of dividends on the Common Stock subsequent to the Date of Grant, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this award, the Grantee shall forfeit all rights under this award and this award will become null and void.  For purposes of this section, acceptance of the award shall occur on the date the Grantee accepts this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Benefit Access or any replacement online system designated by the Company.
Vesting And Forfeiture of Performance Shares
.
(
(b) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the last day of the Performance Period to receive payment of this award.  The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantees employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence.  However, if, prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee dies or becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a Forfeiture Event), then the number of Performance Shares  upon which the Grantee's award is based will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining in the Performance Period following the date of the Forfeiture Event.  If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before the end of the Performance Period, then these Terms and Conditions will terminate automatically on the date of Grantees termination and Grantee shall forfeit the right to receive any Shares or cash hereunder.
(c) The Grantee's right to receive payment of this award in an amount not to exceed the Performance Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole share, will be based on, and become nonforfeitable upon the Committees certification of, the attainment of the Performance Goal.
(d) Notwithstanding Section 4(c), if a Change in Control event occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Grantee's right to receive payment at 50% of the Performance Shares awarded (as adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(b)) will become nonforfeitable.  The right to receive Shares in excess of 50% of the Performance Shares awarded (as adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(b)) will be forfeited.
 
 
 
 
(e) Notwithstanding Section 4(c), if Occidentals Total Shareholder Return does not exceed the Total Shareholder Return of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index (S&P 500 Index) for the same period, the Grantees right to receive Shares in excess of 50% of the Performance Shares awarded will be forfeited.  This comparison shall be calculated using Occidentals Total Shareholder Return as defined under Section 3, and by using the average of the closing S&P 500 Index value for the last ten trading days preceding July 1, 2012 and the average of the closing S&P 500 Index value for the last ten trading days preceding June 30, 2015 to calculate the Total Shareholder Return for the S&P 500 Index.
5.             The Performance Shares as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 7 of these Terms and Conditions will be settled in Shares only.  The Shares covered by these Terms and Conditions or any prorated portion thereof shall be issued to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the Committee's certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may be; but in any event, no later than the 15 day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
Payment of Awards
.
th
6.             With respect to the number of Performance Shares listed above, the Grantee will be credited on the books and records of Occidental with an amount (the Dividend Equivalent) equal to the amount per share of any cash dividends declared by the Board on the outstanding Shares as and when declared with a record date during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending with respect to any portion of the Performance Shares covered by these Terms and Conditions on the date on which the Committee certifies the attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may be, or, if earlier, the date on which the Grantee forfeits the right to receive such portion.  Occidental will pay in cash to the Grantee an amount equal to the Dividend Equivalents credited to such Grantee, adjusted, if appropriate, to reflect the same payment percentage that is used to determine the payment of the Performance Shares following certification of the attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may be, as promptly as may be practicable following such certification or Change in Control event, but, in any event, no later than the 15 day of the third month following the end of the first taxable year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
Crediting and Payment of Dividend Equivalents
.
th
7.             (a) The number of Performance Shares or kind of shares of stock covered by these Terms and Conditions shall be adjusted as the Committee determines pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Plan in order to prevent dilution or expansion of the Grantee's rights under these Terms and Conditions as a result of events such as stock dividends, stock splits or other changes in the capital structure of Occidental, or any merger, consolidation, spin-off, liquidation or other corporate transaction having a similar effect.  If any such adjustment occurs, the Company will give the Grantee written notice of the adjustment.
Adjustments
.
 
(b) In addition, the Committee may adjust the Performance Goal or other features of this Grant as permitted by Section 5.2.3 of the Plan.
8.             Nothing in these Terms and Conditions confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Grantee.  Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of the Company, the Grantees employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the Company.
No Employment Contract
.
 
 
 
 
9.             Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantees participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (Tax-Related Items), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantees responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award, including the grant or vesting of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award and the receipt of Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantees liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Taxes and Withholding
.
Prior to the relevant taxable event, the Grantee shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Grantee (A) in connection with the issuance of any Shares or any other consideration pursuant to this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award (other than the payment of Dividend Equivalents), from any Shares or cash that are to be issued or paid to the Grantee pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, in any combination as determined by the Committee at the time of Certification, or (B) in connection with the granting of Performance Shares or the payment of Dividend Equivalents pursuant to this grant of Performance Shares, from the Grantees wages or other cash compensation (including Dividend Equivalents).  The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantees receipt of this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
10.             The Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal, state and non-U.S. securities laws; however, the Company will not issue any Shares or other securities pursuant to these Terms and Conditions if their issuance would result in a violation of any such law.  However, if it is not feasible for the Company to comply with such laws with respect to the grant or settlement of these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any compensation or additional benefits provided to Grantee as a result of the cancellation.
Compliance with Law
.
11.             The benefits received by the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company, including the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company.  Additionally, the Performance Shares are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service awards.  This grant of Performance Shares does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Shares, or benefits in lieu of Performance Shares, even if Grantee has a history of receiving Performance Shares or other stock or cash awards.
Relation to Other Benefits
.
 
 
 
 
12.             The Plan may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Board at any time, as provided in the Plan.  Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an amendment to these Terms and Conditions to the extent it is applicable to these Terms and Conditions; however, no amendment will adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions without the Grantee's consent.
Amendments
.
13.             If one or more of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions is invalidated for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidated provisions shall be deemed to be separable from the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions will continue to be valid and fully enforceable.

14.             Except as specifically provided in this Section, these Terms and Conditions, the Exhibit and the Attachments incorporated in these Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the Company and the Grantee with respect to this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award.  These Terms and Conditions are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.  In the event of any inconsistent provisions between these Terms and Conditions and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan control.  Capitalized terms used in these Terms and Conditions without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.

Imposition of Other Requirements.  
22.

Consistent with Section 162(m), if at any time during the Performance Period, a Peer Company is acquired, ceases to exist, ceases to be a publicly-traded company at any time during the Performance Period, files for bankruptcy, spins off 25 percent or more of its assets, or sells all, or substantially all, of its assets, such company shall be removed and treated as if it had never been a Peer Company.  The remaining Peer Companies shall be ranked from first to last and the payout percentage for the award shall be determined under the above schedule based on the Company's ranking among the remaining Peer Companies, provided, that (1) the Committee may use its negative discretion to reduce the payout percentage associated with the Company's ranking, and (2) if the Company ranks last among the remaining Peer Companies, the payout percentage shall be 0%.
 
 
 
 
Attachment 1
 
A.           Except as otherwise required by law or legal process, the Grantee will not publish or divulge to any person, firm, corporation or institution and will not use to the detriment of Occidental, or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders (collectively, Occidental Parties), at any time during or after the Grantees employment by any of them, any trade secrets or confidential information of any of them (whether generated by them or as a result of any of their business relationships), including such information as described in Occidentals Code of Business Conduct and other corporate policies, without first obtaining the written permission of an officer of the Company.
 
B.           At the time of leaving employment with the Company, the Grantee will deliver to the Company, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all credit cards, drawings, blueprints, specifications, devices, notes, notebooks, memoranda, reports, studies, correspondence and other documents, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the Occidental Parties (whether generated by them or as a result of their business relationships), including any copies (whether in paper or electronic form), that the Grantee has in the Grantees possession or control.
 
C.           The Grantee will, during the Grantees employment by the Company, comply with the provisions of Occidentals Code of Business Conduct.
 
D.           Except as otherwise required by the Grantees job or permitted by law, the Grantee will not make statements about any Occidental Parties (1) to the press, electronic media, to any part of the investment community, to the public, or to any person connected with, employed by or having a relationship with any of them without permission of an officer of the Company or (2) that are derogatory, defamatory or negative.  Nothing herein, however, shall prevent Grantee from making a good faith report or complaint to appropriate governmental authorities.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantee will not interfere with or disrupt any of the Companys operations or otherwise take actions intended directly to harm any of the Occidental Parties.
 
E.           All inventions, developments, designs, improvements, discoveries and ideas that the Grantee makes or conceives in the course of employment by the Company, whether or not during regular working hours, relating to any design, article of manufacture, machine, apparatus, process, method, composition of matter, product or any improvement or component thereof, that are manufactured, sold, leased, used or under development by, or pertain to the present or possible future business of the Company shall be a work-for-hire and become and remain the property of Occidental, its successors and assigns.
 
The provisions of this Section do not apply to an invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides in substance that provisions in an employment agreement providing that an employee shall assign or offer to assign rights in an invention to his or her employer do not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employees own time, except for those inventions that either (a) relate, at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention, (1) to the business of the employer or (2) to the employers actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.
 
 
 
 
 
F.           The foregoing General Terms of Employment are not intended to be an exclusive list of the employment terms and conditions that apply to the Grantee.  The Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time amend or supplement the foregoing terms.  The Grantees breach of the foregoing General Terms of Employment will entitle the Company to take appropriate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, reduction of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award granted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and termination of employment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attachment 2
A
ny dispute arising out of or in any way related to the Grantees employment with the Company, or the termination of that employment, will be decided exclusively by final and binding arbitration pursuant to any procedures required by applicable law.  To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, any arbitration will be submitted to American Arbitration Association (AAA) and subject to AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration.  Only the following claims are excluded from these Terms and Conditions: (1) claims for workers compensation, unemployment compensation, or state disability benefits, and claims based upon any pension or welfare benefit plan the terms of which contain an arbitration or other non-judicial dispute resolution procedure, (2) to the extent permitted by applicable law, claims for provisional remedies to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of arbitration, (3) claims based on compensation award agreements and incentive plans and (4) claims which are not permitted by applicable law to be subject to a binding pre-dispute arbitration agreement.
Any controversy regarding whether a particular dispute is subject to arbitration under this Section shall be decided by the arbitrator.
To the extent required under applicable law, the Grantees responsibility for payment of the neutral arbitrators fees and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be required for a state trial court action and the Company shall pay all remaining fees and expenses of the arbitrator.  Unless otherwise required under applicable law, the parties shall each pay their pro rata share of the neutral arbitrator's expenses and fees.  Any controversy regarding the payment of fees and expenses under this arbitration provision shall be decided by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator may award any form of remedy or relief (including injunctive relief) that would otherwise be available in court.  Any award pursuant to said arbitration shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrator setting forth the reason for the award.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered, and enforcement may be sought in, any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws, the arbitrator will have the authority to hear and grant motions.
 

EXHIBIT 10.3
The following (these Terms and Conditions) are set forth as of the Date of Grant between OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (Occidental and, with its subsidiaries, the Company), and the Eligible Employee receiving this award (the Grantee).
Terms and Conditions
1.             In accordance with these Terms and Conditions and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the Plan), Occidental grants to the Grantee as of the Date of Grant, the number of shares of Restricted Stock set forth above. The Restricted Stock shall be fully paid and nonassessable and shall be represented by a book-entry account registered in the name of the Grantee with Occidentals registrar and stock transfer agent that will be subject to the restrictions hereinafter set forth until those shares have become transferable in accordance with Section 2.
Grant of Restricted Stock Incentive Award.
2.             (a) Until the Vesting Date and the certification by the Committee of the attainment on or after June 30, 2015 of the Performance Goal, the shares of Restricted Stock may not be transferred, assigned, sold, pledged, exchanged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Grantee, except to Occidental or pursuant to a domestic relations order, if applicable, (if approved or ratified by the Committee); provided that the Grantee may designate from time to time a beneficiary or beneficiaries on a form approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law).  If the Grantee dies without a beneficiary designation on file with Occidental at the time of death, the Grantees interest in the Restricted Stock will be transferred by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Restrictions on Transfer
.
(b) Further, if the Grantee was a Named Executive Officer during the last completed fiscal year prior to vesting,then such Grantee shall retain Beneficial Ownership of Shares equal to not less than 50% of the net after-tax Shares received under these Terms and Conditions until the third anniversary date of the vesting of the Restricted Stock under this Award (the Beneficial Ownership Period). Compliance with the foregoing requirement shall be determined by reference to the reports filed by the Grantee on Forms 3, 4, and 5, as applicable, pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and the aggregate number of Shares reported as Beneficially Owned during the Beneficial Ownership Period shall be not less than the sum of the number of Shares then required to be so owned pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions of any other grant containing this or
 
 
 
 
 
 
a similar requirement.  For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, Beneficial Ownership has the meaning ascribed in Rule 16a-1(2) under the Exchange Act, and Named Executive Officer has the meaning ascribed thereto pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.
3.           In order for the Grantee to retain the Restricted Stock, the Company must achieve cumulative reported Net Income (as defined in the Plan) of ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000.00), during the period beginning July 1, 2012 and ending June 30, 2019.  Reported Net Income shall be cumulative and shall be the sum of the net income and net losses reported in Occidentals Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Committee may certify attainment of the Performance Goal effective at any time on or after the Vesting Date (the Certification Date).
Performance Goal
.  
4.           a) If the Grantee fails to accept this award prior to the next record date for the payment of dividends on the Common Stock subsequent to the Date of Grant, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this award, the Grantee shall forfeit the shares of Restricted Stock and all rights under this award and this award will become null and void.  For purposes of this section, acceptance of the award shall occur on the date the Grantee accepts this Restricted Stock Incentive Award through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Benefit Access or any replacement on-line system designated by the Company.
Vesting and Forfeiture of Restricted Stock Incentive Award.  
(
(b) The Grantee must remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the Vesting Date.  The continuous employment of the Grantee will not be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the Grantees employment among the Company and its affiliates or an approved leave of absence.  However, if, prior to the Vesting Date, the Grantee dies, becomes permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and terminates employment as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the Company (each of the foregoing, a Forfeiture Event), then the number of shares of Restricted Stock will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining until the Vesting Date following the date of the Forfeiture Event.  If the Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for cause before the Vesting Date, then these Terms and Conditions will terminate automatically on the date of the Grantees termination and the Grantee shall forfeit the Restricted Stock.
(c)           If a Change in Control event occurs prior to the Vesting Date, the number of shares of Restricted Stock will be reduced on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days remaining until the Vesting Date following the date of the Change in Control and become nonforfeitable unless, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control event, the Committee, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, determines that such event will not accelerate vesting of any of these Restricted Stock.  Any such determination by the Committee is binding on the Grantee.
 
 
 
 
(d)           If a Change in Control event occurs on or after the Vesting Date but prior to the Certification Date, the shares of Restricted Stock will become nonforfeitable unless, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control event, the Committee, as provided in Section 7.1 of the Plan, determines that such event will not accelerate vesting of any of these Restricted Stock.  Any such determination by the Committee is binding on the Grantee.
(e)           Notwithstanding Section 4(b), if the Company does not meet the Performance Goal on or before June 30, 2019 the Grantee or any permitted assignee will forfeit the Restricted Stock.  If the Company meets the Performance Goal on or before June 30, 2019, the Restricted Stock (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(b)), will become nonforfeitable on the Certification Date.
5.            Except as otherwise provided herein, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such shares and receive any dividends that may be paid thereon; provided, however, that any additional shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Grantee may become entitled to receive pursuant to a stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, separation or reorganization or any other change in the capital structure of Occidental shall be subject to the same restrictions as the shares of Restricted Stock.
Dividend, Voting and Other Rights.
 
6.             Nothing in these Terms and Conditions confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of the Grantee.  Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of the Company, the Grantees employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the Company.
No Employment Contract
.
7.             Regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantees participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (Tax-Related Items), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantees responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the Company (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of this Restricted Stock Incentive Award, including the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Incentive Award and the receipt of dividends; and (ii) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Incentive Award to reduce or eliminate the Grantees liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Grantee
Taxes and Withholding
.
 
 
 
 
 
 
acknowledges that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable event, the Grantee shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Grantee first from the shares pursuant to this Restricted Stock Incentive Award and, if not sufficient, from the Grantees wages or other cash compensation.  The Grantee shall pay to the Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be required to withhold as a result of the Grantees receipt of this Restricted Stock Incentive Award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
Notwithstanding its availability, the Grantee expressly agrees not to make an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.
8.             The Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with all federal, state and non-U.S. laws applicable to awards of this type.  However, if it is not feasible for the Company to comply with these laws with respect to the grant or settlement of these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any compensation or additional benefits provided to Grantee as a result of the cancellation.
Compliance with Law
.
9.             The benefits received by the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company, including the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company.  Additionally, this Restricted Stock Incentive Award is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service awards.  The grant of this Restricted Stock Incentive Award does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock Incentive Awards or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Incentive Awards, even if Grantee has a history of receiving Restricted Stock Incentive Awards or other cash or stock awards.

A.           Except as otherwise required by law or legal process, the Grantee will not publish or divulge to any person, firm, corporation or institution and will not use to the detriment of Occidental, or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or stockholders (collectively, Occidental Parties), at any time during or after the Grantees employment by any of them, any trade secrets or confidential information of any of them (whether generated by them or as a result of any of their business relationships), including such information as described in Occidentals Code of Business Conduct and other corporate policies, without first obtaining the written permission of an officer of the Company.
 
B.           At the time of leaving employment with the Company, the Grantee will deliver to the Company, and not keep or deliver to anyone else, any and all credit cards, drawings, blueprints, specifications, devices, notes, notebooks, memoranda, reports, studies, correspondence and other documents, and, in general, any and all materials relating to the Occidental Parties (whether generated by them or as a result of their business relationships), including any copies (whether in paper or electronic form), that the Grantee has in the Grantees possession or control.
 
C.           The Grantee will, during the Grantees employment by the Company, comply with the provisions of Occidentals Code of Business Conduct.

Nothing herein, however, shall prevent Grantee from making a good faith report or complaint to appropriate governmental authorities.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantee will not interfere with or disrupt any of the Companys operations or otherwise take actions intended directly to harm any of the Occidental Parties.
 
E.

The provisions of this Section do not apply to an invention that qualifies fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides in
 
 
 
 
 
substance that provisions in an employment agreement providing that an employee shall assign or offer to assign rights in an invention to his or her employer do not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the employer was used and which was developed entirely on the employees own time, except for those inventions that either (a) relate, at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention, (1) to the business of the employer or (2) to the employers actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (b) result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.
 
F.           The foregoing General Terms of Employment are not intended to be an exclusive list of the employment terms and conditions that apply to the Grantee.  The Company, in its sole discretion, may at any time amend or supplement the foregoing terms.  The Grantees breach of the foregoing General Terms of Employment will entitle the Company to take appropriate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, reduction of the Restricted Stock Incentive Award granted pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and termination of employment.
 
 
 
 
 
A
ny dispute arising out of or in any way related to the Grantees employment with the Company, or the termination of that employment, will be decided exclusively by final and binding arbitration pursuant to any procedures required by applicable law.

To the extent required under applicable law, the Grantees responsibility for payment of the neutral arbitrators fees and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be required for a state trial court action and the Company shall pay all remaining fees and expenses of the arbitrator.  Unless otherwise required under applicable law, the parties shall each pay their pro rata share of the neutral arbitrator's expenses and fees.  Any controversy regarding the payment of fees and expenses under this arbitration provision shall be decided by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator may award any form of remedy or relief (including injunctive relief) that would otherwise be available in court.  Any award pursuant to said arbitration shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrator setting forth the reason for the award.  The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, and judgment upon the award may be entered, and enforcement may be sought in, any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws, the arbitrator will have the authority to hear and grant motions.
