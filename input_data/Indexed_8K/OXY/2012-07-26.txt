Item 8.01.
Other Events
On July 26, 2012, Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced net income of $1.3 billion ($1.64 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2012, compared with the second quarter of 2011 net income of $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share).
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.0 billion for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $2.6 billion for the second quarter of 2011.  Lower oil and gas prices, higher operating costs and higher DD&A rates in the second quarter of 2012 were partially offset by higher volumes.
For the second quarter of 2012, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 766,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 715,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2011.
The second quarter 2012 production increase resulted from 38,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes and a 13,000 BOE per day increase in the Middle East/North Africa.
Daily sales volumes increased from 705,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2011 to 759,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2012.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $99.34 per barrel for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $103.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2011. The second quarter of 2012 realized oil price represents 106 percent of the average WTI and 91 percent of the average Brent price for the quarter. Worldwide NGL prices were $42.06 per barrel in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $57.67 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. Domestic gas prices decreased 51 percent from $4.27 per MCF in the second quarter of 2011 to $2.09 per MCF for the second quarter of 2012.
Second quarter 2012 realized prices were also lower than first quarter 2012 prices for all our products.  On a sequential quarterly basis, price decreases were 8 percent for worldwide crude oil, 20 percent for worldwide NGLs and 26 percent for domestic natural gas.

Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $194 million, compared with $253 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The year-over-year decrease was the result of lower domestic and export caustic volumes, lower vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) export demand, and lower polyvinyl chloride and VCM export prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and ethylene costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $187 million for the second quarter of 2011. The results predominantly reflect lower margins in the marketing and trading businesses and the gas processing businesses, partially offset by higher income in the pipeline businesses.
Year-to-date 2012 core income was $2.9 billion ($3.56 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.19 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011.  Net income for the first six months of 2012 was $2.9 billion ($3.55 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.13 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011.
Oil and gas segment earnings were $4.5 billion for the six months of 2012, compared with $5.1 billion for the same period of 2011.  The $600 million decrease in the 2012 results reflected lower NGL and natural gas prices, higher operating costs and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by higher oil prices and increased volumes.
Oil and gas production volumes for the six months were 760,000 BOE per day for 2012, compared with 723,000 BOE per day for the 2011 period.  Year-over-year, our domestic production increased by 11 percent, while total production increased by 5 percent.  Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production-sharing and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa and Long Beach production by 7,000 BOE per day.
The six-month 2012 daily production volume increase resulted from 44,000 BOE higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes of 2,000 BOE in the Middle East/North Africa and 5,000 BOE in Latin America.
Daily sales volumes were 752,000 BOE in the first six months of 2012, compared with 717,000 BOE for 2011.
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil but declined for natural gas and NGLs on a year-over-year basis.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $103.63 per barrel for the six months of 2012, compared with $97.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011.  Worldwide NGL prices were $47.52 per barrel for the six months of 2012, compared with $55.38 per barrel in the six months of 2011.  Domestic gas prices declined 42 percent, from $4.24 per MCF in the six months of 2011 to $2.46 per MCF in the six months of 2012.

Chemical segment earnings were $378 million for the six months of 2012, compared with $472 million for the same period in 2011.  The 2012 six-month reduction was primarily a result of lower export volumes and prices due to the weakening economic conditions in Europe and Asia, partially offset by lower energy costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $208 million for the six months of 2012, compared with $301 million for the same period in 2011.  The 2012 results reflect lower results in the marketing and trading business, the gas processing business and the power generation business, partially offset by improved results in the pipeline businesses.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release: July 26, 2012
LOS ANGELES, July 26, 2012 -- (NYSE:OXY) announced net income of $1.3 billion ($1.64 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2012, compared with the second quarter of 2011 net income of $1.8 billion ($2.23 per diluted share).
Occidental Petroleum Corporation
In announcing the results, Stephen I. Chazen, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our second quarter 2012 total Company production of 766,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was the second consecutive quarter of record production.  Our domestic production was 9 percent higher than the second quarter of 2011 and total production was 7 percent higher.  Our domestic production of 462,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was a record for the seventh consecutive quarter.  We increased our daily domestic production by 7,000 barrels from the first quarter of 2012 and by 38,000 barrels from the second quarter of 2011.
"Lower product prices impacted our second quarter results, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.64 per share.  We generated cash flow from operations of $6.0 billion for the first six months of 2012 and invested $5.1 billion in capital expenditures."
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $2.0 billion for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $2.6 billion for the second quarter of 2011.  Lower oil and gas prices, higher operating costs and higher DD&A rates in the second quarter of 2012 were partially offset by higher volumes.
For the second quarter of 2012, daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 766,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 715,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2011.
The second quarter 2012 production increase resulted from 38,000 BOE per day higher domestic volumes and a 13,000 BOE per day increase in the Middle East/North Africa.
 
 
 
 
 
Daily sales volumes increased from 705,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2011 to 759,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2012.
Oxys realized price for worldwide crude oil was $99.34 per barrel for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $103.12 per barrel for the second quarter of 2011. The second quarter of 2012 realized oil price represents 106 percent of the average WTI and 91 percent of the average Brent price for the quarter. Worldwide NGL prices were $42.06 per barrel in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $57.67 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011. Domestic gas prices decreased 51 percent from $4.27 per MCF in the second quarter of 2011 to $2.09 per MCF for the second quarter of 2012.
Second quarter 2012 realized prices were also lower than first quarter 2012 prices for all our products.  On a sequential quarterly basis, price decreases were 8 percent for worldwide crude oil, 20 percent for worldwide NGLs and 26 percent for domestic natural gas.
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $194 million, compared with $253 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The year-over-year decrease was the result of lower domestic and export caustic volumes, lower vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) export demand, and lower polyvinyl chloride and VCM export prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and ethylene costs.
 
 
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared with $187 million for the second quarter of 2011. The results predominantly reflect lower margins in the marketing and trading businesses and the gas processing businesses, partially offset by higher income in the pipeline businesses.
 
 
Year-to-date 2012 core income was $2.9 billion ($3.56 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.19 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011.  Net income for the first six months of 2012 was $2.9 billion ($3.55 per diluted share), compared with $3.4 billion ($4.13 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011.
 
 
Oil and gas segment earnings were $4.5 billion for the six months of 2012, compared with $5.1 billion for the same period of 2011.  The $600 million decrease in the 2012 results reflected lower NGL and natural gas prices, higher operating costs and higher DD&A rates, partially offset by higher oil prices and increased volumes.
Oil and gas production volumes for the six months were 760,000 BOE per day for 2012, compared with 723,000 BOE per day for the 2011 period.  Year-over-year, our domestic production increased by 11 percent, while total production increased by 5 percent.  Higher year-over-year average oil prices and other factors affecting our production-sharing
 
 
 
 
 
and similar contracts lowered our Middle East/North Africa and Long Beach production by 7,000 BOE per day.
The six-month 2012 daily production volume increase resulted from 44,000 BOE higher domestic volumes, partially offset by lower volumes of 2,000 BOE in the Middle East/North Africa and 5,000 BOE in Latin America.
Daily sales volumes were 752,000 BOE in the first six months of 2012, compared with 717,000 BOE for 2011.
Oxy's realized prices improved for crude oil but declined for natural gas and NGLs on a year-over-year basis.  Worldwide crude oil prices were $103.63 per barrel for the six months of 2012, compared with $97.38 per barrel for the six months of 2011.  Worldwide NGL prices were $47.52 per barrel for the six months of 2012, compared with $55.38 per barrel in the six months of 2011.  Domestic gas prices declined 42 percent, from $4.24 per MCF in the six months of 2011 to $2.46 per MCF in the six months of 2012.
Chemicals
Chemical segment earnings were $378 million for the six months of 2012, compared with $472 million for the same period in 2011.  The 2012 six-month reduction was primarily a result of lower export volumes and prices due to the weakening economic conditions in Europe and Asia, partially offset by lower energy costs.
Midstream, Marketing and Other
Midstream segment earnings were $208 million for the six months of 2012, compared with $301 million for the same period in 2011.  The 2012 results reflect lower results in the marketing and trading business, the gas processing business and the power generation business, partially offset by improved results in the pipeline businesses.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Thank you Chris.
Net income was $1.3 billion or $1.64 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $1.8 billion or $2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011 and $1.6 billion or $1.92 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
All of the drop in the second quarter earnings compared to the first quarter of 2012 was attributable to the decline in commodity prices.  Worldwide oil and domestic gas and NGL prices were significantly lower during the quarter.
Heres the segment breakdown for the
second quarter.
Oil and gas segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $2.0 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
In the oil and gas segment, the second quarter 2012 daily production was 766,000 barrels, the highest volume in the Company's history for the
 
 
 
 
 
second consecutive quarter, and was up 7 percent from the same period of 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $194 million, compared to $184 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $253 million for the second quarter of 2011.  The sequential quarterly improvement was due to improved polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) margins driven primarily by lower ethylene costs.  The year-over-year decrease was the result of lower domestic and export caustic volumes, lower VCM export demand, and lower PVC and VCM export prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and ethylene costs.
Midstream segment earnings were $77 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $131 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The decline in earnings was mostly in the marketing and trading businesses and to a lesser degree in the gas plants, reflecting lower NGL prices, partially offset by improvements in the pipeline businesses.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 40 percent for the second quarter of 2012.  Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules.
for the first six months of 2012 was $6.0 billion.  We used $5.1 billion of the companys total cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.0 billion for acquisitions.  Financial activities, which included dividends paid, stock buybacks and a $1.75 billion borrowing during the quarter, provided a net $800 million of cash flow.
Cash flow from operations
 
 
 
 
 
These and other net cash flows resulted in a $4.4 billion cash balance at June 30.
for the first six months of 2012 were $5.1 billion, of which $2.7 billion was spent in the second quarter.  Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 82 percent in oil and gas, 15 percent in midstream and the remainder in chemicals.  The Al Hosn Shah gas project made up about 11 percent of the total capital spending for the first six months of 2012.
Capital expenditures
Our for the first six months of 2012 were $1.0 billion, mostly consisting of bolt-on acquisitions in the Williston basin, South Texas and the Permian.
acquisitions
The weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the first six months of 2012 were 810.4 million and the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding were 811.2 million.  Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 810.0 million.
Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16 percent.  At the end of the second quarter, we issued $1.75 billion of senior notes at a weighted average interest rate of 2.4 percent, which brought the Companys average effective borrowing rate down to 3.0 percent.
Copies of the press release announcing our second quarter earnings and the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SECs EDGAR system.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to provide guidance for the second half of the year.

Thank you Jim.
Occidentals second quarter 2012 production set an all-time record for the Company for the second consecutive quarter and the domestic oil and gas segment produced record volumes for the seventh consecutive quarter.  The second quarter domestic production of 462,000 barrel equivalents per day, consisting of 322,000 barrels of liquids and 840 million cubic feet per day of gas, was an increase of 7,000 barrel equivalents per day compared to the first quarter of 2012.  About 86 percent of the domestic production growth over first quarter 2012 was in liquids, which grew from 316,000 barrels a day to 322,000.  Compared to the second quarter of 2011, our domestic production grew by 9 percent, or 38,000 barrels a day, of which 25,000 barrels per day was liquids production growth and 79 million cubic feet per day was gas.
Our annualized return on equity for the first six months of 2012 was 15 percent and return on capital employed was 13 percent.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital Program
We are raising our estimate of the total year capital program to $9.2 billion, from our previously announced level of $8.3 billion.  Of the increase, about $600 million is for the Al Hosn Shah gas project, with the remainder of the increase going to the rest of the Oil and Gas segment, primarily to non-operated properties where our forecasting ability is limited.  We expect our capital spend rate to slow down modestly from the current levels during the back half of the year and stabilize in the fourth quarter.
The Al Hosn Shah gas project is approximately 49 percent complete and is progressing as planned. This project made up about 11 percent of our total capital program for the first six months of 2012.  With spending continuing at current levels, we are increasing our anticipated spending in the remainder of 2012 as I just mentioned.  However, total development capital for the project is expected to be in line with previous estimates.
In our domestic operations, we expect the total average rig count at current levels of about 75 to go down to an average of 70 by the end of the year.  However, the mix of the rigs will shift among different regions related to changes in gas and NGL prices.
With our production growth wedge firmly in place for the back half of the year, we will focus our efforts on improving our profitability.  This includes increased oil program rather than drilling gas/NGL wells.  We are releasing and will continue to release underperforming rigs and crews.  We will also work on improving our operating costs.  These things are well within our ability to achieve.  We expect to do more with less money in the rest of the year.
In California, we are continuing to see improvement with respect to permitting issues relative to last year.  We have received approved field rules
 
 
 
 
and new permits for both injection wells and drilling locations.  The regulatory agency continues to be responsive and committed to working through the backlog of permits.
The new Elk Hills gas plant, which went into operation in early July, will posity affect our operational efficiency and production in the back half of the year.

So to summarize:
 
 
 
 
 
Now we're ready to take your questions.
