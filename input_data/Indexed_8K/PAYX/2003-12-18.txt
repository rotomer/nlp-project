ROCHESTER, NY, December 18, 2003  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $80.7 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended November 30, 2003, an increase of 8% over net income of $74.7 million, or $.20 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $312.1 million, a 16% increase over $268.8 million for the second quarter last year.
For the six months ended November 30, 2003, the Company reported net income of $161.0 million, or $.42 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 7% over net income of $150.6 million, or $.40 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $621.4 million, an increase of 19% over $521.5 million for the same period last year.
In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay") on April 1, 2003. The Company's results of operations for the first six months of fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period. The results for the prior year six-month period include the results of Advantage from the date of acquisition.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended November 30, 2003, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $297.6 million, an increase of 16% over $255.7 million for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended November 30, 2003, service revenues were $593.5 million, an increase of 20% over $495.1 million for the same period last year. The Company estimates that organic service revenue growth was in the range of 11% to 12% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004.
Payroll service revenue increased 16% for the second quarter and 20% for the six-month period to $255.0 million and $509.7 million, respectively. The year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 were comparable with the prior year periods.
As of November 30, 2003, 88% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 61% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 39% and 41% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $33.1 million and $64.7 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 19% for the second quarter and 21% for the six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $42.5 million and $83.8 million, respectively. The increases are related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 18% and 17% in the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $19.3 million and $37.2 million, respectively.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the second quarter and 6% for the six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $14.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively. The increases in interest on funds held for clients are attributable to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by
 
lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. Higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and by the growth in the utilization of the Company's tax filing and payment services and employee payment services. Average portfolio balances for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 were $2.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter and six-month period. The average interest rate earned on the funds held for clients portfolio was 1.8% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with 2.5% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $4.4 million and $7.1 million for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $.6 million and $2.3 million for the respective prior year periods.
OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 16% in the second quarter and 22% for the six-month period over the prior year periods. The increases are due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. As a result of the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.2 million and $8.3 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, from $2.2 million and $2.8 million in the respective prior year periods. Operating income increased 16% and 14% in the second quarter and six-month period to $114.8 million and $229.9 million, respectively.
Operating income growth continues to be negatively impacted by the lower average interest rates earned on funds held for clients. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 17% and 15% in the second quarter and six-month period to $100.3 million and $202.0 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% in the second quarter and six-month period, compared with 34% and 35% in the respective prior year periods.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 56% for the second quarter and 54% for the six-month period to $5.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The decreases are due to lower average portfolio balances resulting from the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions, lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $415 million and $400 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with average balances of $512 million and $631 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.5% and 2.7% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with 3.4% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $2.7 million and $4.2 million for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $7.2 million and $9.6 million for the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rates were 32.7% and 32.6% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with 32.5% and 32.0% for the respective prior year periods. The increases in the effective tax rates are the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which were in line with our expectations. We are hopeful that signs of improving small business conditions will continue. We remain focused on growing our client base and the integration of the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of 15% to 17%, accompanied by net income growth in the high single digits. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."
