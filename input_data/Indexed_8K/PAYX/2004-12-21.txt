FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, December 21, 2004  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $86.9 million, or $.23 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter ended November 30, 2004, an increase of 8% over net income of $80.7 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $347.3 million, an 11% increase over $312.1 million for the second quarter last year.
For the six months ended November 30, 2004, the Company reported net income of $174.6 million, or $.46 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 8% over net income of $161.0 million, or $.42 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $692.3 million, an increase of 11% over $621.4 million for the same period last year.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the second quarter ended November 30, 2004, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $334.9 million, an increase of 13% over $297.6 million for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended November 30, 2004, service revenues were $669.1 million, an increase of 13% over $593.5 million for the same period last year.
Payroll service revenue increased 9% in the second quarter and 10% in the six-month period to $278.7 million and $559.1 million, respectively. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. As of November 30, 2004, 90% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 64% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 28% and 29% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $42.5 million and $83.5 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 32% for the second quarter and 31% for the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $56.2 million and $110.0 million, respectively. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance products. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $22.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 42% in the second quarter and 45% in the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $16.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 15% for the second quarter and 17% for the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $12.4 million and $23.2 million, respectively, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decreases are attributable to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth. Average portfolio balances for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 were $2.4 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in both the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.8% for the respective periods of fiscal 2004. There were no net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and $.2 million for the six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $4.4 million and $7.1 million for the respective prior year periods.
 
CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% in both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 over the prior year periods. The increases are due to increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs to support the organic growth of the Company. Higher professional services expenses related to pending legal matters also contributed to the increases in consolidated expenses for both the second quarter and six-month period.
Operating income increased 11% in both the second quarter and six-month period to $126.9 million and $255.6 million, respectively. Operating income growth continues to be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates earned and realized gain comparisons in the funds held for clients investment portfolio. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 14% and 15% year-over-year in the second quarter and six-month period to $114.5 million and $232.4 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% for the second quarter and 35% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 34% for both the respective prior year periods.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 46% for the second quarter and 44% for the six-month period to $2.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decreases are due to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $557 million and $544 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with average balances of $415 million and $400 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.5% and 2.7% in the respective prior year periods. There were no net realized gains included in investment income in the second quarter or six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with $2.7 million and $4.2 million in the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rates were 33.0% for both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the respective prior year periods.
Jonathan J. Judge, president and chief executive officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, which were in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and improving our profit margins. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, accompanied by net income growth in the range of 16% to 18%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income, excluding interest on funds held for clients, expense charges in fiscal 2004 for pending legal matters, and the net incremental PEO revenue benefit recognized in fiscal 2004, will approximate 15%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."
