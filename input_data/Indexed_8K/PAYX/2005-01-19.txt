ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On January 14, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved a proposal to suspend any further contributions to the Paychex, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") by Plan participants, effective immediately. The Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of highly compensated and/or management employees of Paychex, Inc. and its subsidiaries that provides these employees with the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus. The Plan also allows non-employee Directors to defer up to 100% of their Board compensation.
     The Board also approved the creation of two new non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which will be effective as of January 1, 2005. The Paychex, Inc. Employee Deferred Compensation Plan will allow certain highly compensated and/or management employees of Paychex, Inc. and its subsidiaries to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus. The Paychex, Inc. Board Deferred Compensation Plan will allow non-employee Directors to defer up to 100% of their Board compensation. The new plans will incorporate provisions required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
