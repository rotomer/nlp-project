ROCHESTER, NY, March 21, 2005  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $92.8 million, or $.24 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended February 28, 2005, an increase of 15% over net income of $80.5 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, from the prior year third quarter. Total revenues for the three months ended February 28, 2005 were $373.9 million, a 9% increase over $342.6 million from the prior year third quarter.
For the nine months ended February 28, 2005, the Company reported net income of $267.4 million, or $.70 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 11% over net income of $241.5 million, or $.64 diluted earnings per share, from the same period last year. Total revenues were $1,066.1 million, an increase of 11% over $964.0 million from the same period last year.
"We have, once again, experienced record financial results for the quarter and for the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Our financial results remain in line with our expectations," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our focus continues to be on growth in our client base - both through adding new clients and selling our ancillary services into the base. We were also pleased to see our first significant increase in interest on funds held for clients since fiscal 2001. We expect the full year fiscal 2005 to be another year of record revenues and net income. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 is expected to be near the upper end of 9% to 11%, and we expect the total revenue growth to be accompanied by net income growth in the range of 17% to 19%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."
SERVICE REVENUES
For the three months ended February 28, 2005, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $357.1 million, an increase of 9% over $328.1 million from the prior year third quarter. For the nine months ended February 28, 2005, service revenues were $1,026.2 million, an increase of 11% over $921.6 million from the same period last year.
Payroll service revenue increased 8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 9% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $292.0 million and $851.0 million, respectively. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. The growth rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was impacted by one less calendar billing day than in the prior year third quarter. Due to one additional calendar billing day in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, there was no impact for the nine months of fiscal 2005 as compared to same period last year. As of February 28, 2005, 90% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 65% of all clients utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 25% and 27% for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 to $47.3 million and $130.8 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 13% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 24% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $65.1 million and $175.2 million, respectively. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance products.
Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 from the same periods last year to $24.0 million and $67.5 million, respectively. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 32% in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 40% in the nine months of fiscal 2005 from the same periods last year to $16.9 million and $49.4 million, respectively. PEO workers' compensation revenue was affected by refunds of PEO workers' compensation insurance premiums and reductions in the estimated claim loss exposure related
 
to prior year periods. Excluding total PEO revenue, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 25% and 28% for the three and nine month periods of fiscal 2005, respectively, from the same periods last year.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $16.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, but decreased 6% to $39.9 million for the nine months of fiscal 2005. The increase in interest on funds held for clients for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 is attributable to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth, partially offset by a decrease in net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities. The decrease in interest on funds held for clients for the nine months of fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances were $3.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $2.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion for the respective periods last year. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 2.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.6% and 1.8% for the respective periods last year. Included in interest on funds held for clients were $0.1 million net realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $0.1 million of net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities for the nine months of fiscal 2005. This compared with net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities of $3.5 million and $10.6 million for the respective periods last year.
CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 9% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 over the same periods last year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $9.2 million of expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters. Consolidated expenses, excluding the reserve for pending legal matters, increased by 10% and 11%, respectively, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005. These increases are primarily the result of increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs incurred to support organic growth, and the additional expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of Stromberg in April 2004.
Operating income increased 16% to $135.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 13% to $390.9 million in the nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, from the same periods last year. Operating income growth is impacted by fluctuations in interest rates earned and net realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients' investment portfolio.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 33% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $3.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. The decreases in fiscal 2005 are primarily attributable to lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average portfolio balances. The nine months of fiscal 2005 was also impacted by lower average interest rates earned. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $614 million and $567 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared with average portfolio balances of $466 million and $422 million in the respective periods last year. The average interest rate earned for the corporate investment portfolio was 2.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.2% and 2.5% in the respective periods last year. There were no net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $1.0 million and $5.2 million in the respective periods last year.
INCOME TAXES
The Company's effective income tax rates were 33.0% for both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the respective periods last year.
