     On or about March 6, 2006, Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") sent a notice to participants in the Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan") informing them that the 401(k) Plan would be changing its recordkeeper. This notice indicated that, as a result of the conversion, from a period beginning on April 25, 2006 and ending the week of May 8, 2006 (the "blackout period"), participants will not be able to direct or diversify investments or request a distribution from the 401(k) Plan. These restrictions apply to shares of the Company's common stock held in the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which is an investment option under the 401(k) Plan.

A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     During the blackout period and for a period of two years after the ending date thereof, a participant in the 401(k) Plan, a security holder, or other interested person may obtain, without charge, information regarding the blackout period, including the actual ending date of the blackout period, by contacting Stephanie Schaeffer, Chief Legal Officer, or John Morphy, Chief Financial Officer, at Paychex, Inc., 911 Panorama Trail South, Rochester, NY 14625-2396; Telephone (585) 385-6666.
