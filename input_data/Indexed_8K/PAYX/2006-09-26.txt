EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
September 26, 2006
First Quarter Fiscal 2007 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 26, 2006  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $135.1 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2006 (the "first quarter"), a 17% increase over net income of $115.0 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $459.4 million, a 14% increase over $403.7 million for the same period last year.
     "We continued our tradition of record financial results as demonstrated by a strong first quarter which provides a very good start to fiscal 2007. We entered the year knowing our first quarter comparisons would be difficult due to the exceptionally strong first quarter we experienced a year ago. I was pleased to see results better than we expected. Operating income margins excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs were higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "We continue to provide excellent results while remaining focused on investing for the long-term by improving our client service levels, offering new services, and increasing ancillary services penetration," remarked Mr. Judge. "Our performance metrics of client base growth, check volume, and new-hire reporting were very good for the quarter driving the 9% increase in payroll service revenue. We expect to meet our fiscal 2007 guidance that we provided last quarter."
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 21% to $92.0 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 13% to 39,000 clients; client employees for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 31% to 312,000 client employees; and workers' compensation services client base increased 19% to 54,000 clients. Additionally, the retirement services client employees' funds increased 21% to $6.6 billion.
     Total expenses increased 13% to $273.0 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. Additionally, we incurred $6.5 million of stock-based compensation costs for the first quarter. Total expense growth would have been 11% excluding stock-based compensation costs.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $186.4 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs increased 14% to $163.1 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 38% from 37% for the same period last year.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients increased 55% to $29.8 million and corporate investment income increased 94% to $9.4 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2007, is the same as provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2006, except for the inclusion of the effect of the Federal Funds rate increase on June 29, 2006. The Federal Funds rate increases directly effect interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income.
     Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.
