PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
December 20, 2006
SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 20, 2006  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $132.7 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended November 30, 2006 (the "second quarter"), an 18% increase over net income of $112.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenue was $454.9 million, a 14% increase over $399.8 million for the same period last year.
     "Fiscal 2007 continues to meet our expectations with another excellent quarter generating record financial results. We are particularly pleased with our growth in service revenue of slightly over 12%, driven by a stable economy and continued growth in our Human Resource Services revenue. Our operating income margins, excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs, were again higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the same period last year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 24% to $93.0 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 14% to 41,000 clients; client employees for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 31% to 328,000 client employees; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 18% to 56,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 25% to $7.2 billion.
     Total expenses increased 13% to $272.6 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. Additionally, we incurred $5.8 million of stock-based compensation costs for the second quarter. Total expense growth would have been 11% excluding stock-based compensation costs.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $182.3 million, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs increased 15% to $158.4 million and improved as a percent of service revenue to 37% from 36% for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 43% to $29.7 million and corporate investment income increased 79% to $9.9 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
