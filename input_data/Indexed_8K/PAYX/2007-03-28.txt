PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
March 28, 2007
THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 28, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $126.6 million, or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended February 28, 2007 (the "third quarter"), an 11% increase over net income of $114.5 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. The third quarter results were impacted by an increase to the litigation reserve of $13.0 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share for the third quarter by approximately $0.02 per share.
     "We have enjoyed another excellent quarter and look forward to our seventeenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our third quarter growth in operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and certain items was very strong at 18%."
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 25% to $102.2 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 15% to 43,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 30% to 350,000 client employees; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 16% to 59,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 24% to $7.6 billion.
     Total expenses increased 16% to $312.3 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. Expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by the increase to the litigation reserve. Additionally, we incurred $7.0 million of stock-based compensation costs for the third quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation costs and the increase to the litigation reserve, total expense growth would have been 8%.
     For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 31% to $37.7 million and corporate investment income increased 65% to $10.5 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
