EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
September 26, 2007
First Quarter Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 26, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $151.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2007 (the "first quarter"), a 12% increase over net income of $135.1 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenue was $507.1 million, a 10% increase over $459.4 million for the same period last year.
     "We continued our tradition of record financial results as demonstrated by an excellent first quarter, on track to achieve our eighteenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position have allowed us to continue to support our ongoing operations while returning value to our stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 43% and commenced a program to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities of our business. In the first quarter, we repurchased $396.5 million of our common stock for a total of 8.9 million shares and we expect to complete the stock repurchase program in 2007," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $361.5 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The increase was due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 20% to $113.3 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 18% to 45,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 22% to 381,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance client base increased 19% to 65,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 30% to $8.5 billion.
     Total expenses increased 9% to $296.5 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel related to selling to new clients, retaining clients, and promoting new services.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $210.6 million, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 14% to $178.3 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 38% from 36% for the same period last year.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $32.3 million and corporate investment income increased 30% to $12.2 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     In July 2007, we announced our program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of Paychex, Inc. common stock. Through September 26, 2007, we repurchased 11.2 million shares for a total of $500.0 million. Subject to changes in market conditions, we expect to complete our repurchase program in 2007 and anticipate that our weighted average outstanding shares for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") will be approximately 370 million.
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for fiscal 2008 has been revised from that provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") for the year ended May 31, 2007, incorporating the anticipated impact of lower investment income as a result of funding the stock repurchase program. In addition, this revised guidance reflects the 50 basis point decrease in the Federal Funds rate announced on September 18, 2007. Our anticipated effective income tax rate increased as a result of the lower expected tax-exempt income earned on our investment portfolios as well as the adoption of new accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32.5%.
