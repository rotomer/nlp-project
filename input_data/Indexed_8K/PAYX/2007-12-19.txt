SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 19, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $147.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2007 (the "second quarter"), an 11% increase over net income of $132.7 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, an increase of 14% over $0.35 per share for the same period last year. Total revenue was $507.8 million, a 12% increase over $455.0 million for the same period last year.
     "Fiscal 2008 continues to meet our expectations and we experienced excellent margins, with operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients improving 17% over the same period last year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our results for the second quarter were strong and included the acquisition of Hawthorne Benefit Technologies, Inc., whose BeneTrac, a web-based benefits management and administration system, contributed to the growth in Human Resource Services revenue.
     "We are also pleased to announce the completion of our $1.0 billion stock repurchase program on December 14, 2007, for a total of 23.7 million shares of common stock, with fiscal year 2008 weighted-average outstanding shares expected to be 370 million," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue increased 9% to $361.6 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The increase was due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 24% to $115.5 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 17% to 46,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 22% to 401,000 client employees served; and the workers' compensation insurance client base increased 19% to 67,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 24% to $8.9 billion.
     Total expenses increased 9% to $298.3 million for the second quarter from the same period last year as a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $209.5 million, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 17% to $178.7 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 37% from 36% for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 4% to $30.7 million attributable primarily to higher average investment balances. Corporate investment income decreased 25% to $7.5 million due to lower average investment balances resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program, offset by higher average interest rates earned.
 
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
