On October 6, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") approved two new non-qualified deferred compensation plans, effective as of January 1, 2005. In January 2005, the Board had suspended any further contributions to the existing plans at the time. The Paychex, Inc. Employee Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2005, allows certain highly compensated and/or management employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus. The Paychex, Inc. Board Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2005, allows non-employee Directors to defer up to 100% of their Board compensation. The new plans incorporate provisions required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
The following exhibits relating to Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K are furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.1
     1.01 . The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain members of management and highly compensated employees of the Company with an opportunity to elect to defer the receipt of a portion of their Eligible Compensation.
Purpose
     1.02 . The Plan was adopted by the Board effective as of January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
Effective Date
     For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this Article 2:
 
 
 
 
     3.01 . For each Plan Year, the Committee may select, in its sole discretion, the Employees who shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to that Plan Year. The Committee's selection of an Employee to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year will not entitle that Employee to make a Deferral Election with respect to any subsequent Plan Year, unless the Employee is again selected by the Committee to make a Deferral Election with respect to such subsequent Plan Year.
Selection by Committee
     3.02 . As a condition to being eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to a Plan Year, each selected Employee shall complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form at the time, and in accordance with the terms and conditions, that the Committee may establish from time to time, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. The Committee may in its discretion permit a Newly Eligible Employee to complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form no later than 30 days following the date on which such Employee first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, or such earlier date as the Committee may establish from time to time.
Enrollment Requirements
     3.03 . Provided an Employee selected to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year has met all enrollment requirements set forth in the Plan and any other requirements imposed by the Committee, including submitting an Annual Election Form within the specified time period, the Employee's designated deferrals shall commence as of the first day of the particular Plan Year. In the case of a Newly Eligible Employee, the Newly Eligible Employee's designated deferrals shall commence as of the date such Newly Eligible Employee's Annual Enrollment Form is received by the Committee, but no later than 30 days following the date on which such Employee first became eligible to participate in the Plan, and such Deferral Election shall apply only with respect to the Eligible Compensation earned for services performed subsequent to the time such Annual Election Form is received by the Committee. If an Employee fails to meet all such requirements within the specified time period with respect to any Plan Year, the Employee shall not be eligible to make a Deferral Election for that Plan Year.
Commencement of Participation
     3.04 . The Annual Election Form submitted by a Participant in respect of a particular Plan Year will remain effective with respect to and apply to each subsequent Plan Year unless: (a) the Participant is not an Employee selected to participate in the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year; (b) the Participant files a new Annual Election Form
Subsequent Plan Year Elections
 
for such subsequent Plan Year; (c) the Participant revokes his or her prior Annual Election Form in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for such action; or (d) the Employee's Deferral Election is suspended pursuant to Section 4.01(d) in the immediately preceding Plan Year.
     4.01 .
Participant Deferrals
          (a) . The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in respect of each Plan Year: (i) whether an Employee shall be allowed to participate in the Plan with respect to such Plan Year; (ii) the items of Eligible Compensation which may be deferred with respect to that Plan Year; and (iii) any other terms and conditions applicable to the Deferral Elections for that Plan Year. A Participant's Deferral Election shall be evidenced by an Annual Election Form completed and submitted to the Committee in accordance with the procedures and time frames as may be established by the Committee in its sole discretion. The amounts deferred by a Participant in respect of services rendered during a Plan Year shall be referred to collectively as an Annual Participant Deferral and shall be credited to an Account established in the name of the Participant. Each Participant shall have one Account under the Plan.
Deferral Election
          (b) . The Committee may from time to time designate in the Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year a minimum or maximum deferral amount or percentage, either in the aggregate or per item of Eligible Compensation, applicable with respect to that Plan Year.
Minimum and Maximum Deferrals
          (c) . A Participant may designate the amount of the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from his or her Eligible Compensation as specified in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year, which may provide for deferrals to be expressed as either a percentage or a fixed dollar amount of a specified item of Eligible Compensation expected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee. If a Participant designates the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from any item of Eligible Compensation as a fixed dollar amount and such fixed dollar amount exceeds the amount of such item of Eligible Compensation actually payable to the Participant, the entire amount of such item of Eligible Compensation shall be withheld.
Deferral Designations
          (d) . Except as otherwise provided by Section 3.04, this Section 4.01(d) or elsewhere in the Plan, once made, a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year shall become irrevocable with respect to that Plan Year as of the deadline for Deferral Elections for that Plan Year, as set forth in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials.
Suspension of Deferral Elections
                (i) From and after the date that a Participant is deemed to have suffered a Disability, any standing Deferral Election of the Participant shall automatically be cancelled and no further deferrals shall be made with respect to the Participant.
 
                (ii) If a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency or a hardship distribution pursuant to Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) of the treasury regulations (or any successor thereto), the Participant may petition the Committee to cancel his or her Deferral Election. A petition shall be made on the written form required by the Committee to be used for such request and shall include all information requested by the Committee in order to make a determination on such petition, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to approve the Participant's petition. If the petition for a cancellation is approved, cancellation shall take effect upon the date of approval, and such Deferral Election must be cancelled and not merely postponed or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have any right to approve a request for cancellation of a Deferral Election if such approval (or right to approve) would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to a tax under, Section 409A.
                (iii) If a Participant's Deferral Election has been cancelled during a Plan Year pursuant to this Section 4.01(d), the Participant will not be eligible to make any further deferrals in respect of that Plan Year. The Participant may be eligible to make deferrals for a subsequent Plan Year provided the Participant is an Employee selected to make deferrals for such subsequent Plan Year and the Participant complies with the election requirements under the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year.
          (e) . If a Participant is authorized by the Company for any reason to take a paid leave of absence, so long as the Participant has not had a Separation from Service, the Participant shall continue to be considered employed by the Company and the appropriate amounts shall continue to be withheld from the Participant's compensation pursuant to the Participant's then current Deferral Election.
Paid Leave of Absence
          (f) . If a Participant is authorized by the Company for any reason to take an unpaid leave of absence, so long as the Participant has not had a Separation from Service, the Participant shall continue to be considered employed by the Company and, to the extent permitted by Section 409A, the Participant shall be excused from making deferrals until the earlier of the date the leave of absence expires or the Participant returns to a paid employment status. Upon such expiration or return, deferrals shall resume for the remaining portion of the Plan Year in which the expiration or return occurs, based on the Deferral Election, if any, made for that Plan Year. If no election was made for that Plan Year, no deferral shall be withheld.
Unpaid Leave of Absence
     4.02 . A Participant shall be vested in all amounts credited to his or her Account as of the date such amounts are credited to such Participant's Account.
Vesting
     4.03 .
FICA and Other Taxes
          (a) . For each Plan Year in which an Annual Participant Deferral is being withheld from a Participant, the Company shall withhold from the other compensation payable by the Company to the Participant, in a manner determined by the Company, the Participant's share of FICA and other employment taxes on such amounts. If the Committee determines that such portion may not be sufficient to cover the amount of the applicable withholding, then the Committee may reduce the Annual Participant Deferral to the extent necessary, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, for the Company to comply with applicable withholding requirements.
Annual Deferral Amounts
 
          (b) . The Company shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant under the Plan all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes required to be withheld by the Company, in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to be determined in the sole discretion of the Company.
Distributions
     5.01 . The Committee shall establish from time to time the Designated Funds that will be available under the Plan. At any time, the Committee may, in its discretion, add one or more additional Designated Funds under the Plan, and in connection with any such addition, may permit Participants to select from among the then-available Designated Funds under the Plan to measure the value of such Participants' Accounts. In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Designated Fund at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants' Accounts and future deferrals designated to the discontinued Designated Fund to be reallocated to another Designated Fund.
Designated Funds
     5.02 .
Investment Directions
          (a) Subject to such limitations, operating rules and procedures as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by the Committee, contained elsewhere in the Plan or set forth in any Annual Enrollment Materials, each Participant may communicate to the Investment Agent a direction (in accordance with this Article 5) as to how his or her Account should be deemed to be invested among the Designated Funds made available by the Committee. The Participant's investment directions shall designate the percentage (in any whole percent multiples, which must total 100%) of the portion of the subsequent contributions to the Participant's Account which is requested to be deemed to be invested in such Designated Funds, and shall be subject to the rules set forth below. The Investment Agent shall invest the assets of the Participant's Account in accordance with the directions of the Participant except to the extent that the Committee directs it to the contrary. The Committee has the authority, but not the requirement, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct that a Participant's Account be invested among such investments as it deems appropriate and advisable, which investments need not be the same for each Participant.
          (b) Any initial or subsequent investment direction shall be in writing to the Investment Agent on a form supplied by the Investment Agent, or, as permitted by the Investment Agent, may be by oral designation or electronic transmission designation to the Investment Agent. A designation shall be effective as of the Designation Date next following the date the direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Committee's right to override such direction. The Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, make an investment direction to the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account balance as of a Designation Date and a separate investment direction to the Investment Agent for contribution credits to his or her Account occurring after the Designation Date.
          (c) All amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall be deemed invested in accordance with the then effective investment direction, unless the Committee directs
 
otherwise. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (d) If a Participant files an investment direction with the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account as of a Designation Date which is received and accepted by the Investment Agent and not overridden by the Committee, then the Participant's existing Account shall be deemed to be reallocated as of the next Designation Date (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable) among the designated investment funds according to the percentages specified in such investment direction. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (e) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may place limits on a Participant's ability to make changes with respect to any Designated Funds.
          (f) If the Investment Agent receives an initial or subsequent investment direction with respect to an Account which it deems to be incomplete, unclear or improper, or which is unacceptable for some other reason (determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Agent), the Participant's investment direction for such Account then in effect shall remain in effect (or, in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment direction, the Participant shall be deemed to have filed no investment direction) until the Participant files an investment direction for such Account acceptable to the Investment Agent.
          (g) If the Investment Agent does not possess valid investment directions covering the full balance of a Participant's Account or subsequent contributions thereto (including, without limitation, situations in which no investment direction has been filed, situations in which the investment direction is not acceptable to the Investment Agent under Section 5.02(f), or situations in which some or all of the Participant's designated investments are no longer permissible Designated Funds), the Participant shall be deemed to have directed that the undesignated portion of the Account be invested in a money-market fund or similar short-term investment fund; , , the Committee may provide for the undesignated portion to be allocated to or among the Designated Fund(s) that the Participant did designate in the same proportion as the designated portion, or may provide for any other allocation method it deems appropriate, in its discretion.
provided
however
     5.03 . While a Participant's Account does not represent the Participant's ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant's Account shall be adjusted in accordance with the Designated Fund(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under a Designated Fund (such as interest and cash dividends and distributions) shall, at the Committee's sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Designated Fund or reinvested in one or more other Designated Fund(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of Designated Funds under a Participant's Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant's Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, a Participant's Account may be adjusted from time to time, in
Adjustment of Accounts
 
accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Designated Fund for the Participant's Account. Adjustments made in accordance herewith shall be referred to as Investment Adjustments.
     5.04 . None of the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, shall have any liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation in the Plan, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account. The Investment Agent shall have no liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Investment Agent, and its agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction.
No Investment Liability; Indemnification
     6.01 .
Distribution Elections
          (a) . The Participant shall make a Distribution Election at the time he or she first makes a Deferral Election to have the Participant's Account distributed in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, in each case commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, (i) on a specified date; or (ii) upon the Participant's Separation from Service.
Initial Election
          (b) . Subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee, a Participant may amend his or her Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account once by completing and submitting to the Committee within such time frame as the Committee may designate, an Amended Distribution Election Form; , , that such Amended Distribution Election Form election (i) is not made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment (in the case of a Distribution Election for payment on a specified date or pursuant to a fixed schedule), (ii) does not take effect until 12 months after the date on which such election is made, and (iii) specifies that the payment with respect to which such election is made be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made (in the case of a Distribution Election related to payment other than in the event of death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency). For purposes of this Section 6.01(b), an election to receive the distribution of an Account in a series of installment payments commencing on the payment date shall be treated as an election to receive the payment as a single lump-sum payment on the initial payment date.
Subsequent Election
provided
however
 
     6.02 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid in on a specified date, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, on such specified date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment on Specified Date
     6.03 . Subject to Section 6.06, if a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid upon the Participant's Separation from Service, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, upon the Participant's Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment upon Separation from Service
     6.04 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, if a Participant dies before he or she has received a complete distribution of his or her Account Balance, the Participant's Account Balance shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Section 7.01 in a lump sum within 90 days of the date on which the Committee is notified in writing of the Participant's death, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than the December 31st of the year of death, or if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date of death.
Payment upon Death of Participant
     6.05 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, but subject to Section 6.06, in the event of a Change in Control of Paychex, if such Change of Control constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of Paychex, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Paychex, each with the meaning given such terms by Section 409A, then: (a) the Plan shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, to the extent permissible under and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A; and (b) the Account Balance of each Participant's Account will be paid out in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Payment upon Change in Control of Paychex
     6.06 . Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6.03 and Section 6.05, if a Participant experiences a Separation from Service and the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of Separation from Service, and the payment of the Participant's Account is required to be delayed by six months pursuant to Section 409A, then the payment of the Participant's Account Balance shall be made or commence no earlier than the six-month anniversary of the Participant's Separation from Service.
Six-Month Delay for Specified Employees
 
     6.07 . In the event that a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to receive a partial or full payout of the Account Balance of the Participant's Account. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether the requested payout shall be made, and the amount of the payout; provided, however, that the payout shall not exceed the amount reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. In making its determination under this Section 6.07, the Committee shall be guided by the requirements of Section 409A, and the Committee shall take into account the extent to which a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by the liquidation by the Participant of his or her assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). If, subject to the sole discretion of the Committee, the petition for a payout is approved, the payout shall be made within 30 days of the date of approval, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Withdrawal in the Event of an Unforeseeable Emergency
     6.08 . Distributions under the Plan shall be paid in cash.
Form of Payment
     7.01 .
Designation of Beneficiaries
     (a) Each Participant may designate from time to time any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the Participant's death, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant under the Plan once filed with the Committee, shall be made on a form provided by the Committee for such purpose, and will be effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.
     (b) In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any benefit payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee shall direct distribution of any such benefit payment to the Participant's spouse, if then living, but otherwise to the Participant's then living descendants, if any, per stirpes, but, if none, to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to a benefit payment, the Committee may rely conclusively upon information supplied by the Participant's personal representative, executor or administrator. If a question arises as to the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a benefit payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may direct the distribution of such payment to the Participant's estate without liability for any tax or other consequences which might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as it deems to be appropriate.
     7.02 . Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or to a Beneficiary at his or her last post office address as shown on the Company's records shall
Information to Be Furnished By Participants and Beneficiaries; Inability to Locate Participants or Beneficiaries
 
be binding on the Participant or Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall not be obliged to search for any Participant or Beneficiary beyond the sending of a registered letter to such last known address. If the Committee sends notice in this fashion to any Participant or Beneficiary that he or she is entitled to an amount under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim such amount or make his or her location known to the Committee within three years thereafter, then, except as otherwise required by law, the Committee may, in complete satisfaction of any claim by or through such Participant or Beneficiary, direct distribution as if the Participant or Beneficiary had died or, if the Committee cannot locate the person or persons who is the proper payee in the event of the Participant's or Beneficiary's death, may direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
     8.01 . The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part by the actions of the Committee; , , that (a) no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a Participant's Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had experienced a Separation from Service as of the effective date of the amendment or modification, and (b) no amendment or modification may be made if such amendment or modification would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to tax under, the provisions of Section 409A.
Amendment
provided
however
     8.02 . Although the Company may anticipate that it will continue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any time in the future. Accordingly, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board reserves the right to discontinue its sponsorship of the Plan and to terminate the Plan. In addition, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board may at any time terminate an Affiliate's participation in the Plan.
Termination
     9.01 . This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Members of the Committee may be Participants under the Plan. The Committee shall also have the discretion and authority to (a) make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and (b) decide or resolve any and all questions including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Any individual serving on the Committee who is a Participant shall not vote or act on any matter relating solely to himself or herself. When making a determination or calculation, the Committee shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a Participant or the Company. The decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
Committee Duties
 
     9.02 . In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.
Agents
     10.01 . The Committee shall establish procedures for reviewing claims for benefits under the Plan. Such procedures shall be administered so as to comply with regulations issued by the Department of Labor to the extent that such regulations are applicable to the particular claim at issue. Any Participant, Beneficiary or the estate of a deceased Participant (a "Claimant") shall have the right to be represented by another person in connection with his or her benefit claim, provided that the Committee is provided with satisfactory evidence that the representative has been authorized to act on behalf of the Claimant. The Committee and its authorized designees have the authority and discretion to administer and interpret the Plan and to decide claims for benefits, and their decisions are binding on all parties to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Establishment of Claims Procedures
     10.02 . A Claimant shall present the claim, in writing, to the Committee, and the Committee shall respond in writing. If the claim is denied, the written notice of denial shall, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: (i) state the specific reason or reasons for the denial, with specific references to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based; (ii) describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and explain why such material or information is necessary; (iii) explain the Plan's claims review procedure; and (iv) state that the Claimant has a right to file suit under Section 502(a) of ERISA if the claim is denied on appeal.
Presentation of Claim
     10.03 . The written notice denying or granting the Claimant's claim shall be provided to the Claimant within 90 days after the Committee's receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished by the Committee to the Claimant within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period. Any extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date on which the Committee expects to render a decision on the claim.
Notification of Decision
     10.04 . Any Claimant whose claim is denied and who wishes to appeal must, within 60 days after the Claimant's receipt of notice of the denial, request a review of the denial by notice given, in writing, to the Committee. Upon such a request for review, the claim shall be given a full and fair review by the Committee, which may, but shall not be required to, grant the Claimant a hearing. In connection with the review, the Claimant may have representation, may examine and receive copies (free of charge) of pertinent documents upon request, and may submit issues and comments in writing. The Committee shall consider all information and arguments presented, regardless of whether they were included in the initial claim.
Review of a Denied Claim
 
     10.05 . The decision on review normally shall be made and communicated to the Claimant in writing within 60 days of the Committee's receipt of the request for review. If an extension of time is required due to special circumstances, the Claimant shall be notified, in writing, by the Committee, and the time limit for the decision on review shall be extended to up to 120 days. The written decision on review shall, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: (i) state the reasons for the decision; (ii) cite pertinent Plan provisions; (iii) inform the Claimant that he or she is entitled, upon request and free of charge, reasonably to review and receive copies of relevant documents, and (iv) inform the Claimant of his or her right to bring suit under Section 502(a) of ERISA now that his or her claim has been denied on appeal.
Decision on Review
     11.01 . The Plan is intended to be (a) a plan that is not qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and (b) a plan that "is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1). The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Status of Plan
     11.02 . It is intended that the Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with provisions of Section 409A, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any benefits accrued hereunder in a taxable year prior to the taxable year or years in which such amount would otherwise be actually distributed or made available to the Participants. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Section 409A
     11.03 . Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in any property or assets of the Company. For purposes of the payment of benefits under the Plan, any and all of the Company's assets, shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
     11.04 . Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.
Nonassignability
     11.05 . The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the Company and the Participant. Such
Not a Contract of Employment
 
employment is hereby acknowledged to be an "at will" employment relationship that can be terminated at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice, except as otherwise provided in a written employment agreement. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company as an employee or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge the Participant at any time.
     11.06 . Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.
Terms
     11.07 . The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

     11.08 . Subject to ERISA, the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.

Validity

EXHIBIT 10.2
     1.01 . The purpose of the Plan is to provide non-employee directors of the Company with an opportunity to elect to defer the receipt of a portion of their Eligible Compensation.
Purpose
     1.02 . The Plan was adopted by the Board effective as of January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
Effective Date
     For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this Article 2:
 
 
 
     3.01 . For each Plan Year, the Committee may select, in its sole discretion, the Directors who shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to that Plan Year. The Committee's selection of a Director to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year will not entitle that Director to make a Deferral Election with respect to any subsequent Plan Year, unless the Director is again selected by the Committee to make a Deferral Election with respect to such subsequent Plan Year.
Selection by Committee
     3.02 . As a condition to being eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to a Plan Year, each selected Director shall complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form at the time, and in accordance with the terms and conditions, that the Committee may establish from time to time, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. The Committee may in its discretion permit a Newly Eligible Director to complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form no later than 30 days following the date on which such Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, or such earlier date as the Committee may establish from time to time.
Enrollment Requirements
 
     3.03 . Provided a Director selected to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year has met all enrollment requirements set forth in the Plan and any other requirements imposed by the Committee, including submitting an Annual Election Form within the specified time period, the Director's designated deferrals shall commence as of the first day of the particular Plan Year. In the case of a Newly Eligible Director, the Newly Eligible Director's designated deferrals shall commence as of the date such Newly Eligible Director's Annual Enrollment Form is received by the Committee, but no later than 30 days following the date on which such Director first became eligible to participate in the Plan, and such Deferral Election shall apply only with respect to the Eligible Compensation earned for services performed subsequent to the time such Annual Election Form is received by the Committee. If a Director fails to meet all such requirements within the specified time period with respect to any Plan Year, the Director shall not be eligible to make a Deferral Election for that Plan Year.
Commencement of Participation
     3.04 . The Annual Election Form submitted by a Participant in respect of a particular Plan Year will remain effective with respect to and apply to each subsequent Plan Year unless: (a) the Participant is not a Director selected to participate in the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year; (b) the Participant files a new Annual Election Form for such subsequent Plan Year; (c) the Participant revokes his or her prior Annual Election Form in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for such action; or (d) the Director's Deferral Election is suspended pursuant to Section 4.01(d) in the immediately preceding Plan Year.
Subsequent Plan Year Elections
     4.01 .
Participant Deferrals
          (a) . The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in respect of each Plan Year: (i) whether a Director shall be allowed to participate in the Plan with respect to such Plan Year; (ii) the items of Eligible Compensation which may be deferred with respect to that Plan Year; and (iii) any other terms and conditions applicable to the Deferral Elections for that Plan Year. A Participant's Deferral Election shall be evidenced by an Annual Election Form completed and submitted to the Committee in accordance with the procedures and time frames as may be established by the Committee in its sole discretion. The amounts deferred by a Participant in respect of services rendered during a Plan Year shall be referred to collectively as an Annual Participant Deferral and shall be credited to an Account established in the name of the Participant. Each Participant shall have one Account under the Plan.
Deferral Election
          (b) . The Committee may from time to time designate in the Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year a minimum or maximum deferral amount or percentage, either in the aggregate or per item of Eligible Compensation, applicable with respect to that Plan Year.
Minimum and Maximum Deferrals
          (c) . A Participant may designate the amount of the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from his or her Eligible Compensation as specified in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year, which may provide for
Deferral Designations
 
deferrals to be expressed as either a percentage or a fixed dollar amount of a specified item of Eligible Compensation expected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee. If a Participant designates the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from any item of Eligible Compensation as a fixed dollar amount and such fixed dollar amount exceeds the amount of such item of Eligible Compensation actually payable to the Participant, the entire amount of such item of Eligible Compensation shall be withheld.
          (d) . Except as otherwise provided by Section 3.04, this Section 4.01(d) or elsewhere in the Plan, once made, a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year shall become irrevocable with respect to that Plan Year as of the deadline for Deferral Elections for that Plan Year, as set forth in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials.
Suspension of Deferral Elections
               (i) From and after the date that a Participant is deemed to have suffered a Disability, any standing Deferral Election of the Participant shall automatically be cancelled and no further deferrals shall be made with respect to the Participant.
               (ii) If a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to cancel his or her Deferral Election. A petition shall be made on the written form required by the Committee to be used for such request and shall include all information requested by the Committee in order to make a determination on such petition, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to approve the Participant's petition. If the petition for a cancellation is approved, cancellation shall take effect upon the date of approval, and such Deferral Election must be cancelled and not merely postponed or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have any right to approve a request for cancellation of a Deferral Election if such approval (or right to approve) would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to a tax under, Section 409A.
               (iii) If a Participant's Deferral Election has been cancelled during a Plan Year pursuant to this Section 4.01(d), the Participant will not be eligible to make any further deferrals in respect of that Plan Year. The Participant may be eligible to make deferrals for a subsequent Plan Year provided the Participant is a Director selected to make deferrals for such subsequent Plan Year and the Participant complies with the election requirements under the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year.
     4.02 . A Participant shall be vested in all amounts credited to his or her Account as of the date such amounts are credited to such Participant's Account.
Vesting
     5.01 . The Committee shall establish from time to time the Designated Funds that will be available under the Plan. At any time, the Committee may, in its discretion, add one or more additional Designated Funds under the Plan, and in connection with any such addition, may permit Participants to select from among the then-available Designated Funds under the Plan to measure the value of such Participants' Accounts. In addition, the
Designated Funds
 
Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Designated Fund at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants' Accounts and future deferrals designated to the discontinued Designated Fund to be reallocated to another Designated Fund.
     5.02 .
Investment Directions
          (a) Subject to such limitations, operating rules and procedures as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by the Committee, contained elsewhere in the Plan or set forth in any Annual Enrollment Materials, each Participant may communicate to the Investment Agent a direction (in accordance with this Article 5) as to how his or her Account should be deemed to be invested among the Designated Funds made available by the Committee. The Participant's investment directions shall designate the percentage (in any whole percent multiples, which must total 100%) of the portion of the subsequent contributions to the Participant's Account which is requested to be deemed to be invested in such Designated Funds, and shall be subject to the rules set forth below. The Investment Agent shall invest the assets of the Participant's Account in accordance with the directions of the Participant except to the extent that the Committee directs it to the contrary. The Committee has the authority, but not the requirement, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct that a Participant's Account be invested among such investments as it deems appropriate and advisable, which investments need not be the same for each Participant.
          (b) Any initial or subsequent investment direction shall be in writing to the Investment Agent on a form supplied by the Investment Agent, or, as permitted by the Investment Agent, may be by oral designation or electronic transmission designation to the Investment Agent. A designation shall be effective as of the Designation Date next following the date the direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Committee's right to override such direction. The Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, make an investment direction to the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account balance as of a Designation Date and a separate investment direction to the Investment Agent for contribution credits to his or her Account occurring after the Designation Date.
          (c) All amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall be deemed invested in accordance with the then effective investment direction, unless the Committee directs otherwise. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (d) If a Participant files an investment direction with the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account as of a Designation Date which is received and accepted by the Investment Agent and not overridden by the Committee, then the Participant's existing Account shall be deemed to be reallocated as of the next Designation Date (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable) among the designated investment funds according to the percentages specified in such investment direction. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
 
          (e) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may place limits on a Participant's ability to make changes with respect to any Designated Funds.
          (f) If the Investment Agent receives an initial or subsequent investment direction with respect to an Account which it deems to be incomplete, unclear or improper, or which is unacceptable for some other reason (determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Agent), the Participant's investment direction for such Account then in effect shall remain in effect (or, in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment direction, the Participant shall be deemed to have filed no investment direction) until the Participant files an investment direction for such Account acceptable to the Investment Agent.
          (g) If the Investment Agent does not possess valid investment directions covering the full balance of a Participant's Account or subsequent contributions thereto (including, without limitation, situations in which no investment direction has been filed, situations in which the investment direction is not acceptable to the Investment Agent under Section 5.02(f), or situations in which some or all of the Participant's designated investments are no longer permissible Designated Funds), the Participant shall be deemed to have directed that the undesignated portion of the Account be invested in a money-market fund or similar short-term investment fund; , , the Committee may provide for the undesignated portion to be allocated to or among the Designated Fund(s) that the Participant did designate in the same proportion as the designated portion, or may provide for any other allocation method it deems appropriate, in its discretion.
provided
however
     5.03 . While a Participant's Account does not represent the Participant's ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant's Account shall be adjusted in accordance with the Designated Fund(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under a Designated Fund (such as interest and cash dividends and distributions) shall, at the Committee's sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Designated Fund or reinvested in one or more other Designated Fund(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of Designated Funds under a Participant's Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant's Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, a Participant's Account may be adjusted from time to time, in accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Designated Fund for the Participant's Account. Adjustments made in accordance herewith shall be referred to as Investment Adjustments.
Adjustment of Accounts
     5.04 . None of the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, shall have any liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation in the Plan, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the
No Investment Liability; Indemnification
 
investment of a Participant's Account. The Investment Agent shall have no liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Investment Agent, and its agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction.
     6.01 .
Distribution Elections
          (a) . The Participant shall make a Distribution Election at the time he or she first makes a Deferral Election to have the Participant's Account distributed in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, in each case commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, (i) on a specified date; or (ii) upon the Participant's Separation from Service.
Initial Election
          (b) . Subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee, a Participant may amend his or her Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account once by completing and submitting to the Committee within such time frame as the Committee may designate, an Amended Distribution Election Form; , , that such Amended Distribution Election Form election (i) is not made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment (in the case of a Distribution Election for payment on a specified date or pursuant to a fixed schedule), (ii) does not take effect until 12 months after the date on which such election is made, and (iii) specifies that the payment with respect to which such election is made be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made (in the case of a Distribution Election related to payment other than in the event of death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency). For purposes of this Section 6.01(b), an election to receive the distribution of an Account in a series of installment payments commencing on the payment date shall be treated as an election to receive the payment as a single lump-sum payment on the initial payment date.
Subsequent Election
provided
however
     6.02 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid in on a specified date, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, on such specified date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment on Specified Date
 
     6.03 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid upon the Participant's Separation from Service, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, upon the Participant's Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment upon Separation from Service
     6.04 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, if a Participant dies before he or she has received a complete distribution of his or her Account Balance, the Participant's Account Balance shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Section 7.01 in a lump sum within 90 days of the date on which the Committee is notified in writing of the Participant's death, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than the December 31st of the year of death, or if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date of death.
Payment upon Death of Participant
     6.05 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, in the event of a Change in Control of Paychex, if such Change of Control constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of Paychex, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Paychex, each with the meaning given such terms by Section 409A, then: (a) the Plan shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, to the extent permissible under and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A; and (b) the Account Balance of each Participant's Account will be paid out in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Payment upon Change in Control of Paychex
     6.06 . Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6.03 and Section 6.05, if a Participant experiences a Separation from Service and the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of Separation from Service, and the payment of the Participant's Account is required to be delayed by six months pursuant to Section 409A, then the payment of the Participant's Account Balance shall be made or commence no earlier than the six-month anniversary of the Participant's Separation from Service. "Specified Employee" as of a given date means a as of such date "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A.
Six-Month Delay for Specified Employees
     6.07 . In the event that a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to receive a partial or full payout of the Account Balance of the Participant's Account. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether the requested payout shall be made, and the amount of the payout; provided, however, that the payout shall not exceed the amount reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. In making its determination under this Section 6.07, the Committee shall be guided by the requirements of Section 409A, and the Committee shall take into account the extent to which a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
Withdrawal in the Event of an Unforeseeable Emergency
 
otherwise or by the liquidation by the Participant of his or her assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). If, subject to the sole discretion of the Committee, the petition for a payout is approved, the payout shall be made within 30 days of the date of approval, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
     6.08 . Distributions under the Plan shall be paid in cash.
Form of Payment
     7.01 .
Designation of Beneficiaries
     (a) Each Participant may designate from time to time any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the Participant's death, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant under the Plan once filed with the Committee, shall be made on a form provided by the Committee for such purpose, and will be effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.
     (b) In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any benefit payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee shall direct distribution of any such benefit payment to the Participant's spouse, if then living, but otherwise to the Participant's then living descendants, if any, per stirpes, but, if none, to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to a benefit payment, the Committee may rely conclusively upon information supplied by the Participant's personal representative, executor or administrator. If a question arises as to the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a benefit payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may direct the distribution of such payment to the Participant's estate without liability for any tax or other consequences which might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as it deems to be appropriate.
     7.02 . Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or to a Beneficiary at his or her last post office address as shown on the Company's records shall be binding on the Participant or Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall not be obliged to search for any Participant or Beneficiary beyond the sending of a registered letter to such last known address. If the Committee sends notice in this fashion to any Participant or Beneficiary that he or she is entitled to an amount under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim such amount or make his or her location known to the Committee within three years thereafter, then, except as otherwise required by law, the Committee may, in complete satisfaction of any claim by or through such Participant or Beneficiary, direct distribution as if the Participant or Beneficiary had died or, if the Committee cannot locate the person or persons who is the proper payee in the event of the Participant's or Beneficiary's death, may direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
Information to Be Furnished By Participants and Beneficiaries; Inability to Locate Participants or Beneficiaries
 
     8.01 . The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part by the actions of the Committee; , , that (a) no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a Participant's Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had experienced a Separation from Service as of the effective date of the amendment or modification, and (b) no amendment or modification may be made if such amendment or modification would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to tax under, the provisions of Section 409A.
Amendment
provided
however
     8.02 . Although the Company may anticipate that it will continue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any time in the future. Accordingly, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board reserves the right to discontinue its sponsorship of the Plan and to terminate the Plan. In addition, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board may at any time terminate an Affiliate's participation in the Plan.
Termination
     9.01 . This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Members of the Committee may be Participants under the Plan. The Committee shall also have the discretion and authority to (a) make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and (b) decide or resolve any and all questions including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Any individual serving on the Committee who is a Participant shall not vote or act on any matter relating solely to himself or herself. When making a determination or calculation, the Committee shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a Participant or the Company. The decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
Committee Duties
     9.02 . In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.
Agents
     10.01 . The Plan is intended to be (a) a plan that is not qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and (b) a plan that "is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2),
Status of Plan
 
301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1). The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
     10.02 . It is intended that the Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with provisions of Section 409A, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any benefits accrued hereunder in a taxable year prior to the taxable year or years in which such amount would otherwise be actually distributed or made available to the Participants. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Section 409A
     10.03 . Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in any property or assets of the Company. For purposes of the payment of benefits under the Plan, any and all of the Company's assets, shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
     10.04 . Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.
Nonassignability
     10.05 . The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract with the Company for the Participant to serve on the Board. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company as a Director.
Not a Contract of Service
     10.06 . Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.
Terms
     10.07 . The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
     10.08 . Subject to ERISA, the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
