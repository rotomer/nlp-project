THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 25, 2009  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $528.6 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009 (the "third quarter"), a decrease of 1% from $532.2 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $130.8 million and $0.36 per share, respectively.
     "Our financial results continue to be challenged by weakening economic conditions in the third quarter, as many of our key indicators were weaker than on a year-to-date basis. The most significant change was in the area of checks per client, which declined 4.3% for the third quarter compared to 2.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009. On a positive note, operating income, net of certain items, increased 8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 and improved as a percentage of service revenue from 36.6% to 37.4%," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "We expect the difficult economic conditions will continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2009 and into fiscal 2010. Our people have responded well in managing expenses and we expect to generate a record for operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue for the full year fiscal 2009. During the first nine months of fiscal 2009, our total cash and corporate investments increased more than $100 million to a little over $570 million. Our dividend payout ratio was 80% of net income for the first nine months."
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $381.2 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to price increases and growth in the utilization of ancillary payroll services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 9% to $131.0 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following: comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 6% to 432,000 client employees served; workers' compensation insurance client base increased 8% to 75,000 clients; and retirement services client base increased 6% to 50,000 clients. However, Human Resource Services revenue growth continues to be affected by weakening economic conditions with the most significant impacts to retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services. Retirement services revenue growth was negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the third quarter due to the decline in market values, which decreased the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds 23% to $7.2 billion, and clients' employees moving their retirement portfolios to safer investments. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a lower number of employees per client, reducing revenue by $2.9 million in the third quarter.
     For the third quarter, our operating income was $197.4 million, a decrease of 6% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description) increased 5% to $181.0 million for the third quarter as compared to $173.0 million for the same period last year.
 
 
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 56% to $16.4 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. Investment income decreased 70% to $1.1 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our exposure has been limited in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing in primarily high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of February 28, 2009 are traded in active markets.
     As of February 28, 2009, we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes or prime money market funds. Our primary short term investment option is currently United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have no exposure to auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.8 million as of February 28, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During the nine months ended February 28, 2009, the net unrealized gain/(loss) on our investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $86.6 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $65.5 million as of March 20, 2009.

OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") has been revised to reflect the impacts of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes the economic weakness we have experienced will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year.
     Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 5% to 8% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than the prior year due to lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.
