QUARTER RESULTS

SECOND
QUARTER
FISCAL 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
ROCHESTER, NY,
December 19, 2012
 Paychex, Inc. (Paychex, we, our, or us) (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total service revenue of
$559.4 million
for the
three
months ended
November 30, 2012
(the 
second
quarter), an increase of
5%
from
$535.0 million
for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased
5%
to
$147.9 million
and
$0.41
per share, respectively.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We made solid progress in the second quarter.  While payroll services revenue grew modestly at 1.4%, impacted by client disruptions from Hurricane Sandy, Human Resource Services revenue grew at a double-digit rate as we continue to experience success in selling value-added solutions to our clients. Checks per payroll increased
1.2%
for the quarter over the previous year.  We are seeing good results from our selling efforts in the small-business market and are well-positioned for our peak selling season.  In addition, our client retention levels remain near historic high rates generated by our employees' commitment to client satisfaction.  During the quarter, we introduced our industry-leading online client report center and acquired ExpenseWire, an online expense management solution for our mid-market clients.
Payroll service revenue increased
1%
to
$377.0 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. Checks per payroll increased
1.2%
for the
second
quarter compared to
1.8%
for the same period last year. Revenue per check grew modestly, as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. Growth in payroll service revenue was tempered by lost revenue from Hurricane Sandy, approximating 0.5% of payroll revenue growth, and the impact of client mix in the mid-market.
Human Resource Services (HRS) revenue increased
12%
to
$182.4 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. The following factors contributed to this growth:
Total expenses increased
4%
to
$339.4 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. We continued to invest in product development and supporting technology, with those expenses growing at a faster rate than total expenses during the
second
quarter. This was offset by increased productivity within operations, which has allowed us to maintain solid operating margins.
1
For the
second
quarter, our operating income was
$230.0 million
, an increase of
6%
from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this Non-GAAP financial measure) also increased
6%
to
$220.0 million
for the
second
quarter compared to
$207.2 million
for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased
8%
to
$10.0 million
for the
second
quarter, compared to the same period last year. This was due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a
4%
increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was related to growth in checks per payroll and payroll tax administration services clients, wage inflation, and calendar impacts. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from declines in average yields on high credit quality financial securities. Also, the lower rate of return reflected the mix in the short-term investment portfolio, with a greater percentage of the portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower pre-tax rate of return, but are expected to generate lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income, net, increased
22%
to
$1.9 million
for the
second
quarter, primarily as a result of higher average investment balances from investment of cash generated from operations.
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and with A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of
$62.9 million
as of
November 30, 2012
, compared with a net unrealized gain of
$59.5 million
as of
May 31, 2012
. During the first six months, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio ranged from
$53.8 million
to
$64.1 million
. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately
$54.4 million
as of
December 14, 2012
.

YEAR-TO-DATE
FISCAL 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
The highlights for the
six
months ended
November 30, 2012
are as follows:
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending
May 31, 2013
(
fiscal 2013
) is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our expected full year
fiscal 2013
payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth, offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll, and modest increases in revenue per check. HRS revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience. Prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact on projected revenue growth rates for
fiscal 2013
.
Our revised guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue is expected to be approximately
37%
for
fiscal 2013
. The effective income tax rate for
fiscal 2013
is expected to approximate the tax rate for the first
six
months.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for
fiscal 2013
are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment. Our rate of return will be impacted by an anticipated change in mix in our short-term portfolio to a greater percentage of tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower rate of return, but are expected to lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income growth reflects the impact of anticipated lower average investment balances in the second half of the fiscal year.
Note 1
: In addition to reporting operating income, a United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following years targets and measuring managements performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.
