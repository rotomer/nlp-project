FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JULY 19, 2007
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS 2ND QUARTER IMPROVEMENT IN NET INCOME OF 61 PERCENT OVER PRIOR YEAR AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR FUNDING ITS NEWLY ESTABLISHED CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $13.5 million, or $0.05 per share, for the second quarter of 2007. The current quarter's results reflect the previously announced $60 million contribution to the People's United Community Foundation, which had the effect of reducing net income by $39.6 million, or $0.13 per share. Excluding this charge, net income would have been $53.1 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to $32.9 million, or $0.11 per share, for the second quarter of 2006. Prior period per share information has been adjusted to reflect the exchange of People's Bank common stock for 2.1 shares of People's United Financial common stock upon completing the second-step conversion on April 16, 2007.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
For the second quarter of 2007, return on average assets was 0.40 percent and return on average stockholders' equity was 1.4 percent, compared to 1.20 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively, for the year-ago quarter. Return on average assets and return on average stockholders' equity would have been 1.59 percent and 5.34 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2007, excluding the previously mentioned $60 million contribution.
The Board of Directors of People's United Financial declared a $0.1333 per share quarterly dividend, payable August 15, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 1, 2007. Based on the closing stock price on July 18, 2007, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 3.1 percent.
President and Chief Executive Officer, John A. Klein stated, "The successful completion of our second-step conversion in April, which raised $3.44 billion in gross proceeds, followed by our recent announcement of an agreement to acquire the Chittenden Corporation, were truly significant milestones for the company."

Klein added, "In addition, the announcement of our rebranding to People's United Bank will facilitate our plans for continued growth in new and existing markets, while at the same time emphasizing our commitment to our customers and communities. Our funding of the People's United Community Foundation also exemplifies this commitment."
Klein concluded, "And, of course, in mid-June we opened our first Westchester County, New York branch in an attractive Scarsdale location. Overall, it has been a busy quarter in which we nonetheless continued to deliver strong financial results."
"Key drivers of the company's performance this quarter were a significant increase in the net interest margin and ongoing strong asset quality," said Philip R. Sherringham, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The year-over-year 41 basis point improvement in the net interest margin reflects the benefits from the investment of the net proceeds from our second-step conversion and the balance sheet restructuring activities completed during 2006."
Sherringham continued, "Average earning assets increased $2.4 billion on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increases of $3.2 billion in average short-term investments as a result of the second-step conversion and $272 million, or 3 percent, in average loans, while average securities declined $1.0 billion, or 93 percent. While average commercial banking loans increased 9 percent on a year-over-year basis, average residential mortgage loans actually declined 2 percent as a result of our decision to sell all newly-originated residential mortgage loans in the current environment."
Sherringham added, "Although non-interest expenses increased $7.6 million, or 9 percent, from the first quarter of 2007, the large increase in net interest income due to the investment of the proceeds from the second-step conversion led to a significant improvement in the efficiency ratio to 53 percent this quarter."
Commenting on asset quality, Sherringham stated, "Second quarter net loan charge-offs included a $3.6 million charge-off relating to one commercial banking loan that has been classified as non-performing since December 2006, comprising substantially all of total net loan charge-offs of $3.7 million for the second quarter of 2007, compared to $0.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.16 percent in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 0.01 percent in the second quarter of last year."
At June 30, 2007, non-performing assets totaled $18.4 million, a $1.0 million, or 5 percent, decrease from March 31, 2007. Non-performing assets equaled 0.20 percent of total loans, REO and repossessed assets, compared to 0.21 percent at March 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 405 percent at June 30, 2007, compared to 389 percent at March 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remained at 0.80 percent at both June 30, 2007 and March 31, 2007.

Selected Financial Terms
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as core deposits, purchased funds and the efficiency ratio. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts.
Core deposits is a measure of stable funding sources and is defined as total deposits, other than brokered certificates of deposit (acquired in the wholesale market), municipal deposits (which are seasonally variable by nature) and escrow deposits from People's United Financial's subscription offering. Purchased funds include borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit and municipal deposits.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) to net interest income plus total non-interest income (excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income). People's United Financial generally considers an income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years. Management considers the efficiency ratio to be more representative of People's United Financial's ongoing operating efficiency, as the excluded items are generally related to external market conditions and non-routine transactions.
