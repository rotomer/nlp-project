On December 7, 2007, the Board of Directors of People's United Financial, Inc. (the "Company") approved a variety of actions relating to the compensation of directors and certain executive officers.
Directors' Equity Compensation Plan
All non-employee members of the Board of Directors had previously voted to forego receipt of shares of Company stock otherwise payable to them on October 18, 2007 pursuant to the Directors' Equity Compensation Plan, pending decisions that might be made at a later date regarding grants that might be made to directors pursuant to the 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and/or the 2007 Stock Option Plan. Absent that vote, each non-employee director would have received 5,484 shares of Company stock following the Company's annual meeting of shareholders on October 18, 2007.
After considering the level of equity grants made to non-employee directors pursuant to the Recognition and Retention Plan and the Stock Option Plan (discussed below), the Board (including all non-employee directors) voted to permanently forego receipt of all shares of Company stock that otherwise would have been issuable to the non-employee directors pursuant to the Directors' Equity Compensation Plan on October 18, 2007.
Grants under Recognition and Retention Plan and Stock Option Plan
Non-employee directors received grants of restricted stock and stock options under the Company's 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan and 2007 Stock Option Plan. Grants were as follows:
 
All of the awards will vest in 20% annual increments over the next five years. The exercise price of all stock options is $17.085, which was the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
Copies of the form of agreements pursuant to which grants were made under the above-referenced plans are being filed as exhibits hereto.
Changes to Board Compensation Schedule
The compensation schedule for members of the Board was revised to provide for payment of an annual retainer of $165,000 to any non-employee director serving as Chairman of the Board. The compensation schedule was also revised to provide that the separate annual retainer of $65,000 payable to the Lead Director would not be payable to a non-employee director serving both as Chairman of the Board and as Lead Director, nor would the separate annual retainer of $4,000 payable to the Chairman of the Executive Committee be payable to a non-employee director serving both as Chairman of the Board and as Chairman of the Executive Committee.
Amendments to Compensation of Acting CEO
The Board approved an increase in Mr. Sherringham's base compensation to $740,000 annually, effective for the period during which he serves as Acting President and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company in the absence of John A. Klein. The Board also approved an increase (to $500,000) in the annual base compensation payable to Mr. Sherringham in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer, which will become effective at such time as Mr. Sherringham relinquishes his duties as Acting President and Acting Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the Board approved a change in the target short-term incentive plan bonus for Mr. Sherringham for the period during which he serves as Acting President and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The target bonus will be 80% of Mr. Sherringham's annual base compensation for service in that capacity as described above, compared to a target bonus equal to 70% of his annual base compensation in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer.
 
On December 7, 2007, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the Company's Bylaws. Article IV, Section 4 was amended to provide that the director appointed to serve as Lead Director may also serve as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board. Article IV, Section 5 was amended (a) to permit the director serving as Lead Director to continue to serve as a member of the Board until the expiration of the term of office as a director during which the director attains the age of 75, and (b) to eliminate a similar rule previously applicable to the Vice Chairman of the Board. The amendments became effective upon approval by the Board. A copy of the Bylaw amendments is being filed herewith as Exhibit 3.2.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3.2
Sections 4 and 5 of Article IV of the Bylaws of People's United Financial, Inc. have been amended, effective December 7, 2007, to read as follows:
SECTION 4. LEAD DIRECTOR. The Board shall at each annual meeting appoint from among its members a Lead Director, who shall be an independent director and who may also serve as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board. The Lead Director shall perform such duties as may be assigned to him or her from time to time by the Board. The Lead Director shall serve for a one year term or until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified.
SECTION 5. AGE LIMITATION OF DIRECTORS. With the exception of the Lead Director of the Board, a director shall retire from service as a director of the Corporation at the expiration of the term of office during which such Director has reached the age of seventy-two. The Director serving as Lead Director of the Board shall retire from service as a director of the Corporation at the expiration of the three year term of office during which such Director reaches the age of seventy-five.
A complete copy of the Bylaws, reflecting the foregoing amendments, will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2007.

Exhibit 10.26A
For Executive Officers and CEO Only
In accordance with the terms of the People's United Financial, Inc. 2007 Recognition and Retention Plan (the "Plan"), People's United Financial, Inc. ("People's United") is pleased to grant you an award (the "Award") of shares of People's United Common Stock (the "Shares"). The Award shall consist of two parts: a retention award equal to 55% of the Award (the "Retention Award"), and a recognition award equal to the remaining 45% of the Award (the "Recognition Award"). The Shares granted to you under this Agreement are subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3 hereof and to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan.
            
You and People's United agree that the Award is subject to the following terms and conditions:
1. . All of the terms and provisions of the Plan are deemed incorporated into this Agreement by reference to the same purpose and effect as if the Plan were set forth in its entirety in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement and defined in the Plan shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the same meanings as in the Plan. The term "Common Stock" refers to the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of People's United Financial, Inc., and includes any stock or other securities into which shares of Common Stock may be changed as contemplated by Section 8.3 of the Plan. The terms "person" and "security," and any variations of such terms, shall have the broadest meanings assigned to them by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act.
Definitions
2. . The Award is granted and made effective (the "Grant Date"). Each Share has a fair market value of $ on the Grant Date. For the purposes of this Agreement, the fair market value of each Share was calculated based on the mean between the high and low selling prices of the Common Stock as reported by the NASDAQ Stock Market on the Grant Date.
Grant Date
                    
            
3. . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, you may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares until they have vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement (the "Restriction Period"). For a period of two years following vesting of Shares (the "Additional
Restrictions on Transfer of Shares
Restriction Period"), you may only sell or transfer vested Shares (a) in an amount sufficient to pay any applicable federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind (which, for these purposes, shall be determined based on the assumption that you are subject to maximum applicable tax rates), plus (b) up to fifty percent (50%) of vested Shares remaining after any sale or transfer permitted under clause (a). Furthermore, from time to time the Board may establish certain minimum Common Stock ownership guidelines or requirements applicable to you, which it will communicate to you in writing. Notwithstanding the vesting of Shares and your right to sell or transfer a portion of the Shares during the Additional Restriction Period, you agree that you will not sell or otherwise transfer Shares if the consequence of such sale or transfer would reduce your total Common Stock ownership below such minimum ownership guidelines or requirements as they may exist at the time you would otherwise wish to sell or transfer Shares. In the event you fail to satisfy such minimum ownership guidelines or requirements as a result of the sale or transfer of Shares, the Committee may impose limitations on any further sales of Shares by you, and you agree to abide by any such limitations.
People's United will permit transfer of the Shares only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any transfer of the Shares made in any manner contrary to this Agreement will be void and ineffective to constitute the transferee a shareholder of People's United entitled to any rights, benefits or privileges as such.
4. . Twenty percent (20%) of the Shares will vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date (); twenty percent (20%) of the Shares will vest on the second anniversary of the Grant Date (); twenty percent (20%) of the Shares will vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date (); twenty percent (20%) of the Shares will vest on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date (); and the remaining twenty percent (20%) of the Shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date (). Vesting will occur only if you have continuously been an employee of an Employer from the Grant Date through the vesting date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares that comprise the Recognition Award that are unvested as of the date of your termination of employment with an Employer by reason of your death or Disability shall vest immediately upon such termination, and the Restriction Period and Additional Restriction Period applicable to all such Shares shall expire. Shares that comprise the Retention Award that are unvested as of the date of your termination of employment with an Employer shall not vest upon termination of employment by reason of your death or Disability, and will be forfeited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, all unvested Shares shall become 100% vested upon the occurrence of a Change of Control if you are an employee of an Employer at the time a Change of Control occurs, and the Restriction Period and Additional Restriction Period applicable to all such Shares shall expire.

5. . You will forfeit all unvested Shares upon the termination of your employment with an Employer for any reason (other than death or Disability, as provided in Section 4 above with respect to the Recognition Award, and other than upon the occurrence of a Change of Control) during the applicable Restriction Period. When you forfeit Shares, all of your interest in the Shares will be cancelled. You agree to take any action and execute and deliver any document that People's United requests to effect the return of your unvested forfeited Shares.
Forfeiture
6. . You will have the right to vote the Shares from the Grant Date, whether or not Shares have vested. Your right to vote the Shares will expire immediately upon forfeiture.
Voting
7. . Any cash dividends or distributions declared and paid with respect to Shares that are, as of the record date for such dividend, allocated to you in connection with the Award (as described in Section 9 below), will be paid to you as soon as practicable. Dividends will be paid to you, and will be taxable in the same manner as other compensation paid to you, by People's United. By signing this agreement and accepting its terms, you direct the Funding Agent to remit to People's United for payment to you any dividends that either of them may receive as the record holder of your unvested Shares.
Cash Dividends
8. . Dividends or distributions paid in property other than cash with respect to Shares will be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions as are applicable to the Shares to which the Award relates.
Other Distributions
9. . The Shares will be allocated to you and held by the Funding Agent on your behalf until the applicable vesting date. Subject to limitations on transfer during the Additional Restriction Period, on each such vesting date, you will obtain unrestricted ownership of the Shares that vest on such vesting date. A stock certificate (or book entry listing) evidencing your ownership of the vested Shares will be provided to you or indicated on People's United's stock transfer books.
Share Allocation and Certificates
10. . If People's United issues certificates representing vested Shares, it may postpone the delivery of the certificates for such Shares for such time as it deems necessary or desirable to enable it to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, any rules or regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, or the requirements of applicable state laws relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of securities generally.
Delivery of Certificates
11. . In the event of any changes in People's United's capital structure during the term of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 8.3 of the Plan shall apply.
Adjustments in Shares

Modification and Waiver
14. . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.
Binding Effect
15. . Any dispute or disagreement that may arise under, or in any way may relate to, the interpretation, construction or application of this Agreement shall be subject to determination by the Committee after appropriate notice to the affected parties and reasonable opportunity to be heard by the Committee. Any determination made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes.
Resolution of Controversies
16. . All notices, requests, demands, or other communications required, permitted or contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed effectively served, delivered or otherwise made (a) upon receipt if manually delivered, or (b) upon the delivery date shown on the returned receipt (or if delivery is refused, on the date presented for delivery) if mailed by United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, and if intended for People's United, directed to the Committee's attention at People's United Bank, 850 Main Street, Bridgeport, Connecticut 06604; or if intended for you, directed to you at the address set forth below immediately following your signature.

Exhibit 10.27A
For Executive Officers and CEO Only
In accordance with the terms of the People's United Financial, Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), People's United Financial, Inc. ("People's United") is pleased to grant you a Non-Qualified Stock Option (the "Option") to purchase shares of People's United Common Stock (the "Optioned Shares"). The Option shall consist of two parts: a retention award equal to 55% of the Optioned Shares (the "Retention Award"), and a recognition award equal to the remaining 45% of the Optioned Shares (the "Recognition Award"). The Option is exercisable at the times specified in Section 3 of this Agreement, and is subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in the Plan.
            
You and People's United agree that the Option is subject to the following terms and conditions:
1. . All of the terms and provisions of the Plan are deemed incorporated into this Agreement by reference to the same effect as if the Plan were set forth herein in its entirety. All terms used in this Agreement and defined in the Plan shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the same meanings as in the Plan. The term "Common Stock" refers to the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of People's United Financial, Inc., and includes any stock or other securities into which such shares of Common Stock may be changed, as contemplated by Section 7.3 of the Plan. The terms "affiliate", "directors", "person", and "security", or any variations of such terms, shall have the broadest meanings assigned to them by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act. The terms "you" and "your" shall include, when the context requires, any persons entitled to exercise the Option by virtue of Section 6 of this Agreement.
Definitions
2. . The Option is granted and made effective (the "Grant Date") and shall expire at the end of the Option Period as specified in Section 8 of this Agreement. The Exercise Price for the Option is $ per share, which represents the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date.
Grant Date; Term of Option; Option Price
            
            
3. . (a) Provided that the Option has not sooner expired in accordance with the Plan or Section 8 hereof, the Option will be exercisable with respect to twenty percent (20%) of the Optioned Shares on each anniversary of the Grant Date
Exercise of Option
beginning on the first anniversary () and continuing through the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date (). The Option will only be exercisable if you have continuously been an employee of an Employer from the Grant Date through the exercise date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option will become immediately exercisable with respect to Optioned Shares that are not yet exercisable and that comprise the Recognition Award as of the date of your termination of employment with an Employer by reason of your death or Disability. The Option relating to Optioned Shares that comprise the Retention Award that are not yet exercisable as of the date of your termination of employment with an Employer shall not become exercisable upon termination of employment by reason of your death or Disability, and will be forfeited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, all Optioned Shares shall become fully exercisable upon the occurrence of a Change of Control if you are an employee of an Employer at the time a Change of Control occurs.
                    
                    
Once Optioned Shares have become available for purchase in accordance with the foregoing schedule, any unpurchased Optioned Shares included in an installment or part of an installment of Optioned Shares shall remain subject to purchase on a cumulative basis until the Option expires in accordance with the Plan or Section 8 hereof. The Option may not be exercised for fractional shares of Common Stock, and all fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole number below the actual number of shares.
(b) Subject to the provisions of the Plan, upon exercise of the Option, or any part thereof, and purchase of the Optioned Shares relating to such exercise ("Purchased Shares"), you may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber Purchased Shares for a period of two years following exercise of the Option and purchase of the Purchased Shares (the "Transfer Restriction Period"), except that you may sell or transfer (a) Purchased Shares in an amount sufficient to pay any applicable federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind (which, for these purposes, shall be determined based on the assumption that you are subject to maximum applicable tax rates), plus (b) Purchased Shares in an amount sufficient to pay the Exercise Price, plus (c) up to fifty percent (50%) of the Purchased Shares remaining after any sale or transfer permitted under clauses (a) and (b). Furthermore, from time to time the Board may establish certain minimum Common Stock ownership guidelines or requirements applicable to you, which it will communicate to you in writing. Notwithstanding your right to sell or transfer a portion of the Purchased Shares during the Transfer Restriction Period, you agree that you will not sell or otherwise transfer Purchased Shares if the consequence of such sale or transfer would reduce your total Common Stock ownership below such minimum ownership guidelines or requirements as they may exist at the time you would otherwise wish to sell or transfer Purchased Shares. In the event you fail to satisfy such minimum ownership guidelines or requirements as a result of the sale or transfer of Purchased Shares, the Committee may impose limitations on any further sales of Optioned Shares by you, and you agree to abide by any such limitations.
People's United will permit transfer of the Optioned Shares only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any transfer of Optioned Shares made in any manner contrary to this Agreement will be void and ineffective to constitute the transferee a shareholder of People's United entitled to any rights, benefits or privileges as such.
4. . You (or such other person as is provided in Section 6 hereof) may exercise the Option only by delivering written notice to People's United setting forth your irrevocable election to purchase all or a designated part of any then exercisable installment or installments of Optioned Shares. Subject to Section 8 hereof, the notice of exercise must be delivered to People's United on or before the close of business on a date which is or precedes the last day of the Option Period, except that if the last day of the Option Period is a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which either the corporate headquarters of People's United or the markets for equity securities generally are closed, the notice shall be delivered before the close of business on the business day preceding the last day of the Option Period.
Method of Exercise
The notice shall contain specific reference to this Agreement and the Plan and must be signed by you (or by such other person as is provided in Section 6 hereof). The notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Exercise Price by cash, certified or bank check or, if the Committee consents, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of Common Stock already owned by you or in shares of Restricted Stock, as provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan. Payment for any Optioned Shares to be purchased upon exercise of the Option may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to People's United, together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to People's United the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the purchase price. If at any time this Agreement is in effect, you are or potentially could be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, an election to make payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") promulgated thereunder, as interpreted by the Committee. No Optioned Shares shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made or the Committee has approved alternative arrangements for payment.

Any exercise of the Option by your legal representative or by the executor or other legal representative of your estate shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Plan and shall entitle such representative to no greater part of the Optioned Shares than you could have acquired if you had exercised the Option at the time of termination of employment with an Employer by reason of your death or Disability.
7. . People's United may postpone the time of delivery of certificates for the Optioned Shares for such time as it deems necessary or desirable to enable it to comply with the listing requirements of any securities exchange or stock quotation system upon which the Common Stock may be listed or quoted, the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, any rules or regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, or the requirements of applicable state laws relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of securities generally.

During the Option Period, People's United will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock, or from its treasury stock (or from both), a sufficient number of shares to provide for the delivery of the Optioned Shares upon exercise of the Option in accordance herewith and subject to the provisions of Section 7 hereof. If the Option should expire, lapse or otherwise become unexercisable for any reason specified in or contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan, to the extent that the Option shall not have been exercised as to the full number of the Optioned Shares subject thereto, the unpurchased Optioned Shares shall be deemed freed automatically from any such reservation and shall become immediately available for issuance and delivery pursuant to other option agreements under the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
10. . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Option in accordance herewith, upon issuance, delivery and payment for such shares in accordance with this Agreement, shall constitute validly issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of People's United.

Exhibit 10.27C
For Non-Employee Directors Only
In accordance with the terms of the People's United Financial, Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), People's United Financial, Inc. ("People's United") is pleased to grant you a Non-Qualified Stock Option (the "Option") to purchase shares of People's United Common Stock (the "Optioned Shares"). The Option shall consist of two parts: a retention award equal to 55% of the Optioned Shares (the "Retention Award"), and a recognition award equal to the remaining 45% of the Optioned Shares (the "Recognition Award"). The Option is exercisable at the times specified in Section 3 of this Agreement, and is subject to the other terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in the Plan.
            
You and People's United agree that the Option is subject to the following terms and conditions:
1. . All of the terms and provisions of the Plan are deemed incorporated into this Agreement by reference to the same effect as if the Plan were set forth herein in its entirety. All terms used in this Agreement and defined in the Plan shall, unless otherwise defined herein, have the same meanings as in the Plan. The term "Common Stock" refers to the Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of People's United Financial, Inc., and includes any stock or other securities into which such shares of Common Stock may be changed, as contemplated by Section 7.3 of the Plan. The terms "affiliate", "directors", "person", and "security", or any variations of such terms, shall have the broadest meanings assigned to them by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act. The terms "you" and "your" shall include, when the context requires, any persons entitled to exercise the Option by virtue of Section 6 of this Agreement.

Exercise of Option
beginning on the first anniversary () and continuing through the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date (). The Option will only be exercisable if you have continuously been an Eligible Director of an Employer from the Grant Date through the exercise date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option will become immediately exercisable with respect to Optioned Shares that are not yet exercisable and that comprise the Recognition Award as of the date of your termination of Service with an Employer by reason of your death or Disability. The Option relating to Optioned Shares that comprise the Retention Award that are not yet exercisable as of the date of your termination of Service with an Employer shall not become exercisable upon termination of Service by reason of your death or Disability, and will be forfeited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, all Optioned Shares shall become fully exercisable upon the occurrence of a Change of Control if you are an Eligible Director of an Employer at the time a Change of Control occurs.
                    
                    
Once Optioned Shares have become available for purchase in accordance with the foregoing schedule, any unpurchased Optioned Shares included in an installment or part of an installment of Optioned Shares shall remain subject to purchase on a cumulative basis until the Option expires in accordance with the Plan or Section 8 hereof. The Option may not be exercised for fractional shares of Common Stock, and all fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole number below the actual number of shares.
4. . You (or such other person as is provided in Section 6 hereof) may exercise the Option only by delivering written notice to People's United setting forth your irrevocable election to purchase all or a designated part of any then exercisable installment or installments of Optioned Shares. Subject to Section 8 hereof, the notice of exercise must be delivered to People's United on or before the close of business on a date which is or precedes the last day of the Option Period, except that if the last day of the Option Period is a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which either the corporate headquarters of People's United or the markets for equity securities generally are closed, the notice shall be delivered before the close of business on the business day preceding the last day of the Option Period.
Method of Exercise
The notice shall contain specific reference to this Agreement and the Plan and must be signed by you (or by such other person as is provided in Section 6 hereof). The notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Exercise Price by cash, certified or bank check or, if the Committee consents, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of Common Stock already owned by you, as provided in Section 6.1 of the Plan. Payment for any Optioned Shares to be purchased upon exercise of the Option may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to People's United, together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to People's United the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the purchase price. If at any time this Agreement is in effect, you are or potentially could be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, an election to make payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") promulgated thereunder, as interpreted by the Committee.
