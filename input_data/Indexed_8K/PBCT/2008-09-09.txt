Investment Thesis
PBCT's strong capital position and disciplined emphasis on credit performance provide an important measure of safety in the current environment.
The ability to leverage the capital raised in 2007 positions us well for future expansion.
Why own People's United? 
Strong balance sheet with significant capital surplus
Exceptional credit quality
Significant and very low cost deposit market share
Committed to maximizing long-term earnings power and shareholder value
 
Investment Thesis
Our focus on long-term earnings optimization translates into:
Things we do:
Continue to focus on self-originated middle market commercial loans while retaining our underwriting discipline
Continue to use our securities & short-term investments portfolio solely as a temporary store of excess capital, while not stretching for temporary spread income
Remain primarily funded with equity and deposits
Strive to keep our expense structure lean
Remain vigilant as we explore acquisition opportunities, to ensure any deal improves long-term earnings and shareholder value
Things we don't do:
Originate sub-prime or Alt-A loans
Originate option ARMs, negative amortization loans, or teaser-rate loans
Have SIV exposure or CDOs on the balance sheet
Make high-risk structured investments
Leverage the balance sheet using wholesale funding to purchase loans or securities (no carry trade)
 
Commercial Banking
People's United remains focused on growing core middle market commercial loans and deposits
Average C&I lending increased 12% annualized in 2Q08

While we remain committed to achieving a lower efficiency ratio, this will take time given:
Lower interest income from our excess capital in the current rate environment
The long-term displacement of investment securities with loans, which has eliminated any carry trade
21
 
Acquisition Strategy
We continue to feel properly priced, opportunistic acquisitions can significantly enhance shareholder value, assuming the following:
Commercially-oriented franchises with a strong core deposit base
Attractive markets of the Northeast United States, including contiguous, in-market and new markets
Ability to leverage PBCT excellent credit standards
Generate an IRR approaching 20%
22
 
Conclusion
People's United remains committed to continuing to increase shareholder value
Shareholders are protected by continued strength in underwriting and asset quality
Significant capital reserves will be used primarily to fund future growth
Management is aligned with shareholders
Will continue to maintain focus on driving financial performance
