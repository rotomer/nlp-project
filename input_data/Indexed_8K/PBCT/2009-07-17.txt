FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JULY 16, 2009
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER
EARNINGS OF $27 MILLION OR $0.08 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $27.4 million, or $0.08 per share, for the second quarter of 2009, compared to $26.7 million, or $0.08 per share, for the first quarter of 2009, and $43.0 million, or $0.13 per share, for the second quarter of 2008. Second quarter 2009 earnings reflect continued margin pressure associated with the historically low interest rate environment and the company's asset sensitive balance sheet, and security gains that served to offset an FDIC special assessment charge.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
For the second quarter of 2009, return on average tangible assets was 0.57 percent and return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 3.0 percent, compared to 0.57 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2009. At June 30, 2009, People's United Financial's tangible equity ratio stood at 18.7 percent.
The Board of Directors of People's United Financial declared a $0.1525 per share quarterly dividend, payable August 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on August 1, 2009. Based on the closing stock price on July 15, 2009, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 3.9 percent.
"Our second quarter performance reflects continued growth in our core commercial and home equity loan portfolios and deposits during a difficult economic environment, specifically as it relates to the current level of interest rates and our asset-sensitive balance sheet," stated Philip R. Sherringham, President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, the pillars of our financial position  strong asset quality and prudent management of our excess capital  have served us well in these challenging times. Modest levels of net loan charge-offs and nine percent year-over-year growth in our core lending portfolios continue to differentiate us from most in the banking sector. Despite an increase in non-performing assets during the quarter as the economy continued to show signs of weakness, we still believe that any potential losses attributable to those assets will be limited."

Sherringham added, "While we are well-positioned to benefit from future increases in interest rates given our asset-sensitivity, the current rate environment continues to pressure our net interest margin. Our strategic focus remains on expansion through opportunistic acquisitions even as we continue to pursue organic growth throughout our franchise. The strength of our capital and liquidity, asset quality and earnings, as well as the fact that our balance sheet continues to be funded almost entirely by deposits and stockholders' equity, are features that set us apart from most in the industry."
Sherringham continued, "We believe one important catalyst for growth is our ability to enhance the customer experience. With this in mind, we were very pleased to announce in May that J.D. Power and Associates ranked People's United Bank Highest Customer Satisfaction with Retail Banking in the New England Region.' This recognition underscores our long-term commitment to our customers. Our continued core business growth in these challenging times is, of course, the most tangible indication of our customers' satisfaction."
"Significant drivers of the company's performance this quarter were loan growth across our strategic lending businesses, continued low levels of net loan charge-offs, improved fee income, and expense control, partially offset by continued margin pressure and our decision to increase the allowance for loan losses," said Paul D. Burner, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Compared to the first quarter of 2009, average commercial banking loans, excluding shared national credits, increased $125 million, or 6 percent annualized, while our home equity loan portfolio increased $20 million, or 4 percent annualized."
Burner continued, "In addition, during the second quarter, mortgage-backed securities with a book value of $723 million were sold, with a portion of the proceeds reinvested in mortgage-backed securities with longer maturities and substantially-equivalent yields. This investment portfolio repositioning, which was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk, generated security gains totaling $12.0 million. Total non-interest expense, adjusted for the FDIC special assessment charge in the second quarter and one-time charges in the first quarter, increased a modest $1.5 million during the period. The 13 basis point decline in the net interest margin was primarily attributable to an increase of $540 million, or 15 percent annualized, in average deposits during the second quarter that were invested in federal funds at 25 basis points."
Commenting on asset quality, Burner stated, "As previously disclosed, a single shared national credit accounted for $17 million, or 40 percent, of the increase in non-performing loans this quarter. Another $9.1 million, or 22 percent, of the increase was attributable to the residential mortgage portfolio, which is a reflection of higher levels of unemployment across our franchise, while $7.5 million, or 18 percent, of the increase was noted within the equipment financing portfolio, reflecting broader economic weakness. Notwithstanding the increase in non-performing assets, our continued low level of net loan charge-offs in this current economic environment is a testament to our disciplined underwriting standards."
Second quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $6.0 million compared to $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.16 percent in the second quarter of 2009 compared to 0.18 percent in this year's first quarter. The provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2009 reflects an $8.0 million increase in the allowance for loan losses to $167.0 million at June 30, 2009.

At June 30, 2009, non-performing loans totaled $168.0 million and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.15 percent, compared to $126.1 million and 0.86 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2009. Non-performing assets totaled $182.0 million at June 30, 2009, a $40.0 million increase from March 31, 2009. Non-performing assets equaled 1.25 percent of total loans, REO and repossessed assets at June 30, 2009 compared to 0.97 percent at March 31, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.15 percent and as a percentage of non-performing loans was 99 percent, compared to 1.09 percent and 126 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2009.

Selected Financial Terms
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non-interest expense control.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be nonrecurring if it not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
