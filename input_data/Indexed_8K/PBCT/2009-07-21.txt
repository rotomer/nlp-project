On July 16, 2009, the Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of People's United Financial, Inc. (the Company) approved changes to the manner in which dividends payable on unvested shares of restricted stock awarded under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan will be paid out to award recipients.
Prior to the Committee's action, cash dividends paid with respect to shares of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan were accumulated for the benefit of the grant recipient in a non-interest bearing account, and were paid out to the grant recipient as soon as practicable after the end of the applicable restriction period. Beginning with the cash dividend to be paid by the Company on August 15, 2009, cash dividends paid with respect to shares of restricted stock granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan will be paid to the grant recipient at the same time as dividends are paid on all other shares of the Company's common stock, regardless of whether the restricted stock awards have vested.
Dividends previously accrued but not paid to the holders of unvested restricted stock awards made pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan based on prior practice will also be paid out to holders of those awards as soon as administratively practicable.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
