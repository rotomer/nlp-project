FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OCTOBER 15, 2009
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $27 MILLION OR $0.08 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $26.8 million, or $0.08 per share, for the third quarter of 2009, compared to $25.3 million, or $0.08 per share, for the second quarter of 2009, and $46.0 million, or $0.14 per share, for the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter 2009 earnings reflect an increase in the net interest margin despite pressure associated with the historically low interest rate environment and the company's asset sensitive balance sheet, and an increase in the provision for loan losses due, in part, to the partial charge-off of a previously disclosed non-performing shared national credit.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
For the third quarter of 2009, return on average tangible assets was 0.55 percent and return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 3.0 percent, compared to 0.53 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2009. At September 30, 2009, People's United Financial's tangible equity ratio stood at 18.6 percent.
The Board of Directors of People's United Financial declared a $0.1525 per share quarterly dividend, payable November 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2009. Based on the closing stock price on October 14, 2009, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 3.9 percent.
"Our third quarter performance reflects continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits in spite of a clearly very challenging economic environment," stated Philip R. Sherringham, President and Chief Executive Officer. Year-over-year core commercial and home equity lending portfolios increased eight percent and deposits grew six percent. "In addition, the pillars of our financial position  strong asset quality and prudent management of our excess capital  have served us well in these challenging times and continue to differentiate us from most in the banking sector."

Sherringham added, "We believe our asset quality has held up remarkably well on both a relative and absolute basis through the recent recessionary cycle and most of the bad news is substantially behind us. While we are well-positioned to benefit from future increases in interest rates given our asset-sensitivity, the current rate environment continues to pressure our net interest margin. Our strategic focus remains on expansion through opportunistic acquisitions even as we continue to pursue organic growth throughout our franchise. The strength of our capital and liquidity, asset quality and earnings, as well as the fact that our balance sheet remains funded almost entirely by deposits and stockholders' equity, continue to set us apart from most in the industry."
"Significant drivers of the company's performance this quarter were our first increase in the net interest margin since last year's third quarter, continued loan growth across our strategic lending businesses, improvements in fee income and expense control, partially offset by higher net loan charge-offs and our decision to increase the allowance for loan losses," said Paul D. Burner, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The 7 basis point increase in the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a reduction in our cost of deposits. In addition, during the third quarter, mortgage-backed securities with a book value of $308 million were sold, and the proceeds have been reinvested in mortgage-backed securities with substantially-equivalent maturities and yields. This investment portfolio repositioning, which was undertaken to mitigate prepayment risk, generated security gains totaling $4.8 million."
Commenting on asset quality, Burner stated, "A single shared national credit accounted for $6.1 million, or 38 percent, of this quarter's net loan charge-offs. Non-performing loans increased $7.7 million, or 5 percent, this quarter, signaling what we believe to be stabilization across the loan portfolio. Notwithstanding the slight increase in non-performing assets, our continued modest level of net loan charge-offs in this current economic environment remains a testament to our disciplined underwriting standards."
Third quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $16.0 million compared to $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.44 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 0.16 percent in this year's second quarter and were 0.26 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2009 reflects a $5.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses to $172.5 million at September 30, 2009.
At September 30, 2009, non-performing loans totaled $175.7 million and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.23 percent, compared to $168.0 million and 1.15 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2009. Non-performing assets totaled $192.7 million at September 30, 2009, a $10.7 million increase from June 30, 2009. Non-performing assets equaled 1.35 percent of total loans, REO and repossessed assets at September 30, 2009 compared to 1.25 percent at June 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.21 percent and as a percentage of non-performing loans was 98 percent, compared to 1.15 percent and 99 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2009.

Results for the first two quarters of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008 have been revised to reflect the recognition of additional non-interest expense relating to an unintentional under accrual of certain operating expenses. The effect of these revisions was immaterial to each period (no change in diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2009 and a one cent reduction in diluted earnings per share for both the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008). Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was reduced by $2.1 million, $2.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

Selected Financial Terms
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the tangible equity and efficiency ratios, and tangible book value per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares outstanding.
