Merger
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Merger Agreement by Financial Federal's stockholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of People's United and Financial Federal. Financial Federal has also agreed to call a meeting of its stockholders to consider approval of the Merger and that the Financial Federal board of directors will recommend approval of the Merger Agreement by Financial Federal's stockholders, subject to certain exceptions to permit the Financial Federal directors to comply with their fiduciary duties.
Financial Federal has generally agreed not to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions, enter into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions or approve an alternative business combination transaction. However, the Merger Agreement permits Financial Federal to take one or more of the prohibited actions referred to above, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, in response to certain unsolicited business combination proposals. If Financial Federal concludes that an alternative business combination proposal is a superior proposal, upon compliance with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement, Financial Federal may terminate the Merger Agreement (subject to its payment of the termination fee referred to below).
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both People's United and Financial Federal and, further provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, generally including an alternative business combination transaction, Financial Federal will owe People's United a cash termination fee of up to $25,830,000.
