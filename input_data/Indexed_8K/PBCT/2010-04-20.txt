The accounts identified below will pass to the Assuming Bank (unless otherwise noted). When calculating the premium to be paid on Assumed Deposits in a P&A transaction, the FDIC will exclude the following categories of deposit accounts:
 
Category Description
I Brokered Deposits
Brokered deposit accounts are accounts for which the "depositor of record" is an agent, nominee, or custodian who deposits funds for a principal or principals to whom "pass-through" deposit insurance coverage may be extended. The FDIC separates brokered deposit accounts into 2 categories: 1) Depository Organization (DO) Brokered Deposits and 2) Non-Depository Organization (Non-DO) Brokered Deposits. This distinction is made by the FDIC to facilitate our role as Receiver and Insurer. These terms will not appear on other "brokered deposit" reports generated by the institution.
Non-DO Brokered Deposits pass to the Assuming Bank, but are excluded from Assumed Deposits when the deposit premium is calculated. Please see the attached "Schedule 7 Non-DO Broker Deposit Detail Report" for a listing of these accounts. This list will be updated post closing with balances as of Bank Closing date.
DO Brokered Deposits (Cede & Co as Nominee for DTC), are typically excluded from Assumed Deposits in the P&A transaction. A list of these accounts is provided on "Schedule 2.1 DO Brokered Deposit Detail Report". If, however, the terms of a particular transaction are altered and the DO Brokered Deposits pass to the Assuming Bank, they will not be included in Assumed Deposits for purposes of calculating the deposit premium.
II CDARS
CDARS deposits pass to the Assuming Bank, but are excluded from Assumed Deposits when the deposit premium is calculated.
Butler Bank participate in the CDARS program as of the date of the deposit download. If CDARS deposits are taken between the date of the deposit download and the Bank Closing Date, they will be identified post closing and made part of Schedule 7 to the P&A Agreement.

(i) For each Single Family Shared-Loss Loan in default or for which a default is reasonably foreseeable, the Assuming Institution shall undertake reasonable and customary loss mitigation efforts, in accordance with any of the following programs selected by Assuming Institution in its sole discretion, Exhibit 5 (FDIC Mortgage Loan Modification Program), the United States Treasury's Home Affordable Modification Program Guidelines or any other modification program approved by the United States Treasury Department, the Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other governmental agency (it being understood that the Assuming Institution can select different programs for the various Single Family Shared-Loss Loans) (such program chosen, the "Modification Guidelines"). After selecting the applicable Modification Guideline for each such Single Family Shared-Loss Loan, the Assuming Institution shall document its consideration of foreclosure, loan restructuring under the applicable Modification Guideline chosen, and short-sale (if short-sale is a viable option) alternatives and shall select the alternative the Assuming Institution believes, based on its estimated calculations, will result in the least Loss. If unemployment or underemployment is the primary cause for default or for which a default is reasonably foreseeable, the Assuming Institution may consider the borrower for a temporary forbearance plan which reduces the loan payment to an affordable level for at least six (6) months.
(ii) Losses on Home Equity Loans shall be shared under the charge-off policies of the Assuming Institution's Examination Criteria as if they were Single Family Shared-Loss Loans.
(iii) Losses on Investor-Owned Residential Loans shall be treated as Restructured Loans, and with the consent of the Receiver can be restructured under terms separate from the Exhibit 5 standards. Please refer to Exhibits 2(a)(l)-(2) for guidance in Calculation of Loss for Restructured Loans. Losses on Investor-Owned Residential Loans will be treated as if they were Single Family Shared-Loss Loans.
(iv) The Assuming Institution shall retain its loss calculations for the Shared Loss Loans and such calculations shall be provided to the Receiver upon request. For the avoidance
 
of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Assuming Institution is not required to modify or restructure any Shared-Loss Loan on more than one occasion and (y) the Assuming Institution is not required to consider any alternatives with respect to any Shared-Loss Loan in the process of foreclosure as of the Bank Closing if the Assuming Institution can document that a loan modification is not cost effective and shall be entitled to continue such foreclosure measures and recover the Foreclosure Loss as provided herein, and (z) the Assuming Institution shall have a transition period of up to 90 days after Bank Closing to implement the Modification Guidelines, during which time, the Assuming Institution may submit claims under such guidelines as may be in place at the Failed Bank.
(b) .
Monthly Certificates
Not later than fifteen (15) days after the end of each Shared-Loss Month, beginning with the month in which the Commencement Date occurs and ending in the Final Shared-Loss Month, the Assuming Institution shall deliver to the Receiver a certificate, signed by an officer of the Assuming Institution involved in, or responsible for, the administration and servicing of the Shared-Loss Loans whose name appears on a list of servicing officers furnished by the Assuming Institution to the Receiver, (a "Servicing Officer") setting forth in such form and detail as the Receiver may reasonably specify (a "Monthly Certificate"):
 
(i) each Shared-Loss Loan for which a Loss Amount (calculated in accordance with the applicable Exhibit) is being claimed, the related Loss Amount for each Shared-Loss Loan, and the total Monthly Loss Amount for all Shared-Loss Loans;
(ii) each Shared-Loss Loan for which a Recovery Amount was received, the Recovery Amount for each Shared-Loss Loan, and the total Recovery Amount for all Shared-Loss Loans;
(iii) the total Monthly Loss Amount for all Shared-Loss Loans minus the total monthly Recovery Amount for all Shared-Loss Loans;
(iv) the Cumulative Shared-Loss Amount as of the beginning and end of the month;
(v) the Monthly Shared Loss Amount;
(vi) the result obtained in (v) times 80%, which is the amount to be paid under Section 2.1(d) of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement by the Receiver to the Assuming Institution if the amount is a positive number, or by the Assuming Institution to the Receiver if the amount is a negative number;
 
 
 
(c) . Not later than fifteen (15) days after the end of each month, beginning with the month in which the Commencement Date occurs and ending with the Final Shared-Loss Month, Assuming Institution shall provide Receiver:
Monthly Data Download
(i) the servicing file in machine-readable format including but not limited to the fields shown on Exhibit 2.1(c) for each outstanding Single Family Shared-Loss Loan, as applicable; and
(ii) an Excel file for ORE held as a result of foreclosure on a Single Family Shared-Loss Loan listing:
(A) Foreclosure date
(B) Unpaid loan principal balance
(C) Appraised value or BPO value, as applicable
(D) Projected liquidation date
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Assuming Institution shall not be required to provide any of the foregoing information to the extent it is unable to do so as a result of the Failed Bank's or Receiver's failure to provide information required to produce the information set forth in this Section 2.1(c); , that the Assuming Institution shall, consistent with Customary Servicing Procedures seek to produce any such missing information or improve any inaccurate information previously provided to it.
provided
(d) . After the Shared Loss Payment Trigger is reached, not later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives the Monthly Certificate, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Institution, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Monthly Shared-Loss Amount reported on the Monthly Certificate. If the total Monthly Shared-Loss Amount reported on the Monthly Certificate is a negative number, the Assuming Institution shall pay to the Receiver in immediately available funds eighty percent (80%) of that amount.
Payments With Respect to Shared-Loss Assets
(e) . The Receiver shall not be required to make any payments pursuant to Section 2.1(d) with respect to any Foreclosure Loss, Restructuring Loss, Short Sale Loss, Deficient Loss, or Portfolio Loss that the Receiver determines, based upon the criteria set forth in this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement (including the analysis and documentation requirements of Section 2.1(a)) or Customary Servicing Procedures, should not have been effected by the Assuming Institution; provided, however, (x) the Receiver must provide notice to the Assuming Institution detailing the grounds
Limitations on Shared-Loss Payment
 
for not making such payment, (y) the Receiver must provide the Assuming Institution with a reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency and (z) (1) to the extent curable, if cured, the Receiver shall make payment with respect to the properly effected Loss, and (2) to the extent not curable, shall not constitute grounds for the Receiver to withhold payment as to all other Losses (or portion of Losses) that are properly payable pursuant to the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement. In the event that the Receiver does not make any payment with respect to Losses claimed pursuant to Section 2.1(d), the Receiver and Assuming Institution shall, upon final resolution, make the necessary adjustments to the Monthly Shared-Loss Amount for that Monthly Certificate and the payment pursuant to Section 2.1(d) above shall be adjusted accordingly.
(f) . All payments under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement shall be made by wire-transfer in accordance with the wire-transfer instructions on Exhibit 4.
Payments by Wire-Transfer
(g) . On the date that is 45 days following the last day (such day, the "True-Up Measurement Date") of the Final Shared Loss Month, or upon the final disposition of all Shared Loss Assets under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement at any time after the termination of the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, the Assuming Institution shall pay to the Receiver fifty percent (50%) of the excess, if any, of (i) twenty percent (20%) of the Intrinsic Loss Estimate less (ii) the sum of (A) twenty-five percent (25%) of the asset premium (discount) plus (B) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Cumulative Shared-Loss Payments plus (C) the Cumulative Servicing Amount. The Assuming Institution shall deliver to the Receiver not later than 30 days following the True-Up Measurement Date, a schedule, signed by an officer of the Assuming Institution, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Cumulative Shared-Loss Payments and the Cumulative Servicing Amount.
Payment in the Event Losses Fail to Reach Expected Level
(h) . Payments from the Receiver with respect to this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement are administrative expenses of the Receiver. To the extent the Receiver needs funds for shared-loss payments respect to this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, the Receiver shall request funds under the Master Loan and Security Agreement, as amended ("MLSA"), from FDIC in its corporate capacity. The Receiver will not agree to any amendment of the MLSA that would prevent the Receiver from drawing on the MLSA to fund shared-loss payments.
Payments as Administrative Expenses
2.2
Auditor Report; Right to Audit.
(a) Within the time period permitted for the examination audit pursuant to 12 CFR Section 363 after the end of each fiscal year during which the Receiver makes any payment to the Assuming Institution under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, the Assuming Institution shall deliver to the Receiver a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that they have reviewed the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement and that, in the course of their annual audit of the Assuming Institution's books and records, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Institution during such fiscal year pursuant to this Article LI were not made by the Assuming Institution in accordance herewith. In the event that the Assuming Institution cannot comply with
 
the preceding sentence, it shall promptly submit to the Receiver corrected computations together with a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that, after giving effect to such corrected computations, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Institution during such year pursuant to this Article II were not made by the Assuming Institution in accordance herewith. In such event, the Assuming Institution and the Receiver shall make all such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give effect to each correction reflected in such corrected computations, retroactive to the date on which the corresponding incorrect computation was made.
(b) The Assuming Institution shall perform on an annual basis an internal audit of its compliance with the provisions of this Article II and shall provide the Receiver and the Corporation with copies of the internal audit reports and access to internal audit workpapers related to such internal audit.
(c) The Receiver or the FDIC in its corporate capacity ("Corporation"), its contractors and their employees, and its agents may perform an audit or audits to determine the Assuming Institution's compliance with the provisions of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, including this Article II, by providing not less than ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice. Assuming Institution shall provide access to pertinent records and proximate working space in Assuming Institution's facilities. The scope and duration of any such audit shall be within the reasonable discretion of the Receiver or the Corporation, but shall in no event be administered in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Assuming Institution's business. The Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall bear the expense of any such audit. In the event that any corrections are necessary as a result of such an audit or audits, the Assuming Institution and the Receiver shall make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections.
. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article II, the Receiver, upon the direction of the Director (or designee) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, may withhold payment for any amounts included in a Monthly Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.1, if in its good faith and reasonable judgment there is a reasonable basis under the requirements of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement for denying the eligibility of an item for which reimbursement or payment is sought under such Section. In such event, the Receiver shall provide a written notice to the Assuming Institution detailing the grounds for withholding such payment. At such time as the Assuming Institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Receiver, in its reasonable judgment, that the grounds for such withholding of payment, or portion of payment, no longer exist or have been cured, then the Receiver shall pay the Assuming Institution the amount withheld which the Receiver determines is eligible for payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days.
2.3
Withholdings
. The Assuming Institution shall at all times during the term of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement keep books and records sufficient to ensure and document compliance with the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, including but not limited to (a) documentation of alternatives considered with respect to defaulted loans or loans for which default is reasonably foreseeable, (b) documentation showing the calculation of loss for claims submitted to the Receiver, (c) retention of documents that support each line item on the loss claim forms, and (d) documentation with respect to the Recovery Amount on loans for which the Receiver has made a loss-share payment.
2.4
Books and Records
 
. The Assuming Institution shall promptly provide to the Receiver such other information, including but not limited to, financial statements, computations, and bank policies and procedures, relating to the performance of the provisions of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, as the Receiver may reasonably request from time to time.
2.5
Information
. The Assuming Institution shall not at any time, without the Receiver's prior written consent, seek a private letter ruling or other determination from the Internal Revenue Service or otherwise seek to qualify for any special tax treatment or benefits associated with any payments made by the Receiver pursuant to this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement.
2.6
Tax Ruling
. The Receiver shall be relieved of its obligations with respect to a Shared-Loss Loan upon payment of a Foreclosure Loss amount, or a Short Sale Loss amount with respect to such Single Family Shared-Loss Loan, or upon the sale without FDIC consent of a Single Family Shared-Loss Loan by Assuming Institution to a person or entity that is not an Affiliate. The Assuming Institution shall provide the Receiver with timely notice of any such sale. Failure to administer any Shared-Loss Loan or Loans in accordance with Article III shall at the discretion of the Receiver constitute grounds for the loss of shared loss coverage with respect to such Shared-Loss Loan or Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a sale of the Single Family Shared-Loss Loan, for purposes of this Section 2.7, shall not be deemed to have occurred as the result of (i) any change in the ownership or control of Assuming Institution or the transfer of any or all of the Single Family Shared-Loss Loan(s) to any Affiliate of Assuming Institution, (ii) a merger by Assuming Institution with or into any other entity, or (iii) a sale by Assuming Institution of all or substantially all of its assets.
2.7
Loss of Shared-Loss Coverage on Shared-Loss Loans
. The Assuming Institution shall (and shall cause any of its Affiliates to which the Assuming Institution transfers any Shared-Loss Loans to) manage, administer, and collect the Shared-Loss Loans while owned by the Assuming Institution or any Affiliate thereof during the term of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement in accordance with the rules set forth in this Article III. The Assuming Institution shall be responsible to the Receiver in the performance of its duties hereunder and shall provide to the Receiver such reports as the Receiver reasonably deems advisable, including but not limited to the reports required by Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 3.3 hereof, and shall permit the Receiver to monitor the Assuming Institution's performance of its duties hereunder.

3.2
Duties of the Assuming Institution
(a) In the performance of its duties under this Article III, the Assuming Institution shall:
(i) manage and administer each Shared-Loss Loan in accordance with Assuming Institution's usual and prudent business and banking practices and Customary Servicing Procedures;
 
(ii) exercise its best business judgment in managing, administering and collecting amounts owed on the Shared-Loss Loans;
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize Recoveries with respect to Losses on Shared-Loss Loans without regard to the effect of maximizing collections on assets held by the Assuming Institution or any of its Affiliates that are not Shared-Loss Loans;
(iv) retain sufficient staff (in Assuming Institution's discretion) to perform its duties hereunder; and
(v) other than as provided in Section 2.1(a), comply with the terms of the Modification Guidelines for any Single Family Shared-Loss Loans meeting the requirements set forth therein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Assuming Institution may propose exceptions to Exhibit 5 (the FDIC Loan Modification Program) for a group of Loans with similar characteristics, with the objectives of (1) minimizing the loss to the Assuming Institution and the FDIC and (2) maximizing the opportunity for qualified homeowners to remain in their homes with affordable mortgage payments.
(b) Any transaction with or between any Affiliate of the Assuming Institution with respect to any Shared-Loss Loan including, without limitation, the execution of any contract pursuant to which any Affiliate of the Assuming Institution will manage, administer or collect any of the Shared-Loss Loans will be provided to FDIC for informational purposes and if such transaction is not entered into on an arm's length basis on commercially reasonable terms such transaction shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Receiver.
. The Assuming Institution shall establish and maintain such records as may be appropriate to account for the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans in such form and detail as the Receiver may reasonably require, and to enable the Assuming Institution to prepare and deliver to the Receiver such reports as the Receiver may from time to time request regarding the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans and the Monthly Certificates required by Section 2.1 of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement.

Related Loans
(a) Assuming Institution shall use its best efforts to determine which loans are "Related Loans," as hereinafter defined. The Assuming Institution shall not manage, administer or collect any "Related Loan" in any manner that would have the effect of increasing the amount of any collections with respect to the Related Loan to the detriment of the Shared-Loss Loan to which such loan is related. A "Related Loan" means any loan or extension of credit to an Obligor of a Shared-Loss Loan held by the Assuming Institution at any time on or prior to the end of the Final Shared-Loss Month.
(b) The Assuming Institution shall prepare and deliver to the Receiver with the Monthly Certificates for the calendar months ending June 30 and December 31, a schedule of all Related Loans on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Institution as of the end of each such semi-annual period.
. The Assuming

Institution shall notify the Receiver in writing (such notice to be given in accordance with Article V below and to include all relevant details) prior to utilizing in any legal action any special legal power or right which the Assuming Institution derives as a result of having acquired an asset from the Receiver, and the Assuming Institution shall not utilize any such power unless the Receiver shall have consented in writing to the proposed usage. The Receiver shall have the right to direct such proposed usage by the Assuming Institution and the Assuming Institution shall comply in all respects with such direction. Upon request of the Receiver, the Assuming Institution will advise the Receiver as to the status of any such legal action. The Assuming Institution shall immediately notify the Receiver of any judgment in litigation involving any of the aforesaid special powers or rights.
. The Assuming Institution may perform any of its obligations and/or exercise any of its rights under this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement through or by one or more Third Party Servicers, who may take actions and make expenditures as if any such Third Party Servicer was the Assuming Institution hereunder (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such expenses incurred by any such Third Party Servicer on behalf of the Assuming Institution shall be included in calculating Losses to the extent such expenses would be included in such calculation if the expenses were incurred by Assuming Institution); provided, however, that the use thereof by the Assuming Institution shall not release the Assuming Institution of any obligation or liability hereunder.
3.6
Third Party Servicer
. The Assuming Institution shall have the right, with the consent of the Receiver, to liquidate for cash consideration, from time to time in one or more transactions, all or a portion of Shared-Loss Loans held by the Assuming Institution at any time prior to the Termination Date ("Portfolio Sales"). If the Assuming Institution exercises its option under this Section 4.1, it must give sixty (60) days notice in writing to the Receiver setting forth the details and schedule for the Portfolio Sale, which shall be conducted by means of sealed bid sales to third parties, not including any of the Assuming Institution's affiliates, contractors, or any affiliates of the Assuming Institution's contractors. Sales of Restructured Loans shall be sold in a separate pool from Shared-Loss Loans that have not been restructured. Other proposals for the sale of a Shared-Loss Loan or Shared-Loss Loans submitted by the Assuming Institution will be considered by the Receiver on a case-by-case basis.
4.1
Assuming Institution Portfolio Sales of Remaining Shared-Loss Loans
. In the event that the Assuming Institution does not conduct a Portfolio Sale pursuant to Section 4.1, the Receiver shall have the right, exercisable in its sole and absolute discretion, to require the Assuming Institution to liquidate for cash consideration, any Shared-Loss Loans held by the Assuming Institution at any time after the date that is six months prior to the Termination Date. If the Receiver exercises its option under this Section 4.2, it must give notice in writing to the Assuming Institution, setting forth the time period within which the Assuming Institution shall be required to liquidate the Shared-Loss Loans. The Assuming Institution will comply with the Receiver's notice and must liquidate the Shared-Loss Loans as soon as reasonably practicable by means of sealed bid sales to third parties, not including any of the Assuming Institution's affiliates, contractors, or any affiliates of the Assuming Institution's contractors. The selection of

Assuming Institution's Liquidation of Remaining Shared-Loss Loans
 
any financial advisor or other third party broker or sales agent retained for the liquidation of the remaining Shared-Loss Loans pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the prior approval of the Receiver, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
. For Shared-Loss Loans that are not Restructured Loans, gain or loss on the sales under Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 will be calculated as the sale price received by the Assuming Institution less the unpaid principal balance of the remaining Shared-Loss Loans. For any Restructured Loan included in the sale gain or loss on sale will be calculated as (a) the sale price received by the Assuming Institution less (b) the net present value of estimated cash flows on the Restructured Loan that was used in the calculation of the related Restructuring Loss plus (c) Loan principal payments collected by the Assuming Institution from the date the Loan was restructured to the date of sale. (See Exhibits 2d(l)-(2) for example calculations).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement, except as is expressly permitted in this Section 6.2, Assuming Institution may not assign or otherwise transfer this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement (in whole or in part) without the prior written consent of the Receiver, which consent may be granted or withheld by the Receiver in its sole discretion, and any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be void . For the avoidance of doubt, a merger or consolidation of the Assuming Institution with and into another financial institution, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Assuming Institution to another financial institution constitutes the transfer of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement which requires the consent of the Receiver; and for a period of thirty-six (36) months after Bank Closing, a merger or consolidation shall also include the sale by any one or more shareholders acting in concert, of more than nine percent (9%) of the outstanding Shares of the Assuming Institution, or of its Holding Company, or of any subsidiary holding Shared-Loss Assets, or the sale of Shares by the Assuming Institution or its Holding Company or any subsidiary holding Shared-Loss Assets, in a public or private offering, that increases the number of Shares outstanding by more than 9% and after issuance results in a change of shareholder interest of more than 9%, constitutes the transfer of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement which requires the consent of the Receiver. No Loss shall be recognized as a result of any accounting adjustments that are made due to any such merger, consolidation or sale consented to by the FDIC.

Dispute Resolution Procedures
(a) In the event a dispute arises about the interpretation, application, calculation of Loss, or calculation of payments or otherwise with respect to this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement ("SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item"), then the Receiver and the Assuming Institution shall make every attempt in good faith to resolve such items within sixty (60) days following the receipt of a written description of the SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, with notification of the possibility of taking the matter to arbitration (the date on which such 60-day period expires, or any extension of such period as the parties hereto may mutually agree to in writing, herein called the "Resolution Deadline Date"). If the Receiver and the Assuming Institution resolve all such items to their mutual satisfaction by the Resolution Deadline Date, then within thirty (30) days following such resolution, any payment due as a result of such resolution shall be made arising from the settlement of the SF Shared-Loss Dispute.
(b) If the Receiver and the Assuming Institution fail to resolve any outstanding SF Shared-Loss Dispute Items by the Resolution Deadline Date, then either party may notify the other of its intent to submit the SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration pursuant to the provisions of this Article VII. Failure of either party to submit pursuant to paragraph (c) hereof any unresolved SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration within thirty (30) days following the Resolution Deadline Date (the date on which such thirty (30) day period expires is herein called the "Arbitration Deadline Date") shall extinguish that party's right to submit the non-submitted SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item to arbitration, and constitute a waiver of the submitting party's right to dispute such non-submitted SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item (but not a waiver of any similar claim which may arise in the future).
 
(c) If a SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item is submitted to arbitration, it shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), except as otherwise provided herein. Either party may submit a matter for arbitration by delivering a notice, prior to the Arbitration Deadline Date, to the other party in writing setting forth:
(i) A brief description of each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration;
(ii) A statement of the moving party's position with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration;
(iii) The value sought by the moving party, or other relief requested regarding each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item submitted for arbitration, to the extent reasonably calculable; and
(iv) The name and address of the arbiter selected by the moving party (the "Moving Arbiter"), who shall be a neutral, as determined by the AAA.
Failure to adequately include any information above shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the parties right to arbitrate so long as after notification of such failure the moving party cures such failure as promptly as reasonably practicable.
(d) The non-moving party shall, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a notice of arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.1, deliver a notice to the moving party setting forth:
(i) The name and address of the arbiter selected by the non-moving party (the "Respondent Arbiter"), who shall be a neutral, as determined by the AAA;
(ii) A statement of the position of the respondent with respect to each Dispute Item; and
(iii) The ultimate resolution sought by the respondent or other relief, if any, the respondent deems is due the moving party with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item.
Failure to adequately include any information above shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the non-moving party's right to defend such arbitration so long as after notification of such failure the non-moving party cures such failure as promptly as reasonably practicable
(e) The Moving Arbiter and Respondent Arbiter shall select a third arbiter from a list furnished by the AAA. In accordance with the rules of the AAA, the three (3) arbiters shall constitute the arbitration panel for resolution of each SF Loss-Share Dispute Item. The concurrence of any two (2) arbiters shall be deemed to be the decision of the arbiters for all purposes hereunder. The arbitration shall proceed on such time schedule and in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the AAA then in effect, as modified by this Section 7.1. The arbitration proceedings shall take place at such location as the parties thereto may mutually agree, but if they cannot agree, then they will take place at the offices of the Corporation in Washington, DC, or Arlington, Virginia.
(f) The Receiver and Assuming Institution shall facilitate the resolution of each
 
outstanding SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item by making available in a prompt and timely manner to one another and to the arbiters for examination and copying, as appropriate, all documents, books, and records under their respective control and that would be discoverable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(g) The arbiters designated pursuant to subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof shall select, with respect to each Dispute Item submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.1, either (i) the position and relief submitted by the Assuming Institution with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, or (ii) the position and relief submitted by the Receiver with respect to each SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item, in either case as set forth in its respective notice of arbitration. The arbiters shall have no authority to select a value for each Dispute Item other than the determination set forth in Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.1(d). The arbitration shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.
(h) Any amounts ultimately determined to be payable pursuant to such award shall bear interest at the Settlement Interest Rate from and including the date specified for the arbiters decisions specified in this Section 7.1, without regard to any extension of the finality of such award, to but not including the date paid. All payments required to be made under this Section 7.1 shall be made by wire transfer.
(i) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any notice of a SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item(s) is provided prior to the Termination Date, the terms of this Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to the Single Family Shared-Loss Loans that are the subject of such SF Shared-Loss Dispute Item(s) until such time as any such dispute is finally resolved.
. The aggregate fees and expenses of the arbiters shall be borne equally by the parties. The parties shall pay the aggregate fees and expenses within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written decision of the arbiters (unless the arbiters agree in writing on some other payment schedule).

Objective
The objective of this FDIC Mortgage Loan Modification Program ("Program") is to modify the terms of certain residential mortgage loans so as to improve affordability, increase the probability of performance, allow borrowers to remain in their homes and increase the value of the loans to the FDIC and assignees. The Program provides for the modification of Qualifying Loans (as defined below) by reducing the borrower's monthly housing debt to income ratio ("DTI Ratio") to no more than 31% at the time of the modification and eliminating adjustable interest rate and negative amortization features.
Qualifying Mortgage Loans
In order for a mortgage loan to be a Qualifying Loan it must meet all of the following criteria, which must be confirmed by the lender:
 
 
 
Modification Process
The lender shall undertake a review of its mortgage loan portfolio to identify Qualifying Loans. For each Qualifying Loan, the lender shall determine the net present value of the modified loan and, if it will exceed the net present value of the foreclosed collateral upon disposition, then the Qualifying Loan shall be modified so as to reduce the borrower's monthly DTI Ratio to no more than 31% at the time of the modification. To achieve this, the lender shall use a combination of interest rate reduction, term extension and principal forbearance, as necessary.
The borrower's monthly DTI Ratio shall be a percentage calculated by dividing the borrower's monthly income by the borrower's monthly housing payment (including principal, interest, taxes and insurance). For these purpose of the foregoing calculation:
(1) the borrower's monthly income shall be defined as the borrower's (along with any co-borrowers') income amount before any payroll deductions and includes wages and salaries, overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips, bonuses, housing allowances, other compensation for personal services, Social Security payments, including Social Security received by adults on behalf of minors or by minors intended for their own support, and monthly income from annuities, insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, disability or death benefits, unemployment benefits, rental income and other income. All income information must be documented and verified. If the borrower receives public assistance or collects unemployment, the Assuming Institution must determine whether the public assistance or unemployment income will continue for at least nine (9) months.
(2) the borrower's monthly housing payment shall be the amount required to pay monthly principal and interest plus one-twelfth of the then current annual amount required to pay real property taxes and homeowner's insurance with respect to the collateral.
 
In order to calculate the monthly principal payment, the lender shall capitalize to the outstanding principal balance of the Qualifying Loan the amount of all delinquent interest, delinquent taxes, past due insurance premiums, third party fees and (without duplication) escrow advances (such amount, the "Capitalized Balance").
In order to achieve the goal of reducing the DTI Ratio to 31%, the lender shall take the following steps in the following order of priority with respect to each Qualifying Loan:
 
 
 
 
Special Note:
The net present value calculation used to determine whether a loan should be modified based on the modification process above is distinct and different from the net present value calculation used to determine the covered loss if the loan is modified. Please refer only to the net present value calculation described in this exhibit for the modification process, with its separate assumptions, when determining whether to provide a modification to a borrower. Separate assumptions may include, without limitation, Assuming Institution's determination of a probability of default without modification, a probability of default with modification, home price forecasts, prepayment speeds, and event timing. These assumptions are applied to different projected cash flows over the term of the loan, such as the projected cash flow of the loan performing or defaulting without modification and the projected cash flow of the loan performing or defaulting with modification.
By contrast, the net present value for determining the covered loss is based on a 10 year period. While the assumptions in the net present value calculation used in the modification process may change, the net present value calculation for determining the covered loss remains constant.
 
Related Junior Lien Mortgage Loans
In cases where the lender holds a junior lien mortgage loan that is collateralized by the same property that collateralizes a Qualifying Loan that is modified as described above, the junior lien mortgage loan shall also be modified to enhance overall affordability to the borrower. At a minimum, the lender shall reduce the interest rate on the junior lien mortgage loan to no more than 2% per annum. Further modifications may be made at the lender's discretion as needed to support affordability and performance of the modified first lien Qualifying Loan.
 
This agreement for reimbursement of loss sharing expenses on certain loans and other assets (the "Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement") shall apply when the Assuming Institution purchases Shared-Loss Assets as that term is defined herein. The terms hereof shall modify and supplement, as necessary, the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement to which this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4.15B and incorporated therein.

If the amount of all Net Charge-Offs during any Shared-Loss Quarter Reimbursable Expenses, SLS Net Realized Gain and SLS Net Realized Loss, the OTTI Adjustment during such Shared-Loss Quarter (the "Shared-Loss Amount") is positive, then, except as provided in Sections 2.1(c) and (e) below, and subject to the provisions of Section 2. l(b)(vi) below, not later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives the Quarterly Certificate with respect to such Shared-Loss Quarter, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Institution an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Shared-Loss Amount for such Shared-Loss Quarter. If the Shared-Loss Amount during any Shared-Loss Quarter is negative, the Assuming Institution shall pay to the Receiver an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Shared-Loss Amount for such Shared-Loss Quarter, which payment shall be delivered to the Receiver together with the Quarterly Certificate for such Shared-Loss Quarter.

(iii) With respect to each Shared-Loss Quarter and Recovery Quarter, collections by or on behalf of the Assuming Institution on any charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing on an Asset other than a Shared-Loss Asset or Shared-Loss Securities shall be reported as Recoveries under this Section 2.1 only to the extent such collections exceed the Book Value of such Asset, if any. For any Shared-Loss Quarter or Recovery Quarter in which collections by or on behalf of the Assuming Institution on such Asset are applied to both Book Value and to a charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing, the amount of expenditures incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Institution attributable to the collection of any such Asset, that shall be considered a Reimbursable Expense or a Recovery Expense under this Section 2.1 will be limited to a proportion of such expenditures which is equal to the proportion derived by dividing (A) the amount of collections on such Asset applied to a charge-off effected by the Failed Bank prior to Bank Closing, by (B) the total collections on such Assets. With respect to Assets that were completely charged off by the Failed Bank and had a zero Book Value at Bank Closing, for the purpose of calculating the payments under this Section 2.1(b) for Recoveries on those Assets for each such quarter, the Assuming Institution shall pay an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Recoveries on Failed Bank Charge-Offs/Write-Downs with respect to such Assets, and shall separately account for the other computations on those Recoveries under this Section 2.1(b) using fifty percent (50%) (and not eighty percent (80%)).
 
(iv) If the Assuming Institution has duly specified an amount of Reimbursable Expenses on the Quarterly Certificate for the first Recovery Quarter as described above in Section 2.1(a)(ii)(E), then, not later than fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Receiver receives that Quarterly Certificate, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Institution an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the amount of such Reimbursable Expenses.
(v) If the First Loss Tranche as determined under the Purchase and Assumption Agreement is a positive number, Receiver has no obligation to make payment for any Shared Loss Quarters until the Shared -Loss Payment Trigger is satisfied.
(vi) Payments from the Receiver with respect to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement are administrative expenses of the Receiver. To the extent the Receiver needs funds for shared-loss payments respect to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, the Receiver shall request funds under the Master Loan and Security Agreement, as amended ("MLSA"), from FDIC in its corporate capacity. The Receiver will not agree to any amendment of the MLSA that would prevent the Receiver from drawing on the MLSA to fund shared-loss payments.
The Receiver shall not be required to make any payments pursuant to this Section 2.1 with respect to any Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset that the Receiver or the Corporation determines, based upon the Examination Criteria, should not have been effected by the Assuming Institution; provided, (x) the Receiver must provide notice to the Assuming Institution detailing the grounds for not making such payment, (y) the Receiver must provide the Assuming Institution with a reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency and (z) (1) to the extent curable, if cured, the Receiver shall make payment with respect to any properly effected Charge-Off and (2) to the extent not curable, the Receiver shall make a payment as to all Charge-Offs (or portion of Charge-Offs) that were effected which would have been payable as a Charge-Off if the Assuming Institution had properly effected such Charge-Off. In the event that the Receiver does not make any payments with respect to any Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1 or determines that a payment was improperly made, the Assuming Institution and the Receiver shall, upon final resolution, make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections. Failure to administer any Shared-Loss Asset or Assets, or Shared-Loss Securities, in accordance with Article III shall at the discretion of the Receiver constitute grounds for the loss of shared loss coverage with respect to such Shared-Loss Loan or Loans.
(c) .
Limitation on Shared-Loss Payment
No Shared-Loss Loan shall be treated as a Shared-Loss Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1 (i) if the Assuming Institution sells or otherwise transfers such Shared-Loss Loan or any interest therein (whether with or without recourse) to any Person, (ii) after the Assuming Institution makes any additional advance, commitment or increase in the amount of a commitment with respect to such Shared-Loss Loan that does not constitute a Permitted Advance or a Shared-Loss Loan Commitment Advance, (iii) after the Assuming Institution makes any amendment, modification, renewal or extension to such Shared-Loss Loan that does not constitute a Permitted Amendment, or (iv) after the Assuming Institution has managed, administered or collected any "Related Loan" (as such term is defined in Section 3.4 of Article III of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement) in any manner which would have the effect of increasing the amount of any collections with respect to the Related Loan to the detriment of such Shared-Loss Asset to which such loan is related; , any such Shared-Loss Loan that has been the subject of Charge-Offs prior to the taking of any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 2.1(d) by the Assuming Institution shall be treated as a Shared-Loss Asset pursuant to this Section 2.1 solely for the purpose of treatment of Recoveries on such Charge-Offs until such time as the amount of Recoveries with respect to such Shared-Loss Asset equals such Charge-Offs.

(Where the Assuming Institution determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the previously mentioned situation exists with respect to continued efforts to collect a Shared-Loss Asset or an Asset for which a charge-off was effected by the Failed Bank with, in either case, a Legal Balance of less than $1,000,000 on the Accounting Records of the Assuming Institution, the Assuming Institution may so notify the Receiver and request that such expenditure be treated as a Reimbursable Expense or Recovery Expense.) Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such a notice, the Receiver will advise the Assuming Institution of its consent or denial, that such expenditures shall be treated as a Reimbursable Expense or Recovery Expense, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the failure of the Receiver to give its consent with respect to such expenditures, the Assuming Institution shall continue to administer such Shared-Loss Asset in accordance with Section 2.2, except that the Assuming Institution shall not be required to make such expenditures. At any time after its receipt of such a notice and on or prior to the Termination Date the Receiver shall have the right to purchase such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset as provided in Section 2.1(e)(iii), notwithstanding any consent by the Receiver with respect to such expenditure.
(ii) During the period prior to the Termination Date, the Assuming Institution shall notify the Receiver within fifteen (15) days after any of the following becomes fully or partially charged-off:
(A) a Shared-Loss Loan having a Legal Balance (or, in the case of more than one (1) Shared-Loss Loan made to the same Obligor, a combined Legal Balance) of $5,000,000 or more in circumstances in which the legal claim against the relevant Obligor survives; or
(B) a Shared-Loss Loan to a director, an "executive officer" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(d), a "principal shareholder" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(1), or an Affiliate of the Assuming Institution.
During the period prior to the Termination Date, the Assuming Institution shall notify the Receiver within fifteen (15) days after any complete or partial charge-off of a Shared-Loss Loan to a director, an "executive officer" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(d), a "principal shareholder" as defined in 12 C.F.R. 215.2(1), or an Affiliate of the Assuming Institution.
(iii) If the Receiver determines in its discretion that the Assuming Institution is not diligently pursuing collection efforts with respect to any Shared-Loss Asset which has been fully or partially charged-off or written-down (including any Shared-Loss Asset which is identified or required to be identified in a notice pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(ii)) or any Asset for which there exists a Failed Bank Charge-Off/Write-Down, the Receiver may at its option, exercisable at any time on or prior to the Termination Date, require the Assuming Institution to assign, transfer and convey such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset to and for the sole benefit of the Receiver for a price equal to the Shared-Loss Asset Repurchase Price thereof less the Related Liability Amount with respect to any Related Liabilities related to such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset.
 
(iv) Not later than ten (10) days after the date upon which the Assuming Institution receives notice of the Receiver's intention to purchase or require the assignment of any Shared-Loss Asset or Asset pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(i) or (iii), the Assuming Institution shall transfer to the Receiver such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset and any Credit Files relating thereto and shall take all such other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to adequately effect the transfer of such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset from the Assuming Institution to the Receiver. Not later than fifteen (15) days after the date upon which the Receiver receives such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset and any Credit Files relating thereto, the Receiver shall pay to the Assuming Institution an amount equal to the Shared-Loss Asset Repurchase Price of such Shared-Loss Asset or Asset less the Related Liability Amount.
(v) The Receiver shall assume all Related Liabilities with respect to any Shared-Loss Asset or Asset set forth in the notice described in Section 2.1 (e)(iv).

Dispute Resolution
(i) (A) Any dispute as to whether a Charge-Off of a Shared-Loss Asset was made in accordance with Examination Criteria shall be resolved by the Assuming Institution's Chartering Authority. (B) With respect to any other dispute arising under the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement which the parties hereto cannot resolve after having negotiated such matter, in good faith, for a thirty (30) day period, other than a dispute the Corporation is not permitted to submit to arbitration under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 ("ADRA"), as amended, such other dispute shall be resolved by determination of a review board (a "Review Board") established pursuant to Section 2.1(f). Any Review Board under this Section 2.1(f) shall follow the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act and shall follow the provisions of the ADRA. (C) Any determination by the Assuming Institution's Chartering Authority or by a Review Board shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to further dispute, and judgment may be entered on said determination in accordance with applicable arbitration law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
(ii) A Review Board shall consist of three (3) members, each of whom shall have such expertise as the Corporation and the Assuming Institution agree is relevant. As appropriate, the Receiver or the Corporation (the "FDIC Party") will select one member, one member will be selected by the Assuming Institution and the third member (the "Neutral Member") will be selected by the other two members. The member of the Review Board selected by a party may be removed at any time by such party upon two (2) days' written notice to the other party of the selection of a replacement member. The Neutral Member may be removed by unanimous action of the members appointed by the FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution after two (2) days' prior written notice to the FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution of the selection of a replacement Neutral Member. In addition, if a Neutral Member fails for any reason to serve or continue to serve on the Review Board, the other remaining members shall so notify the parties to the dispute and the Neutral Member in writing that such Neutral Member will be replaced, and the Neutral Member shall thereafter be replaced by the unanimous action of the other remaining members within twenty (20) business days of that notification.
(iii) No dispute may be submitted to a Review Board by any of the parties to this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement unless such party has provided to the other party a written notice of dispute ("Notice of Dispute"). During the forty-five (45)-day period following the providing of a Notice of Dispute, the parties to the dispute will make every effort in good faith to resolve the dispute by mutual agreement. As part of these good faith efforts, the parties should consider the use of less formal dispute
 
resolution techniques, as judged appropriate by each party in its sole discretion. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, mediation, settlement conference, and early neutral evaluation. If the parties have not agreed to a resolution of the dispute by the end of such forty-five (45)-day period, then, subject to the discretion of the Corporation and the written consent of the Assuming Institution as set forth in Section 2.1(f)(i)(B) above, on the first day following the end of such period, the FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution shall notify each other of its selection of its member of the Review Board and such members shall be instructed to promptly select the Neutral Member of the Review Board. If the members appointed by the FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution are unable to promptly agree upon the initial selection of the Neutral Member, or a timely replacement Neutral Member as set forth in Section 2.1(f)(ii) above, the two appointed members shall apply to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and such Neutral Member shall be appointed in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA.
(iv) The resolution of a dispute pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA to the extent that such rules are not inconsistent with this Section 2.1(f). The Review Board may modify the procedures set forth in such rules from time to time with the prior approval of the FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution.
(v) Within fifteen (15) days after the last to occur of the final written submissions of both parties, the presentation of witnesses, if any, and oral presentations, if any, the Review Board shall adopt the position of one of the parties and shall present to the parties a written award regarding the dispute. The determination of any two (2) members of a Review Board will constitute the determination of such Review Board.
(vi) The FDIC Party and the Assuming Institution will each pay the fees and expenses of the member of the Review Board selected by it. The FDIC Party and Assuming Institution will share equally the fees and expenses of the Neutral Member. No such fees or expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Institution shall be subject to reimbursement by the FDIC Party under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement or otherwise.
(vii) Each party will bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the submission of any dispute to a Review Board. No such costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Assuming Institution shall be subject to reimbursement by the FDIC Party under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement or otherwise. The Review Board shall have no authority to award costs or expenses incurred by either party to these proceedings.
(viii) Any dispute resolution proceeding held pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall not be public. In addition, each party and each member of any Review Board shall strictly maintain the confidentiality of all issues, disputes, arguments, positions and interpretations of any such proceeding, as well as all information, attachments, enclosures, exhibits, summaries, compilations, studies, analyses, notes, documents, statements, schedules and other similar items associated therewith, except as the parties agree in writing or such disclosure is required pursuant to law, rule or regulation. Pursuant to ADRA, dispute resolution communications may not be disclosed either by the parties or by any member of the Review board unless:
(1) all parties to the dispute resolution proceeding agree in writing;
(2) the communication has already been made public;
(3) the communication is required by statute, rule or regulation to be made public; or
(4) a court determines that such testimony or disclosure is necessary to prevent a manifest injustice, help establish a violation of the law or prevent harm to the public health or safety, or
 
of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of parties in future cases that their communications will remain confidential.
(ix) Any dispute resolution proceeding pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) (whether as a matter of good faith negotiations, by resort to a Review Board, or otherwise) is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence. The parties agree that all proceedings, including any statement made or document prepared by any party, attorney or other participants are privileged and shall not be disclosed in any subsequent proceeding or document or construed for any purpose as an admission against interest. Any document submitted and any statements made during any dispute resolution proceeding are for settlement purposes only. The parties further agree not to subpoena any of the members of the Review Board or any documents submitted to the Review Board. In no event will the Neutral Member voluntarily testify on behalf of any party.
(x) No decision, interpretation, determination, analysis, statement, award or other pronouncement of any Review Board shall constitute precedent as regards any subsequent proceeding (whether or not such proceeding involves dispute resolution under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement) nor shall any Review Board be bound to follow any decision, interpretation, determination, analysis, statement, award or other pronouncement rendered by any previous Review Board or any other previous dispute resolution panel which may have convened in connection with a transaction involving other failed financial institutions or Federal assistance transactions.
(xi) The parties may extend any period of time in this Section 2.1 (f) by mutual agreement. Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, no dispute shall be submitted to a Review Board until each member of the Review Board, and any substitute member, if applicable, agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.1(f) as applicable to members of a Review Board. Prior to the commencement of the Review Board proceedings, or, in the case of a substitute Neutral Member, prior to the re-commencement of such proceedings subsequent to that substitution, the Neutral Member shall provide a written oath of impartiality.
(xii) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any notice of dispute is provided to a party under this Section 2.1(g) prior to the Termination Date, the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to any such items set forth in such notice until such time as any such dispute with respect to such item is finally resolved.
On the date that is 45 days following the last day (such day, the "True-Up Measurement Date") of the calendar month in which the tenth anniversary of the calendar day following the Bank Closing occurs, or upon the final disposition of all Shared Loss Assets under the Single Family Shared-Loss Agreement at any time after the termination of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, the Assuming Institution shall pay to the Receiver fifty percent (50%) of the excess, if any, of (i) twenty percent (20%) of the Intrinsic Loss Estimate less (ii) the sum of (A) twenty-five percent (25%) of the asset premium (discount) plus (B) twenty-five percent (25%) of the Cumulative Shared-Loss Payments plus (C) the Cumulative Servicing Amount. The Assuming Institution shall deliver to the Receiver not later than 30 days following the True-Up Measurement Date, a schedule, signed by an officer of the Assuming Institution, setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Cumulative Shared-Loss Payments and the Cumulative Servicing Amount.

Auditor Report; Right to Audit.
(a) Within the time period permitted for the examination audit pursuant to 12 CFR Section 363 after the end of each fiscal year from and including the fiscal year during which Bank Closing falls to and including the calendar year during which the Termination Date falls, the Assuming Institution shall deliver to the Corporation and to the Receiver a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that they have reviewed the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement and that, in the course of their annual audit of the Assuming Institution's books and records, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Institution during such year by this Article II were not made by the Assuming Institution in accordance herewith. In the event that the Assuming Institution cannot comply with the preceding sentence, it shall promptly submit to the Receiver corrected computations together with a report signed by its independent public accountants stating that, after giving effect to such corrected computations, nothing has come to their attention suggesting that any computations required to be made by the Assuming Institution during such year by this Article II were not made by the Assuming Institution in accordance herewith. In such event, the Assuming Institution and the Receiver shall make all such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give effect to each correction reflected in such corrected computations, retroactive to the date on which the corresponding incorrect computation was made. It is the intention of this provision to align the timing of the audit required under this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement with the examination audit required pursuant to 12 CFR Section 363.
(b) The Assuming Institution shall perform on an annual basis an internal audit of its compliance with the provisions of this Article II and shall provide the Receiver and the Corporation with copies of the internal audit reports and access to internal audit workpapers related to such internal audit.
(c) The Receiver or the Corporation, their agents, contractors and their employees, may perform an audit to determine the Assuming Institution's compliance with the provisions of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement, including this Article II, at any time by providing not less than ten (10) Business Days prior written notice. The scope and duration of any such audit shall be within the discretion of the Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, but shall in no event be administered in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the operation of the Assuming Institution's business. The Receiver or the Corporation, as the case may be, shall bear the expense of any such audit. In the event that any corrections are necessary as a result of such an audit, the Assuming Institution and the Receiver shall make such accounting adjustments and payments as may be necessary to give retroactive effect to such corrections.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article II, the Receiver, upon the direction of the Director (or designee) of the Corporation's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, may withhold payment for any amounts included in a Quarterly Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.1, if, in its judgment, there is a reasonable basis under the terms of this Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement for denying the eligibility of an item for which reimbursement or payment is sought under such Section. In such event, the Receiver shall provide a written notice to the Assuming Institution detailing the grounds for withholding such payment. At such time as the Assuming Institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Receiver that the grounds for such withholding of payment, or portion of payment, no longer exist or have been cured, then the Receiver shall pay the Assuming Institution the amount withheld which the Receiver determines is eligible for payment, within fifteen (15) Business Days. In the event the Receiver or the Assuming Institution elects to submit the issue of the eligibility of the item for reimbursement or payment for determination under the dispute resolution procedures of Section 2.1(f), then (i) if the dispute is settled by the mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with Section 2.1(f)(iii), the Receiver shall pay the amount withheld (to the extent so agreed) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date upon which the dispute is determined by the parties to be resolved by mutual agreement, and (ii) if the dispute is resolved by the
2.4 .
Withholdings
 
determination of a Review Board, the Receiver shall pay the amount withheld (to the extent so determined) within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date upon which the Receiver is notified of the determination by the Review Board of its obligation to make such payment.

PEOPLE'S UNITED ACQUIRES DEPOSITS AND BANKING OPERATIONS OF BUTLER BANK FROM THE FDIC
Expands Massachusetts Presence in Greater Boston Market
 People's United Bank, a subsidiary of People's United Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq: PBCT), announced today that it has acquired all of the deposits, certain assets and the banking operations of Butler Bank, located in Lowell, MA. People's United will receive approximately $237 million of assets and has assumed approximately $243 million in liabilities, of which $229 million are deposits. As part of this transaction, People's United has entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC covering all acquired loans and foreclosed real estate.
BRIDGEPORT, CT
This transaction expands the New England footprint of People's United Bank to the greater Boston market. It delivers on the bank's strategy to deploy its excess liquidity through opportunistic expansion by high risk-adjusted return acquisitions which leverage its core competencies. Following this transaction, People's United will continue to have significant excess capital and liquidity on a basis.
pro forma
"The acquisition of Butler Bank and its Marlborough Co-Operative division represents an excellent opportunity for People's United Bank to expand into attractive, high-density markets in the greater Boston area, and we are very excited to partner with our new employees to bring our award-winning brand of service to customers in the area," said Philip R. Sherringham, President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank.
"We are very pleased to introduce the financial strength and stability of People's United to the employees, customers and communities of Butler Bank," said Sherringham.
"We understand what customers look for in their banking relationship. They want familiar bankers who provide knowledgeable service and offer a broad range of products and services," he said. "Customers also seek a stable bank with solid asset quality and strong capital, all of which are hallmarks of People's United.
"We are looking forward to working with our new colleagues in the Lowell, Andover and Marlborough areas to serve our customers, build businesses and support communities in the greater Boston market," said Sherringham. "Our new customers can count on seeing the same familiar faces at their branches as our objective is to grow this organization."
Representatives from People's United Bank will be on location at each of the former Butler branches beginning Saturday, April 17, working side-by-side with their new colleagues and customers during the
transition. Over the weekend, the Andover, Marlborough and Post Road Plaza (Marlborough) branches, which normally are open on Saturday, will serve customers as usual. The Lowell headquarters branch will be closed on Saturday, as usual, and will open for its regular hours on Monday.
Depositors can also access their money by writing checks, using ATMs or debit cards, as usual. Checks drawn on Butler Bank will continue to be processed, as normal.
"We welcome our new customers and I wish to assure them that we expect a seamless transition," said Tim Crimmins, Senior Vice President at People's United, who is responsible for the new branches. Crimmins is also President of the two Massachusetts bank divisions of People's United: Flagship Bank of Worcester and The Bank of Western Massachusetts in Springfield.
"Your deposits are safe and will continue to be insured by the FDIC, as they were before the acquisition," Crimmins said. "You can continue to visit any of your local branches, write checks and use all of your existing services as usual.
"Butler Bank customers will begin receiving communications from People's United within the week," Crimmins noted. "We have a 168-year track record of strength and stability. We want our new customers and our new communities to know that we are here for them with a long-term commitment to growing together."
People's United Bank, a diversified financial services company with approximately $22 billion in assets, provides consumer and commercial banking services through a network of nearly 300 branches in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine and New York. Through its subsidiaries, People's United Bank provides equipment financing, asset management, brokerage and financial advisory services, and insurance services.

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 15, 2010
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $14 MILLION OR $0.04 PER SHARE AND INCREASES DIVIDEND
Operating EPS of $0.08per share, excluding merger and system conversion costs
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $13.6 million, or $0.04 per share, for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $24.9 million, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2009, and $24.2 million, or $0.07 per share, for the first quarter of 2009. Included in this quarter's results are $23.4 million of merger-related and system conversion expenses. The net impact of these items reduced first quarter 2010 net income by $15.6 million, or $0.04 per share. Excluding the effect of these items, net income would have been $29.2 million, or $0.08 per share, for the first quarter of 2010. As previously reported, People's United Financial completed its acquisition of Financial Federal Corporation on February 19, 2010. Accordingly, Financial Federal's results of operations are included as of the acquisition date, and prior period results have not been restated to include Financial Federal Corporation.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
The Board of Directors of People's United Financial voted to increase the annual common stock dividend by $0.01 per share, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.62 per share. The quarterly dividend of $0.1550 per share is payable May 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on May 1, 2010. Based on the closing stock price on April 14, 2010, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 3.8 percent.
For the first quarter of 2010, return on average tangible assets was 0.28 percent and return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 1.5 percent, compared to 0.51 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2009. At March 31, 2010, People's United Financial's tangible equity ratio stood at 18.6 percent.
"During the first quarter of 2010, we completed our acquisition of Financial Federal, a leader in equipment financing, providing a valuable complement to our existing equipment financing company, People's Capital and Leasing," stated Philip R. Sherringham, President and Chief Executive Officer. "As anticipated, the transaction was immediately accretive to earnings, though our results will not reflect a full quarter's benefit until the second quarter. We also successfully completed the first phase of our core systems conversion and are now focused on the final phase, which is slated for July."

Sherringham added, "We continue to diligently pursue acquisition opportunities for both FDIC-assisted and open bank transactions. As we have previously stated, we are evaluating our current market as well as non-contiguous, attractive high-growth markets for acquisitions."
Sherringham concluded, "We are pleased to reward our shareholders with an 18
th
consecutive annual dividend increase. The strength of our capital and liquidity, asset quality and earnings, as well as the fact that our balance sheet remains funded almost entirely by deposits and stockholders' equity, continue to set us apart from most in the industry."
"On an operating basis, excluding merger-related and system conversion costs, earnings were $29.2 million, or 8 cents per share this quarter," said Paul D. Burner, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Significant drivers of the company's performance this quarter were an improvement in the net interest margin, modest loan growth across our strategic lending businesses, and lower net loan charge-offs for the second consecutive quarter. The net interest margin improved 28 basis points to 3.47 percent, reflecting the combined benefit of Financial Federal and a 16 basis point reduction in our cost of deposits this quarter."
Commenting on asset quality, Burner stated, "Loans acquired in connection with the Financial Federal acquisition were recorded at fair value, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of that portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio. For the originated loan portfolio, representing all loans other than those acquired in the Financial Federal transaction, non-performing loans totaled $192.3 million at March 31, 2010, and the ratio of non-performing loans to originated loans was 1.36 percent, compared to $168.8 million and 1.19 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Non-performing loans in the acquired loan portfolio, which represent those loans acquired in the Financial Federal transaction that meet our definition of non-performing but for which the risk of loss has already been considered in connection with our estimate of acquisition-date fair value, totaled $51.7 million at March 31, 2010."
Non-performing assets totaled $247.5 million at March 31, 2010, a $41.9 million increase from December 31, 2009, of which $19.8 million is attributable to repossessed assets acquired in connection with the Financial Federal acquisition. Non-performing assets equaled 1.74 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at March 31, 2010 compared to 1.44 percent at December 31, 2009. At March 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of originated loans was 1.22 percent and as a percentage of non-performing originated loans was 90 percent, compared to 1.21 percent and 102 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2009.
First quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $9.5 million compared to $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.26 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 0.38 percent in the prior year's fourth quarter. The level of the allowance for loan losses is unchanged from December 31, 2009.

Selected Financial Terms
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, and tangible book value per share. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and nonrecurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and nonrecurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be nonrecurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares outstanding (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares).
