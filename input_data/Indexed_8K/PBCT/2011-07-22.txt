FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 21, 2011
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $51 MILLION OR $0.15 PER SHARE; OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.17 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $51.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $16.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the second quarter of 2010, and $51.7 million, or $0.15 per share, for the first quarter of 2011. Operating earnings totaled $57.3 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $31.8 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $53.8 million for this year's first quarter. As previously reported, People's United Financial completed its acquisition of Danvers Bancorp, Inc. on June 30, 2011, effective July 1, 2011. Accordingly, People's United Financial's second quarter and six month results do not include the results of Danvers.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
The Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.1575 per share quarterly dividend, payable August 15, 2011 to shareholders of record on August 1, 2011. Based on the closing stock price on July 20, 2011, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 4.7 percent.
"Our performance this quarter continues to build on the momentum generated in the first quarter of 2011, reflecting another solid quarter of operating results, organic loan and deposit growth throughout our franchise, and encouraging overall trends in asset quality," stated Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In fact, on an annualized basis, both loans and deposits increased 4 percent this quarter; our net interest margin remains above 4 percent; and our efficiency ratio continues to improve."
Barnes added, "In the second quarter, our originated commercial and retail loan portfolios increased $239 million, or 9 percent annualized, and $213 million, or 19 percent annualized, respectively. We also had another quarter of meaningful deposit growth in our legacy and de novo branch network. In addition, we successfully completed the Bank of Smithtown core system conversion and our efforts with respect to the Danversbank conversion, scheduled for early in the fourth quarter, are already well under way."

Barnes concluded, "We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our level of non-interest expenses and lower our efficiency ratio. As such, earlier this month we implemented several cost-saving initiatives, which included changes in certain retirement benefit programs and the elimination of selected positions, primarily within corporate functions, non-core lending businesses and the former Bank of Smithtown. We expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $23 million beginning in 2012."
"On an operating basis, earnings were $57 million or 17 cents per share this quarter," said Kirk W. Walters, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The Company's performance this quarter reflects an improvement in net interest income, continued positive results in our fee businesses and tighter expense control."
Walters continued, "The net interest margin increased 44 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 compared to last year's second quarter and, as expected, declined a modest 3 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The decline in the net interest margin from the first quarter reflects repricing pressure within the loan portfolios, partially offset by an increase in investment income and a reduction in our cost of deposits."
Walters added, "Non-interest income this quarter continues to reflect improvement in most of our fee-based businesses as well as additional gains on sales of acquired loans, partially offset by weakness in insurance revenue and lower gains on sales of residential mortgages. The level of quarterly operating non-interest expense continues to remain below $200 million, despite the addition of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2010, and our efficiency ratio improved to 65.7 percent."
Walters concluded, "While the overall level of non-performing loans is reflective of a period of prolonged economic weakness, we are pleased with the improvements noted over the past few quarters. The increase in originated non-performing loans this quarter is attributable to a single commercial real estate loan (with a remaining balance of $23 million) that was placed on non-accrual status this quarter. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses this quarter reflects a $6.0 million charge-off on this loan against a previously established specific reserve, partially offset by steps taken to increase the allowance for loan losses in light of continued strong growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios. In addition, the decline of $74.0 million in acquired non-performing loans this quarter reflects our efforts to proactively reduce this portfolio through a variety of resolution efforts."

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions have been recorded at fair value, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio.
At June 30, 2011, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of originated loans was 1.15 percent and as a percentage of originated non-performing loans was 68 percent, compared to 1.19 percent and 74 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2011.
For the originated portfolio, representing all loans other than those acquired, non-performing loans totaled $258.8 million at June 30, 2011, or 1.69 percent of originated loans, compared to $240.5 million and 1.62 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2011, and $219.7 million and 1.57 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2010. Excluding the $23 million non-performing commercial real estate loan discussed above, originated non-performing loans were 1.54 percent of originated loans at June 30, 2011.
Non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio, which represent the contractual balances of loans acquired that meet our definition of non-performing but for which the risk of loss has already been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition-date fair value and/or the existence of an FDIC loss-share agreement, totaled $250.4 million at June 30, 2011 compared to $324.4 million at March 31, 2011 and $359.8 million at December 31, 2010. During the second quarter, loans with a contractual balance of approximately $56 million (carrying amount of approximately $41 million) were sold at a gain of approximately $7 million. In addition, loans with a contractual balance of approximately $64 million were reduced by virtue of full or partial payoffs.
Non-performing assets (excluding acquired non-performing loans) totaled $315.4 million at June 30, 2011, up from $292.1 million at March 31, 2011 and $284.5 million at June 30, 2010. Non-performing assets equaled 2.05 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at June 30, 2011 compared to 1.96 percent at March 31, 2011 and 2.02 percent at June 30, 2010.
Second quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $15.5 million compared to $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2011. The previously mentioned commercial real estate loan, which carried a specific reserve, accounted for $6.0 million, or 39 percent, of this quarter's total loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.35 percent in the second quarter of 2011 (0.22 percent excluding the aforementioned $6.0 million loan charge-off) compared to 0.22 percent in this year's first quarter. The provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2011 reflects a $4.5 million increase in the allowance for loan losses related to the growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios.
For the second quarter of 2011, the return on average assets was 0.82 percent and the return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 6.3 percent, compared to 0.84 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2011 and 0.29 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, for the second quarter of 2010. Operating return on average assets was 0.92 percent for the second quarter of 2011, compared to 0.87 percent for the first quarter of 2011 and 0.58 percent for the second quarter of 2010. Operating return on average tangible equity was 7.1 percent for the second quarter of 2011, compared to 6.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011 and 3.4 percent for the second quarter of 2010. At June 30, 2011, People's United Financial's tangible equity ratio stood at 13.9 percent.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles and certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets, other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, core system conversion costs, and one-time charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings by average assets on an annualized basis. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings by average tangible stockholders' equity on an annualized basis. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
