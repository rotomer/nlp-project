FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 20, 2011
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.19 PER SHARE AND NET INCOME OF $0.15 PER SHARE; AUTHORIZES ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $52.9 million, or $0.15 per share, for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $24.1 million, or $0.07 per share, for the third quarter of 2010, and $51.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the second quarter of 2011. Operating earnings were $67.3 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $27.7 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $57.3 million for this year's second quarter. Included in this quarter's results are $14.4 million (after-tax) of merger-related expenses and one-time charges, including $6.2 million related to the prepayment of assumed FHLB advances. As previously reported, People's United Financial completed its acquisition of Danvers Bancorp, Inc. on June 30, 2011, effective July 1, 2011. Accordingly, Danvers' results of operations are included as of the effective date, and prior period results have not been restated to include Danvers.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
During the third quarter of 2011 the Company completed the stock repurchase authorization announced in January 2011 by purchasing 15.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $11.81 per share. Today, People's United Financial's Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization. Under the authorization, up to 5 percent of the Company's common stock outstanding, or 18 million shares, can be repurchased, either directly or through agents, in the open market at prices and terms satisfactory to management.
The Company's Board of Directors also declared a $0.1575 per share quarterly dividend, payable November 15, 2011 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2011. Based on the closing stock price on October 19, 2011, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 5.2 percent.
"Our performance this quarter continues to reflect improvements in our operating metrics, including another solid quarter of organic loan and deposit growth throughout our franchise, and encouraging trends in asset quality," stated Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In fact, on an annualized basis and excluding the effect of the Danvers acquisition, loans and deposits increased 15 percent and 6 percent, respectively, from June 30, 2011; our net interest margin remains above 4 percent; and our efficiency ratio improved to 63.1 percent from 71.2 percent in the year-ago quarter."

Barnes added, "We have made significant progress over the past year converting acquired companies onto a single core operating system. In addition, we simplified the operations within our wealth management businesses, specifically our brokerage and insurance subsidiaries, which underwent their own respective system conversions. Just this past weekend we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion, which will improve our operating results in future periods."
Barnes concluded, "We remain focused on delivering shareholder value by leveraging opportunities within our existing markets. Our emphasis on building lasting relationships throughout our franchise and continuing to cross-sell our products across all lines of business are key contributors to our organic growth and strong operating performance. Further, we continue to strengthen our position in the important Boston and New York MSAs."
"On an operating basis, earnings were $67 million, or 19 cents per share, this quarter," said Kirk W. Walters, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The Company's performance this quarter reflects an improvement in net interest income, continued positive results in our fee businesses and tighter expense control."
Walters continued, "The net interest margin increased 37 basis points in the third quarter of 2011 compared to last year's third quarter and remained relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2011, declining a modest two basis points. Non-interest income this quarter continues to reflect improvement in most of our fee-based businesses, as well as the addition of Danvers. The entire increase in the level of operating non-interest expense this quarter reflects the Danvers acquisition, partially offset by benefits from cost-savings initiatives announced last quarter."
Walters concluded, "While the overall level of non-performing loans is reflective of a period of prolonged economic weakness, we are pleased with the credit trends noted over the past few quarters. In fact, our year-to-date net loan charge-off ratio of 28 basis points is roughly one-quarter of our peers', which is a reflection of the Company's historically strong underwriting standards, the strength of the footprint in which we operate and the vigor of our customers who have successfully managed through the economic crises."
At September 30, 2011, People's United Financial's tier 1 common and total risk-based capital ratios were 15.0 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively, and the tangible equity ratio stood at 12.5 percent. People's United Bank's tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 14.1 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2011.

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions have been recorded at fair value, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio.
At September 30, 2011, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of originated loans, which represents all loans other than those acquired, was 1.09 percent and as a percentage of originated non-performing loans was 69 percent, compared to 1.15 percent and 68 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2011. For the originated commercial banking portfolio, the allowance for loan losses ratio was 1.48 percent at September 30, 2011 and represented 92 percent of non-performing commercial banking loans at that date.
For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 1.60 percent of originated loans at September 30, 2011, compared to 1.69 percent at June 30, 2011 and 1.77 percent at September 30, 2010. Non-performing assets (excluding acquired non-performing loans) equaled 1.88 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at September 30, 2011 compared to 2.05 percent at June 30, 2011 and 2.19 percent at September 30, 2010.
Non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio, which represent the contractual balances of loans acquired that meet our definition of non-performing but for which the risk of loss has already been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition-date fair value and/or the existence of an FDIC loss-share agreement, totaled $241.6 million at September 30, 2011 compared to $250.4 million at June 30, 2011 and $359.8 million at December 31, 2010. During the third quarter, loans with a contractual balance of approximately $41 million (carrying amount of approximately $32 million) were sold at a net loss of approximately $5 million.
Third quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $13.4 million compared to $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2011. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.27 percent in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 0.35 percent in this year's second quarter. The provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2011 reflects a $5.7 million increase in the allowance for loan losses related to the growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios, partially offset by charge-offs of $4.7 million against previously established specific reserves.
Operating return on average assets was 0.98 percent for the third quarter of 2011, compared to 0.92 percent for the second quarter of 2011 and 0.50 percent for the third quarter of 2010. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 8.0 percent for the third quarter of 2011, compared to 7.1 percent for the second quarter of 2011 and 3.1 percent for the third quarter of 2010.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP
 
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles and certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, core system conversion costs and one-time charges related to executive-level management separation and severance-related costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.

Acquired Loan Portfolio
Actual Credit Experience vs. Expectations
Acquired loans initially recorded at fair value (inclusive of related credit mark) without carryover of historical ALLL
Accounting model is cash-flow based:
Contractual cash flows (principal & interest) less Expected cash flows (principal & interest) = non-accretable difference (utilized to absorb actual portfolio losses)
> Expected cash flows (principal & interest) less fair value = accretable yield
Cash flows are both acquisition and pool specific
> Expected cash flows are regularly reassessed and compared to actual cash collections
Better than expected credit experience results in reclass of non-accretable difference to accretable yield (prospective yield adjustment over the life of the loans)

(a) Represent contractual amounts; loans meet People's United Financial's definition of a non-performing loan but are not subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, these loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level and not to contractual interest payments i at the loan level.
(b) Smithtown charge-offs include $14.5MM, $8.2M and $17.7M incurred upon sale of acquired loans in 3Q11, 2Q11, and 1Q11, 6 respectively.

Current Asset Sensitivity
We do not expect short-term interest rates to rise any time soon
Given short-term interest rates are very low and are expected to remain low for the near term, we continue to hold securities
For 2Q 2011 we were 2.8x3.5x as asset sensitive as the estimated median of our new peer group, depending on the scenario
For an immediate parallel increase of 100bps, our net interest income is projected to increase by ~$50MM on an annualized basis
Yield curve twist scenarios confirm that we are reasonably well protected from bull flattener (short rates are unchanged, long rates fall) and benefit considerably from bear flattener environments (short rates rise, long rates are unchanged)
