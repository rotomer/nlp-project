PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.17 PER SHARE AND NET INCOME OF $0.12 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today announced net income of $43.0 million, or $0.12 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $32.0 million, or $0.09 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2010, and $52.9 million, or $0.15 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. Operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $36.7 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $67.3 million, or $0.19 per share, for this year's third quarter. Included in the quarterly results are merger-related expenses and one-time charges (after-tax) totaling $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $14.4 million in the third quarter of 2011.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income totaled $198.8 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to $85.7 million, or $0.24 per share, for 2010. Operating earnings were $237.1 million, or $0.68 per share, for 2011, compared to $125.4 million, or $0.35 per share, for 2010. Included in both the 2011 and 2010 results are $38.3 million and $39.7 million (after-tax), respectively, of merger-related expenses, core system conversion costs and one-time charges.
The Board of Directors of People's United Financial declared a $0.1575 per share quarterly dividend, payable February 15, 2012 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2012. Based on the closing stock price on January 18, 2012, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 4.7 percent.
"Our performance throughout 2011 reflects the significant progress we have made in carrying out our two primary objectives - optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital," stated Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our focus on organic loan and deposit growth throughout the franchise, including new market opportunities within the Boston and New York City MSAs, has resulted in improved operating leverage, which is evident in our 2011 financial results."

Barnes added, "Integration of acquisitions has become a core competency for this organization. We have now integrated five acquisitions since early 2010 and exceeded our estimated cost benefits announced at the time of each transaction. Our momentum is based on a 170-year track record with continued outstanding customer service throughout the financial crisis. Offering the full breadth of products and services that our customers need, providing relationship-based solutions, and effectively cross-selling our products across all lines of business are key contributors to our continued growth and strong operating performance."
Barnes concluded, "We remain focused on delivering shareholder value by leveraging opportunities within our existing markets. Further, we have demonstrated our ability to prudently and effectively deploy capital through organic loan and deposit growth, adherence to a strong dividend policy, share repurchases and a thoughtful acquisition strategy."
"On an operating basis, earnings were $59 million, or 17 cents per share, this quarter," said Kirk W. Walters, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The Company's performance this quarter reflects an improvement in net interest income, higher provision expense, an expected decline in fee income, and tighter expense control."
Walters continued, "The net interest margin increased 29 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to last year's fourth quarter and 5 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2011. The operating net interest margin was 4.07 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 4.11 percent in the third quarter. Included in this quarter's net interest margin is $5 million of cost recovery income from the acquired loan portfolio, which added nine basis points to the margin. As expected, non-interest income declined $13 million from the prior quarter, which was driven by a decrease in bank service charges of approximately $5 million due to changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act and lower net security gains of $8.6 million. The decrease in the level of operating non-interest expense this quarter reflects the continued benefit from cost-savings initiatives announced earlier in 2011."
Walters concluded, "While the overall level of non-performing loans is reflective of a period of prolonged economic weakness, we are pleased with the credit trends noted over the past few quarters. In fact, throughout 2011, our net loan charge-off ratio represented less than one-third that of our peers', which is a reflection of the Company's historically strong underwriting standards, the strength of the footprint in which we operate and the resilience of our customers who have successfully managed through the economic crisis."
At December 31, 2011, People's United Financial's tier 1 common and total risk-based capital ratios were 14.3 percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, and the tangible equity ratio stood at 12.0 percent. People's United Bank's tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 13.1 percent and 14.0 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2011.
Operating return on average assets was 0.86 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 0.98 percent for the third quarter of 2011 and 0.64 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 7.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 8.0 percent for the third quarter of 2011 and 4.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions have been recorded at fair value based on an initial estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio.
At December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan losses for originated loans as a percentage of originated loans, which represents all loans other than those acquired, was 1.04 percent and as a percentage of originated non-performing loans was 60 percent, compared to 1.09 percent and 69 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2011. For the originated commercial banking portfolio, the allowance for loan losses ratio was 1.39 percent at December 31, 2011 and represented 77 percent of non-performing commercial banking loans at that date.
For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 1.75 percent of originated loans at December 31, 2011, compared to 1.60 percent at September 30, 2011 and 1.70 percent at December 31, 2010. Non-performing assets (excluding acquired non-performing loans) equaled 2.00 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at December 31, 2011 compared to 1.88 percent at September 30, 2011 and 2.09 percent at December 31, 2010.
Non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio, which represent the contractual balances of loans acquired that meet our definition of non-performing but for which the risk of loss has already been considered by virtue of our estimate of acquisition-date fair value and/or the existence of an FDIC loss-share agreement, totaled $249.0 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $241.6 million at September 30, 2011 and $359.8 million at December 31, 2010.
Fourth quarter net loan charge-offs totaled $14.8 million compared to $13.4 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.29 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 0.27 percent in this year's third quarter. The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflects a $7.4 million increase in the allowance for loan losses on originated loans related to the growth in the commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios and a $7.4 million increase due to impairment on acquired loans, partially offset by charge-offs of $8.9 million against previously established specific reserves.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP
 
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles and certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis (excluding certain purchase accounting-related fair value adjustments) plus total non-interest income (including the fully taxable equivalent adjustment on bank-owned life insurance income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, core system conversion costs, charges related to executive-level management separation costs, severance-related costs, and real estate asset writedowns, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
Operating net interest margin excludes from the net interest margin those items that management considers to be of such an infrequent nature that, by excluding such items, People's United Financial's net interest margin can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating net interest margin include, but are not limited to, cost recovery income on acquired loans and changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments. Operating net interest margin is calculated by dividing operating net interest income (annualized) by average earning assets.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated ESOP common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.

Acquired Loan Portfolio
Actual Credit Experience vs. Expectations
Acquired loans initially recorded at fair value (inclusive of related credit mark) without carryover of historical ALLL Accounting model is cash-flow based:
Contractual cash flows (principal & interest) less Expected cash flows (principal & interest) = non-accretable difference (effectively utilized to absorb actual portfolio losses)
Expected cash flows (principal & interest) less fair value = accretable yield
Cash flows are both acquisition and pool specific
Expected cash flows are regularly reassessed and compared to actual cash collections Better than expected credit experience generally results in reclass of non-accretable difference to accretable yield (prospective yield adjustment over the life of the loans)
Worse than expected credit experience results in impairment (increase in allowance for loan losses via charge for loan loss provisions)

(a) Represent contractual amounts; loans meet People's United Financial's definition of a non-performing loan but are not subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, these loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level and not to contractual interest payments at the loan level.
(b) Smithtown carrying amount and related components reflect loan sale, settlement and payoff activity which occurred throughout 2011. (c) Smithtown charge-offs include approximately $41M incurred upon sale of acquired loans throughout 2011.

Acquired Smithtown Portfolio
4Q 2011 Reassessment
At the time of acquisition the loan portfolio was set up, for accounting purposes, as 6 pools and 147 individual loans
The individual loans had an acquisition date carrying amount of $131 million
All 6 pools are generally performing within our initial range of expectations
During the reassessment we recognized $5 million of cost recovery income associated with certain loans which resulted in an increase in net interest income
In addition, we recognized $7.4 million of impairment associated with certain loans which resulted in an increase in the provision for loan losses
At December 31, 2011, the population of loans accounted for individually totaled approximately 70 and represented a carrying amount of less than $40 million
The full year 2011 activity within the acquired Bank of Smithtown portfolio (excluding normal interest accretion) was a $5.1 million benefit consisting of:
$5 million of cost recovery income $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans $7.4 million of impairment

Current Asset Sensitivity
We do not expect short-term interest rates to rise any time soon
Given short-term interest rates are very low and are expected to remain low for the near term, we continue to purchase and hold securities For 3Q 2011 we were 2.2x  2.9x as asset sensitive as the estimated median of our peer group, depending on the scenario For an immediate parallel increase of 100bps, our net interest income is projected to increase by ~$48MM on an annualized basis Yield curve twist scenarios confirm that we are reasonably well protected from bull flattener (short rates are unchanged, long rates fall) and benefit considerably from bear flattener environments (short rates rise, long rates are unchanged)
