Notes: The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator).
People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.

Acquired Loan Portfolio
Actual Credit Experience vs. Expectations
 -  Acquired loans initially recorded at fair value (inclusive of related credit mark) without carryover of historical ALLL
 -  Accounting model is cash-flow based:
 -  Contractual cash flows (principal & interest) less Expected cash flows (principal & interest) = non-accretable difference (effectively utilized to absorb actual portfolio losses)
 -  Expected cash flows (principal & interest) less fair value = accretable yield
 -  Expected cash flows are regularly reassessed and compared to actual cash collections
 -  Reassessments, reflecting better than anticipated credit performance, during the first quarter of 2012 were:
 -  FinFed: reclassified $11.7MM from nonaccretable to accretable based on better than anticipated credit performance
 -  RiverBank: reclassified $1.8MM from nonaccretable to accretable based on better than anticipated credit performance

(a) Initial carrying amounts of acquired portfolios are as follows: FinFed, $1.2BN; Butler, $141MM; RiverBank, $518MM; Smithtown, $1.6BN; and Danvers, $1.9BN.
(b) Represent contractual amounts; loans meet People's United Financial's definition of a non-performing loan but are not subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, these loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level and not to contractual interest payments at the loan level.
(c) Smithtown carrying amount and related components reflect loan sale, settlement and payoff activity which have occurred since acquisition.

Current Asset Sensitivity
 -  We do not expect short-term interest rates to rise any time soon
 -  For 4Q 2011 we were about twice as asset sensitive as the estimated median of our peer group, depending on the scenario
 -  For an immediate parallel increase of 100bps, our net interest income is projected to increase by ~$50MM on an annualized basis
 -  Yield curve twist scenarios confirm that we are reasonably well protected from bull flattener (short rates are unchanged, long rates fall) and benefit considerably from bear flattener environments (short rates rise, long rates are unchanged)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, charges related to executive-level management separation costs, severance-related costs and writedowns of banking house assets, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
Operating net interest margin excludes from the net interest margin those items that management considers to be of such an infrequent nature that, by excluding such items, People's United Financial's net interest margin can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating net interest margin include, but are not limited to, cost recovery income on acquired loans and changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments.
Operating net interest margin is calculated by dividing operating net interest income (annualized) by average earning assets.
48 People's United Financial, Inc.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
