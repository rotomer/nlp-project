PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.20 PER SHARE; NET INCOME OF $0.19 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $64.8 million, or $0.19 per share, for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $51.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the second quarter of 2011, and $58.6 million, or $0.17 per share, for the first quarter of 2012. Operating earnings were $67.2 million, or $0.20 per share, for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $57.3 million, or $0.17 per share, for the second quarter of 2011 and $60.6 million, or $0.18 per share, for the first quarter of 2012.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
The Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend, payable August 15, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 1, 2012. Based on the closing stock price on July 18, 2012, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 5.3 percent.
During the second quarter of 2012 the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares of People's United Financial common stock at a total cost of $54 million and during the first six months of 2012, the Company repurchased 9.0 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $110 million. Under the existing stock repurchase authorization, 9.0 million shares of common stock remain available for repurchase.
"Our performance this quarter continues to build on the execution of our primary objectives  optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital," stated Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our acquisition of 57 branches in the greater New York metro area strengthens our presence in the nation's largest market. Our second quarter financial results reflect continued organic loan and deposit growth and ongoing strength in our fee income businesses, including solid contributions from wealth management. We anticipate continued momentum in loan growth based on our retail and commercial lending pipelines and remain encouraged by the significant opportunity for loan and deposit growth throughout the franchise.

"Our New York metro footprint of nearly 100 branches further enhances our ability to offer our customers a full range of products and superior service," added Barnes. "We are confident in our ability to build on the success of our Stop & Shop franchise in Connecticut as the Bank is now the exclusive provider of banking services at 140 Stop & Shop stores located across Long Island, southern New York state and Connecticut."
Barnes concluded, "Our strong business fundamentals, ongoing ability to leverage our brand in attractive markets, and prospects for organic growth continue to be the foundations of our strength relative to others in the industry. We have demonstrated our ability to prudently and effectively deploy capital through organic loan and deposit growth, adherence to a consistent dividend policy, share repurchases and a thoughtful acquisition strategy."
"On an operating basis, earnings were $67 million, or 20 cents per share, this quarter," stated Kirk W. Walters, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The Company's performance in the second quarter reflects an expected decline in the net interest margin, lower provision expense, improvement in fee-based income and ongoing expense control."
Walters continued, "The decline in the net interest margin this quarter on both a GAAP and operating basis reflects the overall reduction in interest rates and slower loan growth. Non-interest income continues to reflect improvements in most of our fee-based businesses as well as higher loan prepayment fees, partially offset by the seasonal decrease in insurance revenue and lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. The decrease in the level of operating non-interest expense this quarter reflects the continued benefit from cost-savings initiatives announced in 2011."
Walters concluded, "We certainly are pleased with the continued improvement in asset quality. Our low loan charge-off ratio, which represents approximately one-half of our peers, is a reflection of the Company's historically strong underwriting standards, the strength of the footprint in which we operate and the resilience of our customers."
For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 1.52 percent of loans at June 30, 2012, compared to 1.67 percent at March 31, 2012 and 1.69 percent at June 30, 2011. Non-performing assets (excluding acquired non-performing loans) equaled 1.67 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at June 30, 2012 compared to 1.85 percent at March 31, 2012 and 2.05 percent at June 30, 2011. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.26 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 0.22 percent in this year's first quarter.
Non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio, which represent the contractual balances of loans acquired that meet our definition of non-performing but are not, under the accounting model for acquired loans, subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans, totaled $236.6 million at June 30, 2012 compared to $247.2 million at March 31, 2012 and $250.4 million at June 30, 2011.

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions have been recorded at fair value based on an initial estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, charges related to executive-level management separation costs, severance-related costs and writedowns of banking house assets, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
Operating net interest margin excludes from the net interest margin those items that management considers to be of such a discrete nature that, by excluding such items, People's United Financial's net interest margin can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating net interest margin include cost recovery income on acquired loans and changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments. Operating net interest margin is calculated by dividing operating net interest income (annualized) by average earning assets.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
