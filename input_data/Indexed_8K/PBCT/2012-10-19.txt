FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 18, 2012
PEOPLE'S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.19 PER SHARE; NET INCOME OF $0.18 PER SHARE
 People's United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $62.2 million, or $0.18 per share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $51.5 million, or $0.14 per share, for the third quarter of 2011, and $64.6 million, or $0.19 per share, for the second quarter of 2012. Operating earnings were $64.4 million, or $0.19 per share, for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $65.9 million, or $0.18 per share, for the third quarter of 2011 and $67.0 million, or $0.20 per share, for the second quarter of 2012.
BRIDGEPORT, CT.
The Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend, payable November 15, 2012 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2012. Based on the closing stock price on October 17, 2012, the dividend yield on People's United Financial common stock is 5.3 percent.
During the third quarter of 2012 the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares of People's United Financial common stock at a total cost of $54 million and, during the first nine months of 2012, the Company repurchased 13.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $164 million. Under the existing stock repurchase authorization, 4.5 million shares of common stock remain available for repurchase.
"Our performance in the third quarter of 2012 continues to build on the execution of our primary objectives  optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital," stated Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our third quarter financial results reflect another quarter of solid operating metrics in a challenging economic environment, supported by significant loan growth, ongoing strength in our fee income businesses and meaningful cost control, all of which contributed to an improvement in our efficiency ratio.

"We anticipate continued momentum in loan growth based on our retail and commercial lending pipelines and remain encouraged by the significant opportunity for growth throughout the franchise, particularly within the Boston and New York City MSAs," added Barnes. "In addition, strategic revenue initiatives in commercial and retail banking, wealth management and insurance are positively impacting our operating results. Moreover, we are pleased with the continued progress in managing the overall level of operating expenses despite absorbing a full quarter of costs related to the 57 branches we acquired late in the second quarter."
Barnes concluded, "Our strong business fundamentals, ongoing ability to leverage our brand in attractive markets, dedicated and customer-focused employees, and prospects for growth continue to be the foundations of our strength relative to others in the industry. We have demonstrated our ability to prudently and effectively deploy capital through organic loan and deposit growth, a consistent dividend policy, continued share repurchases and a thoughtful acquisition strategy."
"On an operating basis, earnings were $64 million, or 19 cents per share, this quarter," stated Kirk W. Walters, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "The Company's performance in the third quarter reflects our continued focus on improving operating leverage by increasing fee-based income and ongoing expense control."
Walters continued, "The decline in the net interest margin this quarter on both a GAAP and operating basis reflects continued repricing pressure within the loan portfolios partially offset by a reduction in our cost of deposits. Non-interest income reflects ongoing improvement in most of our fee-based businesses, the seasonal increase in insurance revenue and higher loan prepayment fees. The efficiency ratio improved to 61.4 percent this quarter, as revenue growth and the progress we are making as a result of cost savings initiatives offset the increase in the level of operating non-interest expense this quarter attributable to our recent purchase of 57 branches."
Walters concluded, "We certainly are pleased with the continued improvement in asset quality. Our loan charge-off ratio of 18 basis points this quarter, which represents less than one-half of our peers', is the Company's lowest in over three years. This is a reflection of the Company's historically strong underwriting standards, the economic strength of the geography in which we operate and the resilience of our customers. Of note, non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio have declined $158 million, or 44 percent, since December 31, 2010."
For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 1.45 percent of loans at September 30, 2012, compared to 1.52 percent at June 30, 2012 and 1.60 percent at September 30, 2011. Non-performing assets (excluding acquired non-performing loans) equaled 1.59 percent of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets at September 30, 2012, compared to 1.67 percent at June 30, 2012 and 1.88 percent at September 30, 2011. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans on an annualized basis were 0.18 percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 0.26 percent in this year's second quarter.

Non-performing loans in the acquired portfolio, which represent the contractual balances of loans acquired that meet our definition of non-performing but are not, under the accounting model for acquired loans, subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans, totaled $202.0 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $236.6 million at June 30, 2012 and $241.6 million at September 30, 2011.
Operating return on average assets was 0.91 percent for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 0.96 percent for the third quarter of 2011 and 0.97 percent for the second quarter of 2012. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity was 8.6 percent for the third quarter of 2012, compared to 7.8 percent for the third quarter of 2011 and 8.9 percent for the second quarter of 2012.
At September 30, 2012, People's United Financial's tier 1 common and total risk-based capital ratios were 13.6 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively, and the tangible equity ratio stood at 11.2 percent. People's United Bank's tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 13.2 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2012.
Previously reported results for (i) the first two quarters of 2012, (ii) all four quarters of 2011, and (iii) the fourth quarter of 2010 have been revised to reflect a reduction in interest income on certain acquired loans relating to an unintentional overstatement of interest income. The effect of these revisions was immaterial to each period (no change in basic and diluted earnings per share for the first and second quarters of 2012 and the first and fourth quarters of 2011, and a one cent reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share for the second and third quarters of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010). Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was reduced by $0.2 million, $1.3 million, $1.6 million, $1.4 million, $1.7 million, $1.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively, reflecting the after-tax decreases in total interest on loans and net interest income in each period.
People's United Financial, a diversified financial services company with $29 billion in assets, provides commercial and retail banking, as well as wealth management services through a network of 417 branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Through its subsidiaries, People's United Financial provides equipment financing, brokerage and insurance services. Assets under administration and those under full discretionary management, neither of which are reported as assets of People's United Financial, totaled $12.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2012.

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions have been recorded at fair value based on an initial estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio's historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the originated' portfolio and the acquired' portfolio.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP
In addition to evaluating People's United Financial's results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People's United Financial's underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks and thrifts. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People's United Financial's capital position.
The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangibles, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE") basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.
Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United Financial's results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to, merger-related expenses, charges related to executive-level management separation costs, severance-related costs and writedowns of banking house assets, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing operating earnings by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding for the respective period. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders' equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders' equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.
Operating net interest margin excludes from the net interest margin those items that management considers to be of such a discrete nature that, by excluding such items, People's United Financial's net interest margin can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating net interest margin include cost recovery income on acquired loans and changes in the accretable yield on acquired loans stemming from periodic cash flow reassessments. Operating net interest margin is calculated by dividing operating net interest income (annualized) by average earning assets.
The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders' equity (total stockholders' equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders' equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") common shares).
In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People's United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.

Acquired Loan Portfolio
Acquired loans initially recorded at fair value (inclusive of related credit mark) without carryover of historical ALLL
Accounting model is cash-flow based:
Contractual cash flows (principal & interest) less Expected cash flows (principal & interest) = non-accretable difference (effectively utilized to absorb actual portfolio losses) Expected cash flows (principal & interest) less fair value = accretable yield Expected cash flows are regularly reassessed and compared to actual cash collections

Initial carrying amounts of acquired portfolios are as follows: FinFed, $1.2BN; Butler, $141MM; RiverBank, $518MM; Smithtown, $1.6BN; and Danvers, $1.9BN.
Carrying amount and related components reflect loan sale, settlement and payoff activity which have occurred since acquisition.
Represent contractual amounts; loans meet People's United Financial's definition of a non-performing loan but are not subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Rather, these loans are considered to be accruing loans because their interest income relates to the accretable yield recognized at the pool level and not to contractual interest payments at the loan level.

Current Asset Sensitivity
For 2Q 2012 we were more than twice as asset sensitive as the estimated median of our peer group
For an immediate parallel increase of 100bps, our net interest income is projected to increase by ~$60MM on an annualized basis
Yield curve twist scenarios confirm that we are reasonably well protected from bull flattener (short rates are unchanged, long rates fall) and benefit considerably from bear flattener environments (short rates rise, long rates are unchanged)
