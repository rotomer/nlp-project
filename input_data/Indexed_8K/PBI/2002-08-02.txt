As a wholly owned subsidiary of Pitney Bowes, PSI will operate under its current management and continue to focus on providing presort mail services. "We are pleased to complete the acquisition of PSI Group," said Michael J. Critelli, Chairman and CEO of Pitney Bowes. "Their knowledge and expertise in helping high-volume mailers reduce the costs and speed the delivery of mail complements our existing services and will help us better serve our customers.
