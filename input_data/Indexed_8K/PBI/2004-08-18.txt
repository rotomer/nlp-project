(e)
                                 
implication of a possible downgrading of such rating), as soon as the Issuer learns of such downgrading, proposal to downgrade or public announcement.
 
As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months after the date of each acceptance by the Issuer of an offer to purchase Securities hereunder, the Issuer will make generally available to its securityholders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the later of (i) the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such acceptance and (iii) the date of the Issuer's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such acceptance, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.

If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and any Distributor on the other from the offering pursuant to this Agreement of the Securities which are the subject of the action or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuer on the one hand and any Distributor on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and any Distributor on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering pursuant to this Agreement of the Securities which are the subject of the action (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuer bear to the total discounts and commissions received by such Distributor from the offering of such Securities pursuant to this Agreement.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer or such Distributor and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Distributor shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities which are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through it pursuant to this Agreement or upon resale of Securities purchased by it from the Issuer exceeds the amount of any damages which such Distributor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of each Distributor in this subsection (d) to contribute are several, in the same proportion which the amount of the Securities which are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through such Distributor pursuant to this Agreement bears to the total amount of such Securities distributed to the public through all of the Distributors pursuant to this Agreement, and not joint.
(d)
                                
 
The obligations of the Issuer under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
(e)
                                 
conditions, to each person, if any, who controls each Distributor within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Distributor under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which each Distributor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Issuer, to each officer of the Issuer who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of the Act.
 
.  In soliciting offers to purchase the Securities from the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and in assuming its other obligations hereunder (other than any obligation to purchase Securities pursuant to Section 3 hereof), each Distributor is acting individually and not jointly and is acting solely as agent for the Issuer and not as principal.  In connection with the placement of any Securities by a Distributor, acting as agent, (a) each Distributor will make reasonable best efforts to assist the Issuer in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from the Issuer has been solicited by such Distributor and accepted by the Issuer, but such Distributor shall have no liability to the Issuer in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason; and (b) if the Issuer shall default on its obligations to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Issuer (i) shall hold the Distributors harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Issuer, and (ii) shall pay to the Distributors any commission to which they would be entitled in connection with such sale.
8
                                         
Status of Each Distributor
 
.  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuer or its officers and of the Distributors set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Distributor, the Issuer or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason or if for any reason the sale of Securities described in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 by the Issuer to a Distributor is not consummated, the Issuer shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4(i) and the obligations of the Issuer under Section 4(f) and the respective obligations of the Issuer and the Distributors pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect.  In addition, if any such termination of this Agreement shall occur either (i) at a time when any Distributor shall own any of the Securities with the intention of reselling them or (ii) after the Issuer has accepted an offer to purchase Securities and prior to the related settlement, the obligations of the Issuer under the second sentence of Section 4(c), under Sections  4(a), 4(b), 4(d), 4(e), 4(g), 4(h) and 4(j) and, in the case of a termination occurring as described in (ii) above, under Sections 3(b)(vii), 6(a) and 6(e) and under the last sentence of Section 8, shall also remain in effect.

Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
 
.  This Agreement may be terminated for any reason at any time by the Issuer as to any Distributor or, in the case of any Distributor, by such Distributor insofar as this Agreement relates to such Distributor, upon the giving of one day's written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto; , , that, subject to the provisions of Section 5, this Agreement may not be terminated with respect to a Distributor by the giving of such notice following the execution by the Issuer and such Distributor of a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 relating to the purchase of Securities  by or through such Distributor and prior to delivery of the Securities described in such Terms Agreement. Any settlement with respect to Securities placed by a Distributor on an agency basis occurring after termination of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the Procedures and each Distributor agrees, if requested by the Issuer, to take the steps therein provided to be taken by such Distributor in connection with such settlement.

The Distributors are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Securities with respect to which an index is used to determine the amounts of payments of principal and any premium and interest, and the Issuer shall agree to any sales of such Securities (whether offered on any agency or principal basis), only in  a minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000.  The Issuer will not issue Securities denominated in Yen otherwise than in compliance with applicable Japanese laws, regulations and policies.  In particular, the Issuer or its designated agent shall submit such reports or information as may be required from time to time by applicable law, regulations and guidelines promulgated by Japanese governmental and regulatory authorities in the case of the issue and purchase of the Securities and the Issuer shall ensure that each such Security shall have a minimum denomination of 1,000,000 and a minimum maturity of one year or such other minimum denomination and maturity as may be allowed from time to time by Japanese governmental and regulatory authorities.
