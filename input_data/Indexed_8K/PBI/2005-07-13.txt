     The Issuer may redeem the Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, accrued but unpaid interest on those Notes to the redemption date, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any, as defined below.
     means, in connection with any optional redemption, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the date of such redemption of each dollar of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption, that would have been payable in respect of each such dollar if such redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate, determined on the third business day preceding the date notice of such redemption is given, from the respective dates on which such principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption had not been made, to the date of redemption, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed.

     Pitney Bowes Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal amount specified on the Schedule of Increases or Decreases hereto (any currency specified above other than U.S. dollars being hereinafter referred to as a "Specified Currency") on the Stated Maturity specified above and to pay interest thereon (computed, unless a different Computation Period is specified above, on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), from and including the Issue Date specified above (the "Issue Date") or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on this Security (or any predecessor Security) has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date, on the Interest Payment Date(s) specified above in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date") and at Maturity, at the rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment; provided, however, that, unless the Holder hereof is entitled to make, and has made, a Specified Currency Payment Election (as hereinafter defined) with respect to one or more such payments, the Company will make all such payments in respect of this Security in U.S. dollars in amounts determined as set forth on the reverse hereof. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a Market Day (as defined on the reverse hereof)) next preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless a different Regular Record Date is specified above (the "Regular Record Date"); provided, however, that interest payable at Maturity will be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable; and provided, further, that, if the Issue Date is after a Regular Record Date and before the next succeeding Interest Payment Date the first payment of interest shall be payable on the second Interest Payment Date following the Issue Date to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     Any interest on this Security that is payable but not punctually paid or duly provided for ("") on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of such Holder having been a Holder on such Regular Record Date. Such defaulted interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or clause (b) below:
defaulted interest
     (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any defaulted interest to the persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee funds equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment. Such funds when deposited shall be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such defaulted interest as provided in this clause (a). Thereupon the Trustee promptly shall fix a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest in respect of the Securities, which shall be
 
not more than 15 nor less than ten days prior to the date of the proposed payment. The Trustee promptly shall notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date thereof to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities at his address as it appears in the Security register, not less than ten days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such defaulted interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such defaulted interest in respect of the Securities shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective predecessor Securities) are registered on such special record date and such defaulted interest shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
     (b) The Company may make payment of any defaulted interest on the Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity specified on the face hereof falls on a day that is not a Market Day with respect to this Security, the related payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest will be made on the next succeeding Market Day as if made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.
     If (a) this Security is payable in U.S. dollars or (b) this Security is payable in a Specified Currency and (i) the Holder is not entitled to make, or has not made, a Specified Currency Payment Election and the Exchange Rate Agent is able to convert the Specified Currency into U.S. dollars or (ii) the Specified Currency is unavailable to the Company because of the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, then payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the designated office of the Trustee at Citibank, N.A., 111 Wall Street, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10005 (the ""), or such other office or agency of the Company maintained by it for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public or public debts; provided, however, that payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest due on this Security at Maturity will be made in immediately available funds at such Designated Office or other office or agency if this Security is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payments in accordance with its normal procedures; and provided, further, that, unless this Security is a Global Security, at the option of the Company payment of interest due on this Security on an Interest Payment Date other than Maturity may be made by check mailed to the address of the Holder as such address shall appear in the Security Register; or by wire transfer to an account maintained by such Holder with a bank located in the United States, provided that such Holder shall have provided in writing to the Trustee, on or prior to the relevant Regular Record Date, appropriate payment instructions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Security is a Global Security, all payments due on this Security will be made in immediately available funds to the Holder.
Designated Office
 
     If this Security is payable in a Specified Currency and (i) the Holder hereof is entitled to make, and has made, a Specified Currency Payment Election with respect to such payments and (ii) either the Specified Currency is available to the Company or is not available to the Company for any reason other than the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, then (x) the payment of interest due on this Security on any Interest Payment Date other than Maturity will be made in the Specified Currency (or, if such Specified Currency is not at the time of such payment legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, in such other coin or currency of the country which issued such Specified Currency as at the time of such payment is legal tender for the payment of such debts) by check drawn upon a bank office located outside the United States and mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, and (y) payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest due at Maturity will be made in such Specified Currency (or, if applicable, such other coin or currency) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the Holder hereof with a bank office located in the country which issued the Specified Currency upon presentation of this Security to the Trustee in time for such wire transfer to be made by the Trustee in accordance with its normal procedures. If this Security is payable in a Specified Currency, the Holder hereof may elect, if specified above, to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security in such Specified Currency (a "") by delivery of a written request (including, in the case of an election with respect to payments at Maturity, appropriate wire transfer instructions) to the Trustee at its Designated Office referred to above on or prior to the relevant Regular Record Date or the fifteenth day prior to Maturity, as the case may be. Such request may be in writing (mailed or hand delivered) or by facsimile transmission. In such circumstance, the Holder may elect to receive payment in the Specified Currency for all payments of principal (and premium, if any) and interest and need not file a separate election for each payment. Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee, but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or prior to the relevant Regular Record Date or the fifteenth day prior to Maturity, as the case may be. If this Security is a Global Security, the Holder shall be entitled to make a Specified Currency Payment Election with respect to all or any part of the principal amount of this Security and in such circumstances, as well as the circumstances referred to in clause (ii) above, all payments due on this Security will be made in immediately available funds in the Specified Currency to the Holder. Reference herein to the Specified Currency shall be deemed to include such other coin or currency as at the time of any payment with respect to this Security is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts in the country issuing the Specified Currency at the time this Security was originally issued.
Specified Currency Payment Election
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed by manual or facsimile signature under its corporate seal.
