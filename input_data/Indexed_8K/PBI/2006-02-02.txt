Exhibit 99.1 ------------ PITNEY BOWES ANNOUNCES 4TH QUARTER RESULTS ------------------------------------------ STAMFORD, Conn., February 1, 2006 - Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2005 financial results. Michael J. Critelli noted, "I am very pleased with our performance during the quarter which featured strong growth in revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings per share. I am also pleased with the progress we made throughout 2005 as successful execution of our growth strategies resulted in more solutions, for more customers, in more places worldwide. We are excited about the opportunities that lie before us in 2006 to participate in even more segments of the growing global mailstream and deliver even more value for our customers and shareholders." 2005 RESULTS For the fourth quarter 2005, revenue increased 7 percent to $1.46 billion and net income was $93.6 million or $.41 per diluted share versus $.35 per diluted share in the prior year. For the full year, revenue increased 11 percent to $5.49 billion and net income was $526.6 million or $2.27 per diluted share versus $2.05 per diluted share in the prior year. During the quarter, the company recorded an after-tax restructuring charge of $20 million as part of its ongoing restructuring initiatives. Also during the quarter the company recorded a $56 million increase in its tax reserves as a result of an adverse court opinion that another company received related to the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance (COLI) investments. Excluding the restructuring charge in both periods, the tax reserve increase, and the legal settlement in the fourth quarter 2004, the company's fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $.74 versus $.71 in the prior year. For the full year 2005, the adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.70 versus $2.54 in 2004. The following table presents a reconciliation of earnings per share on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis and on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted EPS $0.74 $0.71 $2.70 $2.54 - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- ----------------- Restructuring ($0.09) ($0.30) ($0.16) ($0.43) - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- ----------------- Legal Settlement N/A ($0.05) N/A ($0.05) - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- ----------------- Foundation Contributions N/A N/A ($0.03) N/A - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- ----------------- Tax Reserve Increase ($0.24) N/A ($0.24) N/A - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- ----------------- GAAP EPS $0.41 $0.35 $2.27 $2.05 - ----------------------------- ------------ ------------ ---------------- -----------------
The company generated $107 million in cash from operations during the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million. Free cash flow is equal to cash from operations less capital expenditures of $76 million and excludes $77 million of contributions to the company's pension funds and $30 million in restructuring payments during the quarter. The company's cash from operations for the full year 2005 was $540 million. Free cash flow for the full year 2005 was $613 million. Free cash flow for the year is equal to cash from operations less capital expenditures of $292 million and excludes $79 million of restructuring payments, a $200 million IRS tax bond in the second quarter, $77 million of contributions to the company's pension funds in the fourth quarter, and $10 million contributed to the company's charitable foundations in the first quarter. During the quarter, the company used $69 million to repurchase 1.7 million of its shares, bringing the totals for the year to $259 million and 5.9 million shares, at an average price of $43.53 per share for the year. The company has $241 million of remaining authorization for future share repurchases.
The company's Board of Directors authorized an increase of its common stock dividend to an annualized rate of $1.28 per common share. A dividend of $.32 per share will be paid in the first quarter, a one cent increase from the prior year. Mr. Critelli noted, "Our higher rate of dividend increase this year reflects our confidence in the strength of our business and cash flow. This marks the twenty-fourth consecutive year that we have increased the dividend on our common stock." Global Mailstream Solutions includes worldwide revenue and related expenses from the sale, rental, and financing of mail finishing, mail creation, shipping, and production mail equipment; supplies; support services; payment solutions; and mailing and customer communication software. During the quarter, Global Mailstream Solutions revenue increased five percent to $1.04 billion and EBIT increased seven percent to $326 million, when compared with the fourth quarter of the prior year. In the U.S., the quarter's revenue growth continued to be favorably impacted by placements of networked digital mailing systems (especially small and mid-sized systems), mail creation equipment, and supplies. Also, there continued to be good demand for software products, as evidenced by the recent decision of Microsoft to integrate Group 1 software into its online mapping service. Outside of the U.S., revenue grew ten percent. These results include increased placements of mailing equipment with small businesses and increased sales of supplies. In addition, revenue growth benefited from the acquisitions of Groupe Mag and Danka Canada, but was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation for the first time in more than three years. Revenue growth was also negatively impacted by the comparison to very strong fourth quarter results in 2004. Global Business Services includes worldwide revenue and related expenses from facilities management contracts, reprographics, document management, and other value-added services to key vertical markets; and mail services operations, which include presort mail services, international outbound mail services, and direct mail marketing services.
For the quarter, Global Business Services reported revenue growth of 12 percent to $383 million and EBIT growth of 61 percent to $31 million compared with the fourth quarter of the prior year. The company's management services operation reported a three percent decline in revenue and a 23 percent improvement in EBIT. This reflects the company's ongoing focus on enhancing profitability for this business. Mail Services revenue grew 75 percent versus the fourth quarter last year as a result of the expansion of its pre-sort and mail consolidation network and the acquisition of Imagitas during the second quarter 2005. The EBIT margin was eight percent, which was a significant improvement compared with the prior year and reflects the company's continued integration of recently acquired sites, as well as the addition of higher margin Imagitas revenue. Imagitas benefited from the expansion last quarter of its marketing services for the motor vehicle registration process to a fifth state and the fourth-quarter launch of the catalog request form as an enhanced offering in the USPS move update kit. Capital Services revenue for the quarter increased nine percent to $34 million and EBIT increased 21 percent to $21 million as a result of asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to effect a sponsored spin-off of most of the Capital Services assets. Subject to customary regulatory approvals, the new entity will be an independent, publicly traded company consisting of most of the assets in the Capital Services segment. During the quarter, these assets contributed two cents per diluted share, compared with three cents in the fourth quarter 2004. Included in the quarter's results was a two cent per diluted share contribution from asset sales and a two cent per diluted share charge resulting primarily from the revision of the accounting for certain lease transactions, and favorable adjustments to the Capital Services tax provisions. In accordance with the revisions, the company grossed up the related lease assets and non-recourse debt on its consolidated balance sheets. In January the company received a favorable letter ruling from the IRS that the spin-off would be tax-free to its shareholders. The company is considering its options with respect to the Imagistics lease portfolio, which was to be part of the new entity. Any sale or other disposition of the Imagistics portfolio will be subject to a supplemental IRS letter ruling. The company continues to manage the Capital Services business to maximize its value to shareholders, as evidenced by the asset sales completed during the year, and continues to expect that the spin-off will occur in 2006.
2006 Outlook Looking forward to 2006, the company expects revenue growth in the range of four to six percent for the first quarter and full year, including the impact of strategic transactions announced to date and the expected negative impact from currency translation. The company's earnings expectations for the first quarter and full year 2006 are as follows:
Adjusted EPS $0.61 to $0.63 $0.58 $2.69 to $2.77 $2.51 - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------ Restructuring ($0.02 to $0.05) $0.04 ($0.05 to $0.10) ($0.16) - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------ Capital Services $0.01 to $0.03 $0.03 $0.05 to $0.07 $0.11 - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------ Foundation Contributions N/A ($0.03) N/A ($0.03) - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------ Tax Reserve Increase N/A N/A N/A ($0.24) - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------ GAAP EPS $0.57 to $0.64 $0.62 $2.64 to $2.79 $2.19 - --------------------------- ------------------- --------------- ------------------ ------------------
In the first quarter 2006, the company began expensing the cost of its stock option plans on a retroactive basis. Earnings per share amounts shown above for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005 include $0.02 per share for stock option expense. For the full year 2006, stock option expense is estimated in the range of $0.08 to $0.09, compared with $0.08 for 2005. While the company anticipates that the Capital Services business will be spun-off during 2006, it has included a full year of revenue and earnings contribution for its guidance. During 2006, the company expects to record after-tax restructuring charges related primarily to the completion of programs initiated in 2005. As noted above, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of the company's common stock of 32 cents per share, payable March 12, 2006, to stockholders of record on February 17, 2006. The board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 53 cents per share on the company's $2.12 convertible preference stock, payable April 1, 2006, to stockholders of record on March 15, 2006, and a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share on the company's 4% convertible cumulative preferred stock, payable May 1, 2006 to stockholders of record on April 14, 2006.
Management of Pitney Bowes will discuss the company's financial results in a conference call today scheduled for 5:00 p.m. EST. Instructions for listening to the conference call over the WEB are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's web site at http://www.pb.com/investorrelations. Pitney Bowes engineers the flow of communication. The company is a $5.5 billion global leader of mailstream solutions headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. For more information about the company, its products, services and solutions, visit www.pitneybowes.com. Pitney Bowes has presented in this earnings release diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis. Also, management has included a presentation of free cash flow on an adjusted basis and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Management believes this presentation provides a reasonable basis on which to present the adjusted financial information, and is provided to assist in investors' understanding of the company's results of operations. The company's financial results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the earnings per share and free cash flow results are adjusted to exclude the impact of special items such as restructuring charges and write downs of assets, which materially impact the comparability of the company's results of operations. Restructuring charges often reflect retooling of the business in an episodic way. Although they represent actual expenses to the company, these episodic charges might mask the periodic income associated with our business had there not been a retooling. The use of free cash flow has limitations. GAAP cash flow has the advantage of including all cash available to the company after actual expenditures for all purposes. Free cash flow permits a shareholder insight into the amount of cash that management could have available for discretionary uses if it made different decisions about employing its cash. It adjusts for long-term commitments such as capital expenditures, as well as special items like cash used for restructuring charges and contributions to its pension funds. Of course, each of these items uses cash that is not otherwise available to the company and are important expenditures. Management compensates for these limitations by using a combination of GAAP cash flow and free cash flow in doing its planning. The adjusted financial information and certain financial measures such as EBIT are intended to be more indicative of the ongoing operations and economic results of the company. EBIT excludes interest payments and taxes, both cash items, and as a result, has the effect of showing a greater amount of earnings than net income. The company uses EBIT, in addition to net income, for purposes of measuring the performance of its unit management team. The interest rates and tax rates applicable to the company generally are outside the control of management, and it can be useful to judge performance independent of those variables.
The adjusted financial information should be viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Further, our definition of this adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Pitney Bowes has provided in supplemental schedules attached for reference adjusted financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the differences between the adjusted financial measures with the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, except with respect to our guidance because it would not be meaningful. Additional reconciliation of adjusted financial measures to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP may be found at the company's web site http://www.pb.com/investorrelations in the Investor Relations section.
