Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as syndication agent, and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as documentation agents. The Facility amends and restates the 5-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 21, 2004 and replaces the First Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of May 20, 2005 which matured on the Effective Date.
The Facility provides for a total commitment of $1.5 billion, pursuant to which up to $1.465 billion may be borrowed in any combination of U.S. dollars, Pounds Sterling, euros and such other currencies as may be agreed upon, and up to $35.0 million of which may be borrowed only in U.S. dollars. The $1.5 billion total commitment includes a sublimit for the issuance of one or more letters of credit not exceeding an aggregate face amount of $200 million, denominated in U.S. dollars, Pounds Sterling, euros or such other currencies as may be agreed upon (subject to the foregoing currency limitations).
From and after the Effective Date, the Company may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and consent by the administrative agent, designate one or more of the Company's domestic or foreign subsidiaries as an additional borrower under the Facility. Following such designation and acceptance thereof by the administrative agent, the obligations of such additional borrower would be guaranteed by the Company.
The stated maturity date of the Facility is May 19, 2011, subject to the Company's right to request additional one year extensions of such maturity date, following notice by the Company and acceptance by the requisite number of lenders party to the Facility.
Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either a base rate or, at the Company's option, a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin dependant upon certain circumstances including the credit rating of the Company. In addition, the Company may request that the lenders offer to make absolute rate or LIBOR rate loans to the Company (or, if applicable, a subsidiary borrower) subject to such lower interest rate to which a lender may agree.
The Facility contains covenants that will limit the ability of the Company and, in some cases, its domestic subsidiaries, to, among other things, create certain liens on its, or their, properties.
The Facility is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Facility.

(ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto and shall specify: (A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest Period therefor; (B) the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount shall be at least $15,000,000 (or a larger multiple of $1,000,000); provided that the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans for which a Bank submits Money Market Quotes (x) may be greater or less than the Commitment of such Bank but (y) may not exceed the principal amount of the Money Market Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which offers were requested; (C) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, the margin above or below the applicable Eurocurrency Rate (the "LIBO Margin") offered for each such Money Market Loan, expressed as a percentage (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from the applicable Eurocurrency Rate; (D) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) offered for each such Money Market Loan (the "Absolute Rate"); and (E) the identity of the quoting Bank. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Company, no Money Market Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Money Market Quote Request and, in particular, no Money Market Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Company of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which such Money Market Quote is being made, provided that the submission by any Bank containing more than one Money Market Quote may be conditioned on the Company not accepting offers contained in such submission that would result in such Bank making Money Market Loans pursuant thereto in excess of a specified aggregate amount (the "Money Market Loan Limit"). (d) The Administrative Agent shall (x) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, as promptly as practicable after the Money Market Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 10:15 a.m. New York time on the Money Market Quotation Date) or (y) in the case of a LIBOR Auction, by 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day a Money Market Quote is submitted, notify the Company of the terms (i) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.03(c) hereof and (ii) of any Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money
-24- Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Company shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Money Market Borrowing for which offers have been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and LIBO Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered by each Bank (identifying the Bank that made each Money Market Quote). (e) Not later than 11:00 a.m. New York time on (x) the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the Money Market Quotation Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Company and the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks, may agree), the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.03(d) hereof (which notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers from each Bank for each Interest Period that are accepted, it being understood that the failure of the Company to give such notice by such time shall constitute nonacceptance) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Bank. The notice from the Administrative Agent shall also specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that were accepted and the lowest and highest LIBO Margins and Absolute Rates that were accepted for each Interest Period. The Company may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part (provided that any Money Market Quote accepted in part shall be at least $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000); provided that: (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing shall be at least $15,000,000 (or a larger multiple of $1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section 2.03(a) hereof to be violated; (iii) acceptance of offers may, subject to clause (v) below, be made only in ascending order of LIBO Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, in each case beginning with the lowest rate so offered; (iv) the Company may not accept any offer where the Administrative Agent has advised the Company that such offer fails to comply with Section 2.03(c)(ii) hereof or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.03(a) hereof); and (v) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing from any Bank may not exceed any applicable Money Market Loan Limit of such Bank. The Company may accept offers made by two or more Banks with the same LIBO Margins or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, in part, provided that the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Company among such Banks as nearly as possible (in amounts of at least $5,000,000 or larger multiples of $1,000,000) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Determinations by
-25- the Company of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has been accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.03 shall, not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on the date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent at an account designated by the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, for account of the Company. The amount so received by the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available to the Company on such date by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the Company designated by the Company and maintained with JPMCB at its principal office. (g) Except for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated in Section 2.04(b) hereof, the amount of any Money Market Loan made by any Bank shall not constitute a utilization of such Bank's Commitment. 2.04 Changes of Commitments. (a) The aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be automatically reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date. (b) The Company shall have the right at any time or from time to time (i) so long as no Syndicated Loans or Money Market Loans or Letters of Credit are outstanding, to terminate the Commitments and (ii) to reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitments of either Class (for which purpose use of the Commitments of a Class shall be deemed to include the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans made by any Bank of such Class); provided that (x) the Company shall give notice of each such termination or reduction as provided in Section 4.05 hereof and (y) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $15,000,000 (or whole multiples thereof) or the unused amount of the Commitments. (c) The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not be reinstated. 2.05 Certain Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank a facility fee on the daily amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused), for the period from and including the Effective Date to but not including the earlier of the date such Commitment is terminated and the Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate; provided that if such Bank shall have any outstanding Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Bank's Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Bank ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in Dollars in arrears on each Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and on the earlier of the date on which the Commitments are terminated and the Commitment Termination Date; provided that
-26- any facility fee accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit of each Class, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of such Bank's LC Exposure of such Class (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Bank's Commitment of such Class terminates and the date on which such Bank ceases to have any LC Exposure of such Class, and (ii) to the respective Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate per annum as agreed in writing between the Company and such Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder, which shall be payable in Dollars or the Currency of such Letter of Credit as separately agreed upon between the Company and such Issuing Bank. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable with respect to Letters of Credit of a Class on the date on which the Commitments of such Class terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which such Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 30 days after demand. 2.06 Lending Offices. The Loans of each Type and Currency made by each Bank shall be made and maintained at such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for Loans of such Type and Currency. 2.07 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank, and (except as otherwise provided in Section 4.06 hereof) no Bank shall have any obligation to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank for the failure by such Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Bank. The amounts payable by any Borrower at any time hereunder and under the Notes to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and the Notes, and it shall not be necessary for any other Bank or the Administrative Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes. 2.08 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain, in accordance with its usual practice, records evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Bank hereunder, including the amounts of
-27- principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the applicable Borrower to which such Loan was made, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from any Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Banks and each Bank's share thereof; provided that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each applicable Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Any Bank may request that the Syndicated Loans made by such Bank to any Borrower shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of such Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, payable to such Bank in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Commitment as originally in effect and otherwise duly completed. (c) Any Bank may request that the Money Market Loans made by such Bank to the Company shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, payable to such Bank and otherwise duly completed. (d) The date, amount, Type, Currency, interest rate and duration of Interest Period of each Loan of each Class made by each Bank to any Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank on its books and, prior to any transfer of the Note evidencing the Loans of such Class held by it, endorsed by such Bank on the schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that the failure of such Bank to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of each applicable Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under such Note in respect of such Loans. (e) No Bank shall be entitled to have its Notes (if any) substituted or exchanged for any reason, or subdivided for promissory notes of lesser denominations, except in connection with (x) a permitted assignment of all or any portion of such Bank's Commitment, Loans and Notes pursuant to Section 11.06 hereof or (y) an increase in such Bank's Commitment pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof (and, if requested by any Bank, the Company agrees so to exchange any Note). (f) Any Additional Bank or Additional Commitment Bank may request that any Syndicated Loans or Money Market Loans made by such Additional Bank or Additional Commitment Bank to any Borrower shall each be evidenced by a single promissory note of such Borrower, substantially in the forms of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto, respectively, dated the effective date of such Banks' Commitment, and otherwise complying with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, respectively. (g) Any Bank that ceases to be a Bank pursuant to Section 5.06 hereof or any non-extending Bank pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof shall promptly return its Notes (if any) to the Company after termination of its Commitment and payment to it of all principal and interest owing to it hereunder and under its Notes.
-28- 2.09 Optional Prepayments and Conversions or Continuations of Loans. (a) Subject to Sections 4.04 and 5.04 hereof, each Borrower shall have the right to prepay Syndicated Loans or to Convert Syndicated Loans of one Type that are denominated in Dollars into Syndicated Loans of another Type that are denominated in Dollars or Continue Syndicated Loans of one Type and Currency as Syndicated Loans of the same Type and Currency, at any time or from time to time, provided that: (a) the applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of each such prepayment or Conversion or Continuation as provided in Section 4.05 hereof (and, upon the date specified in any such notice of prepayment, the amount to be prepaid shall become due and payable hereunder); (b) a Syndicated Loan of a Class may only be Continued as, or Converted to, a Syndicated Loan of the same Class; (c) a Syndicated Loan denominated in one Currency may not be Continued as, or Converted to, a Syndicated Loan in a different Currency; (d) a Syndicated Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be Converted to a Loan of a different Type; and (e) no Syndicated Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency may be Continued if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure of all of the Multicurrency Banks would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments at such time. (b) No Money Market Loan may be prepaid without the consent of the Bank holding such Money Market Loan. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.09, and without limiting the rights and remedies of the Banks under Section 9 hereof, in the event that any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may (and at the request of the Majority Banks or, with respect to any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency, the Majority Multicurrency Banks, shall) (i) suspend the right of the Borrowers to Convert any Loan denominated in Dollars into a Eurocurrency Loan, or to Continue any Loan denominated in Dollars as a Eurocurrency Loan, in which event all Loans denominated in Dollars shall be Converted (on the last day of the respective Interest Period therefor) or Continued, as the case may be, as Base Rate Loans and/or (ii) suspend the right of the Company to have any Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency to have an Interest Period of more than one month's duration. 2.10 Increase in Commitments. (a) The Company shall have the right from time to time, without the consent of the Banks but with the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to effect an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments of a Class by adding as a Bank with a new Commitment of such Class any Person which is not then a Bank (each an "Additional Bank") and/or by having a Bank increase its Commitments of such Class hereunder (each an "Increasing Bank"). (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be effective unless: (i) each Additional Bank shall have entered into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent pursuant to which
-29- such Additional Bank shall undertake a Commitment of the relevant Class (and upon the effectiveness thereof such Additional Bank shall be a "Bank" for all purposes of this Agreement) and each Increasing Bank shall have entered into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Increasing Bank shall agree to increase its Commitment of a Class (and upon the effectiveness thereof such Bank's Commitment of such Class shall be so increased); (ii) the Company shall have given the Administrative Agent notice of such increase at least three Business Days prior to the proposed effective date for such increase (the "Commitment Increase Date"); (iii) after giving effect to such increase, the aggregate Commitments shall not exceed $2,000,000,000; (iv) no Bank's Commitment shall be increased without the prior express written consent of such Bank; (v) on the relevant Commitment Increase Date, no Syndicated Loans or Letters of Credit of the relevant Class shall be outstanding hereunder and no notice of borrowing of Syndicated Loans or request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit of such Class hereunder shall be pending; (vi) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on and as of the date of the relevant notice referred to in clause (ii) above or on the relevant Commitment Increase Date; and (vii) each Additional Bank and Increasing Bank shall have received evidence of the corporate authority of the Borrowers and opinions of counsel as such Bank may reasonably request. 2.11 Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01 hereof, (i) the Company and any Domestic Subsidiary Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period under the Dollar Commitments, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for the account of the Company or such Domestic Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, and (ii) any Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period under the Multicurrency Commitments, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or any Agreed Foreign Currency for the account of such Borrower, in each case in such form as is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its reasonable determination. Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the respective Issuing
-30- Bank) to an Issuing Bank selected by it and to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying whether such Letter of Credit is issued under the Dollar Commitments or the Multicurrency Commitments, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.11(d) hereof), the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the respective Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the applicable Borrower to, or entered into by the applicable Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. (c) Limitations on Amounts. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $200,000,000, (ii) the aggregate Dollar Credit Exposure of all of the Dollar Banks shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments and (iii) the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposures of all of the Multicurrency Banks shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments. (d) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date; provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for automatic renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above). (e) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit of any Class (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit of any Class increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank or the Banks of such Class, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Bank of such Class, and each such Bank hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Bank's Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit of any Class is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any such Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Bank hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the respective Issuing Bank, such Bank's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by an Issuing
-31- Bank promptly upon the request of such Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the applicable Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason; provided that none of the Banks of one Class shall have any such obligation in respect of Letters of Credit of another Class. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 hereof with respect to Loans made by such Bank (and Section 2.02 hereof shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Banks), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the respective Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Banks. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the respective Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Banks have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Banks and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. (f) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on (i) the Business Day that the applicable Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., Local Time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000 and such Letter of Credit is denominated in Dollars, the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof that such payment be financed with a Base Rate Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Loan. Each payment received hereunder by the Administrative Agent for account of any Issuing Bank in respect of a Letter of Credit shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Issuing Bank. If the applicable Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit fails to make such payment when due and shall not have requested a Base Rate Loan in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Bank of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Bank's Applicable Percentage thereof, if any. (g) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of each Borrower to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.11(f) hereof shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the respective
-32- Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.11, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of such Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Banks nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the respective Issuing Bank or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers and the Banks to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers and the Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers or the Banks that are caused by such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that: (i) an Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (ii) an Issuing Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an Issuing Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). (h) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Banks with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
-33- (i) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on or before the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans; provided that, if the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.11(f) hereof, then the second and third sentences of Section 3.02 hereof shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(e) hereof to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for account of such Bank to the extent of such payment. (j) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Banks of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(b) hereof. From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous Issuing Bank, or such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (k) Reports by Issuing Banks to Administrative Agent. On the Business Day following each Quarterly Date (and/or such other times as the Administrative Agent shall request), each Issuing Bank shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (and, if requested by any Bank, the Administrative Agent shall furnish a copy to such Bank) a report setting forth (i) the issuance and expiration dates, the face amount and Currency, the Class and the applicable account party of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the most recently completed fiscal quarter (or, if so requested by the Administrative Agent, the most recently completed month), (ii) the aggregate undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank that are outstanding as of such date and (iii) the aggregate amount of all LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank that have not been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrowers prior to such date. 2.12 Mandatory Prepayments in respect of Currency Fluctuations. On the first Business Day of each calendar month (or at such other times as the Majority Multicurrency Banks may request (but not more frequently than once in any rolling three month period)), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure of all of the Multicurrency Banks (including the Dollar Equivalent of any portion thereof that is denominated in Foreign Currencies). For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding
-34- principal amount of any Syndicated Loan or the undrawn face amount of any Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan, as of the relevant determination date. Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks and the Company thereof. If on the date of such determination the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposures of all of the Multicurrency Banks exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments as then in effect, then, if requested by the Majority Multicurrency Banks (through the Administrative Agent), the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiary Borrowers to, prepay the Syndicated Loans under the Multicurrency Commitments (and/or provide cash cover for Multicurrency LC Exposures, as specified in Section 9) in such amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto the aggregate Multicurrency Credit Exposure of all of the Multicurrency Banks do not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments. Any payment pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied, first, to prepay such Syndicated Loans outstanding and next, to provide cover for Multicurrency LC Exposures. Any such payment shall be accompanied by accrued interest thereon as provided in Section 3.02 hereof and by any amounts payable under Section 5.04 hereof. 2.13 Extension of Commitment Termination Date. (a) The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks) not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to each anniversary of the Effective Date (such anniversary date, the "Extension Effective Date"), request (each, an "Extension Request") that the Banks extend the Commitment Termination Date then in effect (the "Existing Commitment Termination Date") for an additional one year. Each Bank, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day (or such later day as shall be acceptable to the Company) following the date of such Company's notice, advise the Company and the Administrative Agent whether or not such Bank agrees to such extension; provided that any Bank that does not so advise the Company shall be deemed to have rejected such Extension Request. The election of any Bank to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Bank to so agree. (b) The Company shall have the right at any time on or prior to the relevant Extension Effective Date, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to replace any non-extending Bank with, and otherwise add to this Agreement, one or more Additional Commitment Banks. Each Additional Commitment Bank shall enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Bank shall, effective as of the Extension Effective Date, provide a Commitment or (if such Additional Commitment Bank is an existing Bank) increase its Commitment in the amount specified therein and (if not an existing Bank) become a Bank hereunder, so long as any amounts payable to the relevant non-extending Bank being replaced are paid in full. (c) If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Banks that have agreed in connection with any Extension Request to extend the Existing Commitment Termination Date and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Bank(s) shall be at least 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Extension Effective Date, then, effective as of the Extension Effective Date, the Commitment Termination Date, but
-35- only with respect to the Commitment of each Bank that has agreed to so extend its Commitment and of each Additional Commitment Bank, shall be extended to the date falling one year after the then Existing Commitment Termination Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, such Commitment Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Bank shall thereupon become a "Bank" for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Existing Termination Date shall not be effective with respect to any Bank unless as of the relevant Extension Date (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the representations and warranties of each Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true on and as of such date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation and warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date) (and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certification to such effect from a senior financial officer of the Company, together with such evidence and other related documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request with respect to the authorization of the Company and other Borrowers of the extension and their respective obligations hereunder). (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Bank that has not approved any Extension Request, the Commitment Termination Date for such Bank shall remain unchanged (and the Commitment (including its obligation in respect of any participation in respect of any Letter of Credit) of such Bank shall terminate, and the Loans made by such Bank hereunder shall mature, and shall be payable by the applicable Borrowers, on such date). Section 3. Payments of Principal and Interest. 3.01 Repayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank the principal of each Syndicated Loan made by such Bank to such Borrower, and each such Syndicated Loan shall mature, on the Commitment Termination Date. (b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank that makes a Money Market Loan the principal of such Money Market Loan, and such Money Market Loan shall mature, on the last day of the Interest Period for such Money Market Loan. 3.02 Interest. Each Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to such Borrower by such Bank for the period from and including the date of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: (a) if such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time) plus the Applicable Additional Margin (if any);
-36- (b) if such Loan is a Eurocurrency Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan for the relevant Interest Period therefor plus the Applicable Rate plus the Applicable Additional Margin (if any); (c) if such Loan is a LIBOR Market Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor plus (or minus) the LIBO Margin quoted by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03 hereof; and (d) if such Loan is an Absolute Rate Loan, the Absolute Rate for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor quoted by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank interest at the applicable Post-Default Rate on any principal of any Loan made to such Borrower by such Bank and on any other amount payable by such Borrower hereunder or under the Notes of such Borrower held by such Bank to or for account of such Bank, that shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), for the period from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date the same is paid in full. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable (i) on the last day of the Interest Period therefor and, if such Interest Period is longer than 90 days (in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan) or three months (in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan), at 90-day or three-month intervals, respectively, following the first day of such Interest Period, and (ii) in the case of any Loan, upon the payment or prepayment thereof (but only on the principal amount so paid or prepaid), except that interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand. Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks to which such interest is payable and to the Company.

All amounts owing under this Agreement (including facility
-37- fees, payments required under Section 5.01 hereof, and payments required under Section 5.04 hereof relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including (i) principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 5.04 hereof, or (ii) any reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements made pursuant to Letters of Credit denominated in any Foreign Currency, interest on such LC Disbursements and fees required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.05(c) hereof which the applicable Borrower and applicable Issuing Bank have agreed shall be paid in any Foreign Currency (to the extent payable in such Foreign Currency), which in the case of each amount specified in clause (i) and (ii), are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise) or shall fail to pay any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when due, the unpaid portion of such Loan or reimbursement obligation shall, if such Loan or reimbursement obligation is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, in the case of any such Loan, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof and such principal or reimbursement obligation shall be payable on demand; and if any Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars or on any LC Disbursement made pursuant to a Letter of Credit that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, in the case of any such Loan, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand. (b) Any Bank or any Issuing Bank for whose account any such payment is to be made may (but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment that is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of any Borrower with such Bank or such Issuing Bank (with notice to the applicable Borrower, the Company (without duplication) and the Administrative Agent), provided that such Bank's or such Issuing Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof. (c) The Company shall, at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank or any Issuing Bank, specify to the Administrative Agent (which shall so notify the intended recipient(s) thereof) the Loans of a Class or other amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Company fails to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks or the relevant Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks, as the case may be, for application in such manner, subject to Section 4.02 hereof, as it or the Majority Banks may determine to be appropriate). (d) Each payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by the Administrative Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds and in the Currency in which it was received, for account
-38- of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made. (e) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension. (f) With respect to the payment by any Borrower of any amount denominated in any Foreign Currency made in accordance with Section 4.01(a) hereof, such Borrower shall not be liable to any Bank or any Issuing Bank for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, by the Administrative Agent in the crediting or remitting of any such amount to any Bank or any Issuing Bank. With respect to the payment by the Administrative Agent of any amount denominated in any Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any Borrower, any Bank or any Issuing Bank in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount required by this Agreement to be paid by the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent shall have taken all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds (in such Foreign Currency) to the account of any Borrower, any Bank or any Issuing Bank in the Principal Financial Center with respect to such Foreign Currency which the relevant Borrower, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have specified for such purpose. For the purposes of this paragraph, "all relevant steps" means all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Administrative Agent may from time to time determine for the purpose of clearing or settling payments in such Foreign Currency. 4.02 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, (a) each borrowing of Syndicated Loans of a particular Class from the Banks under Section 2.01 hereof shall be made from the Banks of such Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.04 hereof shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Banks of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (b) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.04 hereof, Eurocurrency Loans of a Class having the same Interest Period shall be allocated pro rata among the Banks of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of making Eurocurrency Loans) or their respective Eurocurrency Loans having such Interest Period (in the case of Conversions and Continuation of Eurocurrency Loans); (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrowers shall be made for account of the Banks of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class held by them; (d) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of such Class by the Borrowers shall be made for account of the Banks of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Banks and (e) each payment of fees under Section 2.05 hereof shall be made for account of the Banks entitled thereto, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (or their respective Credit Exposure, as applicable).
-39- 4.03 Computations. All interest hereunder and fees under Section 2.05 hereof shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Base Rate at times when the Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate and interest on all Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 4.04 Minimum Amounts. Except for prepayments made pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof, each borrowing, Conversion and partial prepayment of principal of (x) Base Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $1,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 (it being understood that reimbursement obligations in respect of LC Disbursements may be financed with Base Rate Loans in amounts that are not in such multiples of $1,000,000) and (y) Eurocurrency Loans shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $15,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 (borrowings, Conversions or prepayments of or into Loans of different Types or, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, having different Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings, Conversions and prepayments for purposes of the foregoing, one for each Type or Interest Period), provided that the aggregate principal amount of Eurocurrency Loans having the same Interest Period shall be in an amount at least equal to $15,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 and, if any Eurocurrency Loans would otherwise be in a lesser principal amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during such period. 4.05 Certain Notices. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03 hereof with respect to Money Market Loans, notices of termination or reductions of the Commitments and of borrowings, Conversions, Continuations and optional prepayments of Loans, of Types of Loans, of the Currency in which Syndicated Loans are to be denominated and of the duration of Interest Periods shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. New York time (or, in the case of any such notice relating to a Syndicated Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, 11:00 a.m. Local Time) on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant termination, reduction, borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or prepayment or the first day of such Interest Period specified below:
-40-
denominated in Dollars 3 Borrowing or prepayment of, Continuation as or duration of Interest Period for, Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency 5
Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of the Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment shall specify the Loans to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the amount (subject to Section 4.04 hereof), Class and Type of each Loan to be borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the date of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment (which shall be a Business Day). Each such notice of borrowing of Syndicated Loans shall specify the Currency in which such Loans are to be denominated. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of each such notice. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to select the Currency of a Syndicated Loan, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Loan will be denominated in Dollars unless such Loan is a Continuation of an existing Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, in which case such Syndicated Loan will be a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in such Foreign Currency. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to select the Type of a Loan denominated in Dollars, or the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Loan (if outstanding as a Eurocurrency Loan) will be automatically Converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to select the Type of a Syndicated Loan but has selected a Foreign Currency as the Currency for such Loan, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Syndicated Loan will be made as a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in such Foreign Currency. In the event that the applicable Borrower fails to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Borrower will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration for such Loan. 4.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or a Borrower (the "Payor") prior to the time on which the Payor is to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by such Bank hereunder or (in the case of a Borrower) a payment to the Administrative Agent for account of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date; and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date (the "Advance Date")
-41- such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day and, if such recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with interest as aforesaid, provided that if neither the recipient(s) nor the Payor shall return the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days of the Advance Date, then, retroactively to the Advance Date, the Payor and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay interest on the Required Payment as follows: (i) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment to be made by any Borrower to the Banks, such Borrower and the Banks shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required Payment at the Post-Default Rate (without duplication of the obligation of such Borrower under Section 3.02 hereof to pay interest on the Required Payment at the Post-Default Rate), it being understood that the return by the recipient(s) of the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent shall not limit such obligation of such Borrower under Section 3.02 hereof to pay interest at the Post-Default Rate in respect of the Required Payment; and (ii) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of a Loan to be made by the Banks to any Borrower, the Payor and such Borrower shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required Payment pursuant to whichever of the rates specified in Section 3.02 hereof is applicable to the Type of such Loan, it being understood that the return by such Borrower of the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent shall not limit any claim such Borrower may have against the Payor in respect of such Required Payment. 4.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc. (a) Each Borrower agrees that, in addition to (and without limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim a Bank or an Issuing Bank may otherwise have, each Bank and each Issuing Bank shall be entitled, at its option (to the fullest extent permitted by law), to set off and apply any deposit (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), or other indebtedness, held by it for the credit or account of such Borrower at any of its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any of such Bank's Loans, any unreimbursed LC Disbursements owing to it or any other amount payable to such Bank or such Issuing Bank hereunder, that is not paid when due (regardless of whether such deposit or other indebtedness are then due to such Borrower), in which case it shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof, provided that such Bank's or such Issuing Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity thereof. (b) If any Bank shall obtain from any Borrower payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan of any Class owing to it or payment of any other amount under this Agreement through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise (other than from the Administrative Agent as provided herein), and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percentage of the principal of or interest on the Loans of such Class or such other amounts then due hereunder by the Borrowers to such Bank than the percentage received by any other Bank, it shall promptly purchase from
-42- such other Banks participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans of such Class or such other amounts, respectively, owing to such other Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses that may be incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans of such Class or such other amounts, respectively, owing to each of the Banks. To such end all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. (c) Each Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing such a participation (or direct interest) may exercise all rights of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may be) owing to such Bank in the amount of such participation. (d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrowers. If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a set-off to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Bank shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section 4.07 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc. 5.01 Additional Costs. (a) The Company shall pay in Dollars directly to each Bank from time to time such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs that such Bank reasonably determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make any Fixed Rate Loans hereunder to any Borrower, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation to any Borrower (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change that: (i) subjects any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans) to any tax, duty or other charge in respect of such Loans or its Notes or changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of such Loans (excluding changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or of such Applicable Lending Office by the jurisdiction in which such Bank has its principal office or such Applicable Lending Office); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (other than, in the case of any Bank for any period as to which the Company is required
-43- to pay any amount under paragraph (d) of this Section 5.01, the reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D therein referred to) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Bank (including, without limitation, any of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definitions of "Eurocurrency Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such Bank (including, without limitation, the Commitment of such Bank hereunder); or (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities) or its Commitment. If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this Section 5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Bank thereafter to make or Continue Eurocurrency Loans, or Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Loans, until the Regulatory Change giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case (x) all such Eurocurrency Loans then outstanding to any Borrower (other than any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the current Interest Period(s) therefor and (y) all such Eurocurrency Loans then outstanding to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be prepaid on the last day(s) of the current Interest Period(s) therefor), provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Bank to receive the compensation so requested. (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication of any other requirement in this Section 5), if any Bank determines that any Regulatory Change regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital or on the capital of such Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Banks to a level below that which such Bank or such Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Bank's policies and the policies of such Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay in Dollars to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or such Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Each Bank shall notify the Company of any event occurring after the date hereof entitling such Bank to compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 45 days, after such Bank obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided that (i) if any Bank fails to give such notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Bank shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01 for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Bank does give such notice and (ii) each Bank will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of such Bank affected by such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United States of America. Each Bank will furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank for compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01. Determinations and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the effect of any
-44- Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5.01, or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5.01, on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this Section 5.01, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis. (d) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, the Company shall pay in Dollars to each Bank on the last day of each Interest Period for each Fixed Rate Loan to any Borrower (other than any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) so long as such Bank is maintaining reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D (or so long as such Bank is, by reason of any Regulatory Change, maintaining reserves against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Fixed Rate Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank that includes any Fixed Rate Loans) an additional amount (determined by such Bank and notified to the Company through the Administrative Agent) equal to the product of the following for each Fixed Rate Loan for each day during such Interest Period: (i) the principal amount of such Fixed Rate Loan outstanding on such day; and (ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest accrues on such Fixed Rate Loan for such Interest Period as provided in this Agreement (less the Applicable Rate) and the denominator of which is one minus the effective rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed on such Bank on such day minus (y) such numerator; and (iii) 1/360. (e) With respect to any change by a Bank of its Applicable Lending Office or any assignment by a Bank under Section 11.06(b) hereof, the Bank changing such office or assignee Bank (as the case may be) shall not be entitled to any compensation under this Section 5.01 with respect to any Additional Costs resulting from any Regulatory Change that occurred prior to the date of such assignment or such change of office. 5.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits in the relevant Currency referred to in the definition of "Eurocurrency Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for either Type of Fixed Rate Loans denominated in such Currency as provided herein; or (b) the Majority Banks determine (or any Bank that has outstanding a Money Market Quote with respect to a LIBOR Market Loan determines), which determination shall be conclusive, and notify (or notifies, as the case may be) the Administrative Agent
-45- that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "Eurocurrency Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of interest for Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency (or LIBOR Market Loans, as the case may be) for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to such Banks (or to such quoting Bank) of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency or LIBOR Market Loans, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give the Company and each Bank prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks (or such quoting Bank) shall be under no obligation to make additional Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency (or the LIBOR Market Loan for which such Quote was made, as the case may be), to Continue Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Loans, and the applicable Borrower shall, on the last day of the then current Interest Period for the outstanding Eurocurrency Loans, either prepay such Loans or Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.09 hereof. 5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans (or to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a particular Currency) hereunder (and, in the sole opinion of such Bank, the designation of a different Applicable Lending Office would either not avoid such unlawfulness or would be disadvantageous to such Bank), then such Bank shall promptly notify the Company thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Bank's obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any Type into, Eurocurrency Loans (or to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a particular Currency, as the case may be) shall be suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain Eurocurrency Loans (Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency) (in which case (x) all such Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency then outstanding to any Borrower (other than any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the current Interest Period(s) therefor (or on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) if such earlier date is required by law) and (y) all such Eurocurrency Loans denominated in such Currency then outstanding to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be prepaid on the last day(s) of the current Interest Period(s) therefor (or on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) if such earlier date is required by law)), and such Bank shall no longer be obligated to make any LIBOR Market Loan (or any LIBOR Market Loan denominated in such Currency, as the case may be) that it has offered to make. 5.04 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that such Bank determines is attributable to: (a) any payment, mandatory or optional prepayment or Conversion of a Fixed Rate Loan or an Absolute Rate Loan made by such Bank to any Borrower for any reason
-46- (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 9 hereof) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or (b) any failure by any Borrower for any reason other than if a Bank's obligation to make or Continue Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in Section 6 hereof to be satisfied) to borrow a Fixed Rate Loan or an Absolute Rate Loan (with respect to which, in the case of a Money Market Loan, the Company has accepted a Money Market Quote) from such Bank on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice of borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02 or 2.03(b) hereof or to prepay a Fixed Rate Loan on the date for such prepayment, as specified in the relevant notice of prepayment. Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, not borrowed or not prepaid for the period (the "relevant period") from the date of such payment, prepayment, failure to borrow or failure to prepay to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein less the Applicable Rate over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the London interbank market (if such Loan is a Fixed Rate Loan) or the United States of America secondary certificate of deposit market (if such Loan is an Absolute Rate Loan) for deposits denominated in the Currency of such Loan of leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to the relevant period (as reasonably determined by such Bank). 5.05 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of each obligation of each Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.05) the Administrative Agent or Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes in respect of such Borrower to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, within 10 days after written demand to such Borrower therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes in respect of such Borrower (including Indemnified Taxes or
-47- Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.05) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount (with reasonable supporting details) of such payment or liability delivered to any Borrower by a Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Foreign Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the laws of the United States of America, or any treaty with the United States of America with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or as reasonably requested by the Company, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Without limiting the foregoing, each Foreign Bank, with respect to Loans made to the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary, or Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Company, shall deliver to the Company and each such Subsidiary Borrower, with copies to the Administrative Agent, two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming complete exemption from the withholding of U.S. federal income tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest," a certificate reasonably acceptable to the Company representing that such Foreign Bank is not (i) a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, (ii) a ten-percent shareholder of the Company (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Company (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in all cases properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Bank claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding of U.S. federal income tax on all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company or (if applicable) such Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document. Such forms shall be delivered by each such Foreign Bank on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement. In addition, each such Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms immediately prior to the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Bank. Each such Foreign Bank shall promptly notify the Company and (if applicable) such Subsidiary Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Person(s) to whom such certificate was previously delivered (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). (f) If the Administrative Agent or any Bank is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in the rate of the imposition, deduction or withholding of any Indemnified Tax or
-48- Other Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is organized or engaged in business, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments by such Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent or such Bank (as the case may be) shall deliver to such Subsidiary Borrower or the relevant Governmental Authority, in the manner and at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or as reasonably requested by the Company (at least 60 days prior to the due date required for submission thereof), such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without the imposition, deduction or withholding of such Indemnified Tax or Other Tax or at a reduced rate, provided that the Administrative Agent or such Bank is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in its reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice its commercial or legal position or require disclosure of information it considers confidential or proprietary. (g) If the Administrative Agent, a Bank or an Issuing Bank determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.05, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 5.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, incurred in connection therewith and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority, other than any such penalties, interest or other charges attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank, as applicable) to the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Bank or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 5.05 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential or proprietary) to any Borrower or any other Person. 5.06 Replacement of Banks. If any Bank requests compensation pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.05 hereof, or any Bank's obligation to make or Continue Loans of any Type, or to Convert Loans of any Type into the other Type of Loan, shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof (any such Bank requesting such compensation, or whose obligations are so suspended, being herein called a "Requesting Bank"), the Company, upon three Business Days' notice to such Bank and the Administrative Agent, may, at its sole expense and effort, require that such Requesting Bank transfer all of its right, title and interest under this Agreement and such Requesting Bank's Notes without recourse to any bank or other financial institution (a "Proposed Bank") identified by the Company that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (i) if such Proposed Bank agrees to assume all of the obligations of such Requesting Bank hereunder, and to purchase all of such Requesting Bank's Loans hereunder for consideration equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Requesting Bank's Loans, together
-49- with interest thereon to the date of such purchase, and arrangements satisfactory to the Requesting Bank are made for payment to such Requesting Bank of all other amounts payable hereunder to such Requesting Bank on or prior to the date of such transfer (including any fees accrued hereunder and any amounts that would be payable under Section 5.04 hereof as if all of such Requesting Bank's Loans were being prepaid in full on such date) and (ii) if such Requesting Bank has requested compensation pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.05 hereof, such Proposed Bank's aggregate requested compensation, if any, pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.05 hereof with respect to such Requesting Bank's Loans is lower than that of the Requesting Bank. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.06(b) hereof, such Proposed Bank shall be a "Bank" for all purposes hereunder. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Company hereunder, the agreements of the Company contained in Sections 5.01, 5.05 and 11.03 hereof (without duplication of any payments made to such Requesting Bank by the Company or the Proposed Bank) shall survive for the benefit of such Requesting Bank under this Section 5.06 with respect to the time prior to such replacement. 5.07 Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 5.01 hereof (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued hereunder and the result shall be to increase the cost to any Issuing Bank or any Bank of issuing (or purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit hereunder or reduce any amount receivable by any Issuing Bank or any Bank hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit (which increases in cost, or reductions in amount receivable, shall be the result of such Issuing Bank's or such Banks' reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then, upon demand by such Issuing Bank or such Bank (through the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay immediately to the Administrative Agent for account of such Issuing Bank or such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Issuing Bank or such Bank, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Bank for such increased costs or reductions in amount. Each Issuing Bank and each Bank shall notify the Company of any event occurring after the date hereof entitling such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, to compensation under this Section 5.07 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 45 days, after such Issuing Bank or such Bank obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided that if any Issuing Bank or any Bank fails to give such notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Issuing Bank or such Bank shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.07 in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.07 for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Issuing Bank or such Bank does give such notice. Each Issuing Bank and each Bank will furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, for compensation under this Section 5.07. Determinations and allocations by any Issuing Bank or any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.07 of the effect of any Regulatory Change and of the amounts required to compensate such Issuing Bank or Bank under this Section 5.07 shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis.

Except for action expressly required of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 10.05 hereof against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 10.08 Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent.

-67- further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 11.02 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications provided for herein (including, without limitation, any modifications of, or waivers, requests or consents under, this Agreement) shall be given or made in writing (including, without limitation, by telecopy), or, with respect to notices given pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof, by telephone, confirmed in writing by telecopier by the close of business on the day the notice is given, delivered (or telephoned, as the case may be) to the intended recipient (in the case of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent) at the "Address for Notices" specified below its name on the signature pages hereof and (in the case of each Bank) at its address set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or such other address as shall be designated by a Bank in a notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company; or, as to any party other than a Bank, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to each other party. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by telecopier or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon receipt, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

The Administrative Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. 11.03 Expenses, Etc. The Company agrees to pay or reimburse each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent for: (a) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, special New York counsel to JPMCB) in connection with (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and the extensions of credit hereunder and (ii) the negotiation or preparation of any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement or any of the Notes (whether or not consummated); (b) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Banks and the Administrative Agent (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with (i) any Event of Default and any enforcement or collection proceedings resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, all manner of participation in or other involvement with (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, foreclosure, winding up or liquidation proceedings, (y) judicial or regulatory proceedings and (z) workout, restructuring or other negotiations or proceedings (whether or not the workout, restructuring or transaction contemplated thereby is consummated) and (ii) the enforcement of this Section 11.03; and (c) all transfer, stamp, documentary or other similar taxes, assessments or charges levied by any governmental or revenue authority in respect of this Agreement or any of the Notes or any other document referred to herein.
-68- The Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Bank, each of their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them (including, without limitation, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent to any Bank, whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Bank is a party thereto) arising out of or by reason of any investigation or litigation or other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or other proceedings) relating to the Loans or any other extension of credit hereunder or any actual or proposed use by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of any of the Loans or of any Letter of Credit hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation or litigation or other proceedings (but excluding for any Person any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person or of such Person's directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents). 11.04 Amendments, Etc. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any provision of this Agreement may be modified or supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by each Borrower and the Majority Banks, or by each Borrower and the Administrative Agent acting with the consent of the Majority Banks, and any provision of this Agreement may be waived by the Majority Banks or by the Administrative Agent acting with the consent of the Majority Banks; provided that (a) no modification, supplement or waiver shall: (i) increase, or extend the term of the Commitments, or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination of the Commitments, without the consent of each Bank affected thereby, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, any reimbursement obligation in respect of an LC Disbursement or any fee hereunder, without the consent of each Bank affected thereby, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal or LC Disbursement, without the consent of each Bank affected thereby, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or any fee is payable hereunder, without the consent of each Bank affected thereby, (v) change Section 4.02 hereof in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing required thereby, without the consent of each Bank, (vi) alter the terms of Section 4.07(b) hereof or this Section 11.04, without the consent of each Bank, (vii) modify the definition of the term "Majority Banks" or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Banks required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof, without the consent of each Bank or (viii) release the Company from its guarantee obligations under Section 12 hereof without the written consent of each Bank; and (b) no modification, supplement or waiver shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the consent of the Administrative Agent. 11.05 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 11.06 Assignments and Participations. (a) No Borrower may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder or under the Notes or any other Loan Document without the prior consent of all of the Banks and the Administrative Agent.
-69- (b) Each Bank may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and Credit Exposure at the time owing to it) (but only with the consent of the Company, each Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, each of which consents will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that (i) no such consent by the Company shall be required if the assignee is a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) except to the extent the Company (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent, any such partial assignment (other than to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank) shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000; (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement; and (iv) the assignee and assignor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance an Assignment and Assumption for each such assignment. Upon execution and delivery by the assignor and the assignee to the Administrative Agent of such Assignment and Assumption, and upon consent thereto by the Company and the Administrative Agent to the extent required above, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise consented to by the Company and the Administrative Agent), the obligations, rights and benefits of a Bank hereunder holding the Commitment and Credit Exposure (or portions thereof) assigned to it and specified in such Assignment and Assumption (in addition to the Commitment and Credit Exposure, if any, theretofore held by such assignee) and the assigning Bank shall, to the extent of such assignment, be released from the Commitment (or portion thereof) so assigned. Upon each such assignment, the assignor or assignee shall pay the Administrative Agent an assignment fee of $3,500. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, and (iii) the rights of any such SPC shall be derivative of the rights of the Granting Bank, and such SPC shall be subject to all of the restrictions upon and requirements imposed upon the Granting Bank herein contained. Each SPC shall be conclusively presumed to have made arrangements with its Granting Bank for the exercise of voting and other rights hereunder in a manner which is acceptable to the SPC, the Administrative Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers, and each of the Administrative Agent, the Banks and each Borrower shall be entitled to rely upon and deal solely
-70- with the Granting Bank with respect to Loans made by or through its SPC. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of a claim against such SPC under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.06(b), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Company and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This paragraph may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC at the time holding Loans under this Agreement. (c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more other Persons (each a "Participant") a participation in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and Credit Exposure at the time owing to it), provided that such Participant shall not have any rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Note (the Participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreements executed by such Bank in favor of the Participant). All amounts payable by any Borrower to any Bank under Section 5 hereof in respect of Credit Exposure held by it, and its Commitment, shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold or agreed to sell any participations in such Credit Exposure and Commitment, and as if such Bank were funding each of such Credit Exposure and Commitment in the same way that it is funding the portion of Credit Exposure and Commitment in which no participations have been sold. In no event shall a Bank that sells a participation agree with the Participant to take or refrain from taking any action hereunder except that such Bank may agree with the Participant that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase or extend the term of such Bank's Commitment, or extend the time or waive any requirement for the reduction or termination, of such Bank's Commitment, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the related Loan or Loans or any portion of any fee hereunder payable to the Participant or any LC Disbursement or any interest thereon, (iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal or any LC Disbursement or any interest thereon, (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, or any fee hereunder payable to the Participant, to a level below the rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive such interest or fee or (v) consent to any modification, supplement or waiver hereof to the extent that the same, under Section 11.04 hereof, requires the consent of each Bank. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.01, 5.04, 5.05 and 5.07 hereof to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
-71- paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that a Participant (i) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.01, 5.05 or 5.07 hereof than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent and (ii) that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.05 hereof unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of each Borrower, to comply with Section 5.05(e) hereof as though it were a Bank. (d) In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.06, any Bank may (without notice to or consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Bank and without payment of any fee) (i) assign and pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including, without limitation, to assign or pledge to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank and (ii) assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Loans and its Notes to an Affiliate. No such assignment shall release the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder. (e) A Bank may furnish any information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.12 hereof. (f) Anything in this Section 11.06 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Bank may assign or sell a participation in any interest in any of its rights under this Agreement to the Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Bank. 11.07 Survival. The obligations of the Company under Sections 5.01, 5.04, 5.05 and 11.03 hereof, and the obligations of the Banks under Sections 10.05 and 11.12 hereof, shall survive the repayment of the extensions of credit and the termination of the Commitments and, in the case of any Bank that may assign any interest in its Commitment or extensions of credit hereunder, shall survive the making of such assignment, notwithstanding that such assigning Bank may cease to be a "Bank" hereunder. In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to be made by a notice of any extension of credit (whether by means of a Loan or Letter of Credit), herein or pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and no Bank shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any extension of credit (whether by means of a Loan or Letter of Credit), any Default that may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been false or misleading when made or deemed to be made, notwithstanding that such Bank or the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time such extension of credit was made. 11.08 Captions. The table of contents and captions and section headings appearing herein are included solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous arrangements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 6.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or in portable document format (.pdf) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 11.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. Each Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any New York state court sitting in New York City for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Borrower irrevocably agrees that any and all legal process in connection with any such action or proceeding in any such court may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Company at its address set forth in Section 11.02 hereof, such service being hereby acknowledged by the Borrowers to be effective and binding service. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law 11.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 11.12 Confidentiality. Each Bank and the Administrative Agent agrees (on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives) to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information supplied to it by any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory (including self-regulatory) authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
-73- subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 11.12, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.12 or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower; provided that (x) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Bank and the Administrative Agent agree, prior to disclosure thereof, to notify the Company of any request for disclosure of any such non-public information (A) by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an examination of such Bank or the Administrative Agent by such governmental agency) or (B) pursuant to legal process and (y) that in no event shall any Bank or the Administrative Agent be obligated to return any materials furnished by a Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of any information as provided in this Section 11.12 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 11.13 Designation of Subsidiary Borrowers. (a) Designation of Subsidiary Borrowers. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section (including paragraph (b) of this Section 11.13), the Company may, at any time or from time to time upon not less than 15 Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period which is acceptable to the Administrative Agent), request that a Subsidiary specified in such notice become a party to this Agreement as a Borrower; provided that each such designation shall be subject to the prior approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, in connection with such approval for any Foreign Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent shall, in its sole discretion, determine such additional representations and warranties to be provided by such Foreign Subsidiary in its Subsidiary Borrower Designation with respect to tax and related matters for such Foreign Subsidiary and its obligations hereunder (including with respect to stamp and similar taxes, the absence of any withholding or similar tax in respect of payments by such Foreign Subsidiary hereunder under the laws of its Relevant Jurisdiction and the absence of any notarization requirements for the validity and enforceability of the Subsidiary Borrower Loan Documents to which such Subsidiary is to be a party). The Administrative Agent shall upon receipt of such notice from the Company promptly notify each Bank of the Company's designation. Upon such approval and the satisfaction of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this Section 11.13, such Subsidiary shall become a party to this Agreement as a Borrower hereunder and shall be entitled to borrow Loans or request the issuance of Letters of Credit on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of such designation.
-74- (b) Conditions Precedent to Designation Effectiveness. The designation by the Company of any Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which the Administrative Agent shall have received each of the following documents (each of which shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in form and substance): (i) Subsidiary Borrower Designation. A Subsidiary Borrower Designation, duly completed (including, in the case of any Foreign Subsidiary, such additional representations and warranties determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the proviso in the first sentence of Section 11.13(a) hereof) and executed by the Company and the relevant Subsidiary, delivered to the Administrative Agent at least 5 Business Days before the date on which such Subsidiary is proposed to become a Subsidiary Borrower; (ii) Opinion of Counsel. If reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, a favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Banks and appropriately dated) of external or internal counsel to such Subsidiary satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in such Subsidiary's Relevant Jurisdiction (and the Company and such Subsidiary Borrower hereby and by delivery of such Subsidiary Borrower Designation instruct such counsel to deliver such opinion to the Banks and the Administrative Agent, if such opinion is so requested), as to such other matters as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (which may include the due incorporation of such Subsidiary under the laws of the Relevant Jurisdiction, the due authorization, execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of such Subsidiary Borrower Designation and of any extensions of credit to made by it hereunder, the obtaining of all licenses, approvals and consents of, and the making of all filings and registrations with, any applicable Governmental Authority required in connection therewith (or the absence of any thereof), the legality, validity and binding effect and enforceability thereof, and (in the case of a Foreign Subsidiary) the absence of any withholding or similar tax under the laws of the Relevant Jurisdiction in respect of payments by such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder); (iii) Corporate Documents. Such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (including certified copies of the organizational documents of such Subsidiary and of resolutions of its board of directors authorizing such Subsidiary becoming a Borrower hereunder, and of all documents evidencing all other necessary corporate or other action required with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower becoming party to this Agreement); and (iv) Other Documents. Receipt of such other documents relating thereto as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may reasonably request, which may include other documents that are consistent with conditions for Subsidiary Borrowers set forth in Section 4.01. (c) Termination of Subsidiary Borrowers. The Company may, at any time at which no Loans or any other amounts hereunder or under any other Loan Documents shall be outstanding to a Subsidiary Borrower that is the subject of the Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice referred to below, terminate such Subsidiary Borrower as a Borrower hereunder by
-75- delivering to the Administrative Agent an executed notice thereof (each a "Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice"), substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto. Any Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly so notify the Banks and the Issuing Banks), whereupon all commitments of the Banks to make Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower and all of the rights of such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall terminate and such Subsidiary Borrower shall immediately cease to be a Borrower hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the delivery of a Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Section 12 with respect to any such unpaid obligations. Upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 9(e), (f) or (g) hereof (or any event which under the laws of any jurisdiction is analogous to any such event) relating to a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, (i) all commitments of the Banks to make Loans to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and all of the rights of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall automatically terminate and such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall immediately cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereunder, (ii) the principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued interest on, the Loans (if any) made to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and all other amounts payable by such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and under the Notes (including, without limitation, any amounts payable under Section 5.04 hereof) shall automatically become immediately due and payable and (iii) if any Letters of Credit are then outstanding under which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is the account party, the Company shall provide cash cover in an amount equal to the LC Exposure in respect of all such Letters of Credit, as specified in the last paragraph of Section 9 hereof, in each case, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. 11.14 Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Currency"), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Place"), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the "Second Currency"), the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section 11.14 called an "Entitled Person") shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due
-76- hereunder in the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and each Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred. 11.15 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Bank hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Bank to identify each Borrower in accordance with said Act. 11.16 Waivers of Certain Notices under Existing Credit Agreements. As of the Effective Date, (a) each of the Banks signatory hereto that is also a party to the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement hereby agrees that (i) all of the commitments to extend credit under the Existing 364-Day Credit Agreement will be terminated automatically and that this Agreement constitutes notice of such termination and (ii) waives the requirement for prior notice with respect to such termination and/or any prepayment of loans (if any) thereunder as of the Effective Date; and (b) each of the Banks signatory hereto that is also a party to the Existing 5-Year Credit Agreement hereby agrees that waives the requirement for prior notice with respect to any prepayment of loans (if any) thereunder as of the Effective Date. 11.17 Appointment of Company as Agent. Each Subsidiary Borrower party hereto as of the Effective Date, by its signature below, and each Subsidiary Borrower designated after the Effective Date as a "Subsidiary Borrower" pursuant to Section 11.13 hereof, by its acknowledgment to the Subsidiary Borrower Designation relating to such Subsidiary Borrower, as applicable: (a) appoints and authorizes the Company for the purposes of (i) signing documents deliverable by or on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) providing notices to or making requests of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower, (iii) receiving notices and documents from the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower and (iv) taking any other action on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document, in each case to the extent specifically provided for hereunder or thereunder, and such Subsidiary Borrower agrees to be irrevocably bound by all such actions being taken on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower by the Company and all such notices received by the Company on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower; (b) authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Bank to treat (i) each document signed by, each notice given or received by, each document delivered or received by and each request made by the Company on its behalf and (ii) each other action which specifically provides herein or therein that the Company acts on behalf, or at the direction, of such Subsidiary Borrower as if such Subsidiary Borrower
-77- (and not the Company) had in fact signed such document, given or received such notice, delivered or received such document, made such request or taken such action to the extent such document, notice, request and other action to be signed, sent, made or taken, as applicable, specifically states that it is on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower; and (c) acknowledges that the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Bank are relying upon the appointments and authorizations set forth in this Section 11.17 in connection with the making of their Commitments and credit extensions hereunder. In the event the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank reasonably believes that it has received a conflicting notice or instruction from the Company and/or his or her designees, the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Bank may refrain from action upon such notice or instruction and shall promptly request the Company for clarification regarding such notice or instruction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless the Company shall otherwise notify the Administrative Agent thereof in writing, all notices to or requests of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank in respect on any extension of credit hereunder by any Subsidiary Borrower shall be made by the Company on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower (and not by such Subsidiary Borrower on its own behalf). Section 12. Guarantee. 12.01 Guarantee. The Company hereby guarantees to each Bank and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by optional prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) of all principal of and interest on any and all Loans made to each Subsidiary Borrower (including, without limitation, each Subsidiary Borrower that shall become party hereto after the date hereof pursuant to Section 11.13 hereof), and the prompt payment in full of all other amounts payable by each Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in each case in strict accordance with the terms thereof (all such obligations being herein collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Company hereby further agrees that if any Subsidiary Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by optional prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Company will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. 12.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Company under Section 12.01 hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the authorization, value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any agreement or instrument under which any Guaranteed Obligations have been incurred (herein, the "Underlying Instruments"), or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
-78- defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 12.02 that the obligations of the Company hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Company hereunder which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Company, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any Underlying Instrument shall be done or omitted; (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any Underlying Instrument shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; or (iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any Bank as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected. The Company hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Bank exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Subsidiary Borrower under any Underlying Instrument, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. 12.03 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Company under this Section 12 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Company agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Bank in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. 12.04 Subrogation. The Company hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all Guaranteed Obligations, and the expiration or termination of the Commitments or other obligations of the Banks to make financial accommodations available to any Subsidiary Borrower under the Underlying Instruments, it shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance by it of the guarantee in this Section 12, whether
-79- by subrogation or otherwise, against any Subsidiary Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. 12.05 Remedies. The Company agrees that, as between the Company on the one hand and the Administrative Agent and the Banks on the other, the obligations of any Subsidiary Borrower under the Underlying Instruments may be declared to be forthwith due and payable (and, in the event of the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable) for purposes of Section 12.01 hereof notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against such Subsidiary Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by such Subsidiary Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company for purposes of Section 12.01 hereof. 12.06 Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 12 is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.

ANNEX 1 COMMITMENTS Annex 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
ANNEX 2 Mandatory Costs Calculation of Mandatory Cost Rate 1. The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate the Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank. 2. On the first day of each Interest Period for any Loan denominated in Pounds Sterling or another Agreed Foreign Currency (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "Additional Cost Rate") for each Bank participating in such Loan, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of such Banks' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each such Bank in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. 3. The Additional Cost Rate for any Bank lending from a specific lending office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Bank to the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Bank in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Bank's participation in all Loans made from that lending office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that lending office. 4. The Additional Cost Rate for any Bank lending from a lending office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as follows: (a) in relation to a Loan made in Pounds Sterling: AB + C(B - D) + E x 0.01 ------------------------ percent per annum 100 - (A + C) (b) in relation to a Loan made in any Agreed Foreign Currency other than Pounds Sterling: E x 0.01 -------- percent per annum. 300 Where: A is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which such Bank is from time to time required to maintain as an Annex 2 to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
-2- interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements. B is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin and the Mandatory Cost and, if applicable, any additional amount of interest specified in Section 2.14(f)) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan. C is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which such Bank is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England. D is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits. E is designed to compensate the Banks for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per L1,000,000; 5. For the purposes of this Schedule 1.01C: (a) "Eligible Liabilities" has the meaning given to it from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England. (b) "Fees Rules" means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits. (c) "Fee Tariffs" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate). (d) "Reference Bank" means the principal London offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or such other banks as may be appointed by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Company. (e) "Special Deposits" has the meaning given to it from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England. (f) "Tariff Base" has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.
-3- 6. In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included in the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 percent will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places. 7. If requested by the Administrative Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per L1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank. 8. Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank: (a) the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office; and (b) any other information that the Agent may reasonably require for such purpose. Each Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph. 9. The percentages of each Bank for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Bank notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with an lending office in the same jurisdiction as its lending office. 10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Bank or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects. 11. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Banks on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Bank based on the information provided by each Bank and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above. 12. Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule 1.01C in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable
-4- to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to the Credit Agreement. 13. The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Company and the Banks, determine and provide notice to the Company and the Banks of any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule 1.01C in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties to the Credit Agreement.

EXHIBIT B [Form of Opinion of the Counsel for the Company] May 19, 2006 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent Ladies and Gentlemen: I have acted as counsel for Pitney Bowes Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of May 19, 2006, among the Company, the Banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, providing for extensions of credit to be made by said Banks to the Company. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined the following agreements, instruments and other documents: (a) the Credit Agreement; (b) the Notes(if any) of the Company executed and delivered on the Effective Date; and (c) such records of the Company and such other documents as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below. The Credit Agreement and such Notes are collectively referred to as the "Credit Documents". In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, I have relied upon statements of governmental officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Documents and certificates of appropriate representatives of the Company. In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have assumed, with respect to all of the documents referred to in this opinion letter, that (except, to the extent set forth in the opinions expressed below, as to the Company): Opinion of the Counsel for the Company
-2- (i) such documents have been duly authorized by, have been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties to such documents; (ii) all signatories to such documents have been duly authorized; and (iii) all of the parties to such documents are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such documents. Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. 2. The Company has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations and to borrow under, the Credit Documents. 3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of each Credit Document, and the borrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. 4. The Company has duly executed and delivered each Credit Document. 5. Each Credit Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as the enforceability of the Credit Documents is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. 6. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of the United States of America or the State of New York is required on the part of the Company for the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of any of the Credit Documents or for the borrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement. 7. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by, the Credit Documents do not and will not (a) violate any provision of its charter or by-laws, (b) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, (c) violate any order, writ, injunction,
-3- decree or award of any court or governmental authority or agency or any arbitral award applicable to the Company or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries or (d) result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the acceleration or required prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of them is subject. 8. Except as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for the Company's fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006, I have no knowledge (after due inquiry) of any legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any governmental or regulatory authority or agency, pending or threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties that would have a Material Adverse Effect. 9. The Company is not an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications: (A) The enforceability of Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct. (B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances. (C) Paragraph (iii) of Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially modified. (D) I express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Bank is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Bank may impose, (ii) Section 4.07(c) of the Credit Agreement, (iii) the second sentence of Section 11.10 of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Documents, and (iv) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 11.10 of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. (E) I wish to point out that (i) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in
-4- any Foreign Currency would be rendered in such Foreign Currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment and (ii) a judgment rendered by a United States Federal court in the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in a Foreign Currency may be expressed in Dollars (provided that I express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply). The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the law of the State of New York, and I do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. At the request of my client, this opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 6.01(d) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by me and may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, my prior written consent. Very truly yours,
EXHIBIT C [Form of Opinion of Special New York Counsel to JPMCB] May 19, 2006 To the Banks party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as special New York counsel to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMCB") in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 19, 2006 (the "Credit Agreement") among Pitney Bowes Inc. (the "Company"), each subsidiary borrower party thereto (together with the Company, the "Borrowers") the banks party thereto and JPMCB, as Administrative Agent, amending and restating the Credit Agreement dated as of May 21, 2004 (the "Existing Credit Agreement") and providing for extensions of credit to be made by said banks to the Borrowers. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein. This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(e) of the Credit Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined executed counterparts of the Credit Agreement and the Notes (if any) executed and delivered on the Effective Date (collectively referred to as the "Credit Documents"). In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon representations made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement. In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed that (i) the Credit Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and (except to the extent expressly set forth in the opinions below as to each Borrower) constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties thereto; (ii) all signatories thereto have been duly authorized; (iii) all of the parties thereto are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform the same; and. (iv) upon the delivery of this opinion, the conditions precedent in Section 6 of the Credit Agreement have been satisfied (including that all Persons specified in Section 6.01(a) of the Credit Agreement have executed and delivered the Credit Agreement or have provided a confirmation with respect thereto as contemplated thereby). Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion that each of the Credit Documents constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower party thereto, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be Opinion of Special New York Counsel to JPMCB
-2- limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally (including the possible judicial application of foreign laws or governmental action affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights) and except as the enforceability of the Credit Documents is subject to the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. The foregoing opinions are subject to the following comments and qualifications: (A) The enforceability of Section 11.03 and 12.03 of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct. (B) The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances. (C) Paragraph (iii) of Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement may not be enforceable to the extent that the Guaranteed Obligations are materially modified. (D) We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Bank is located (other than the State of New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may impose for the loan or use of money or other credit, (ii) Section 4.07(c) of the Credit Agreement, (iii) the second sentence of Section 11.10 of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Documents, (iv) the waiver of inconvenient forum set forth in Section 11.10 of the Credit Agreement with respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and (v) Section 11.14 of the Credit Agreement. (E) We wish to point out that (i) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in any Foreign Currency would be rendered in such Foreign Currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment and (ii) a judgment rendered by a United States Federal court in the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in a Foreign Currency may be expressed in Dollars (provided that we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply).
-3- The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. This opinion letter is, pursuant to Section 6.01(e) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by us in our capacity as special New York counsel to JPMCB and may not be relied upon by any other person or for any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in each instance, our prior written consent.
