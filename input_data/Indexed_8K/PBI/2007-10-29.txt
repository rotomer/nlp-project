Exhibit 99.1 Pitney Bowes Announces Third Quarter Results STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 29, 2007--Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) today reported third quarter 2007 financial results. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1.5 billion compared with the same period last year and income from continuing operations on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis was $129 million. As discussed in previous quarters, income from continuing operations reflects the alignment of MapInfo's accounting treatment for software revenue recognition with the company's policies. In addition, income from continuing operations this quarter included two non-cash adjustments: a $4 million decrease in the company's deferred taxes primarily due to recent changes in German tax laws, and a $4 million pre-tax impairment of certain intangible assets in the company's legal solutions business. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $139 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $.63 as compared with $.66 for the same period last year and below the company's guidance of $.70 to $.74. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis was $.58 as compared with $.64 for the same period last year and below the company's guidance of $.68 to $.72. The company generated $290 million in cash from operations during the quarter. Free cash flow was $239 million. The company used $72 million for dividends and $105 million to repurchase 2.3 million of its shares during the quarter. The remaining authorization for future share repurchases is $161 million. Year-to-date the company has generated $550 million in free cash flow and has returned $497 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. The company is raising its guidance for annual free cash flow for 2007 to $625 to $675 million from $550 to $625 million. This reflects lower utilization of cash for finance receivables, working capital, and capital expenditures than originally planned. Commenting on the quarter, President and CEO Murray D. Martin noted, "Business conditions during the third quarter were much more challenging than we originally anticipated. Our Software and Mail Services segments continued to have very strong results, but their performance was offset by weakness in our U.S. and International Mailing segments as well as in our Management Services segment." Mr. Martin noted that the company's performance during the quarter was negatively affected by four factors. "First, weakness in certain sectors of the economy, such as financial services, is resulting in lower sales of equipment and software as well as lower print and supplies volumes. Second, the postal rate case in the second quarter was a positive event for U.S. Mailing and helped generate significant incremental sales during that quarter. It is now apparent, however, that more of those sales were shifted from what would have normally occurred in future quarters than we had originally anticipated. Additionally, the benefit from meter migration this quarter was less than we expected. Third, in International Mailing, delays in postal liberalization across Europe are creating a more difficult environment in the postal sector and are impacting customer purchases. The EBIT margin for International Mailing was adversely impacted by both the lower revenue growth and greater than anticipated expenses associated with our outsourcing contracts for European back office operations. And finally, at Pitney Bowes Management Services, the benefit from the strong written business in prior quarters was offset by continuation of weak results in legal solutions and delays in government outsourcing contracts." Business Segment Results Mailstream Solutions includes worldwide revenue and related expenses from the sale, rental, and financing of mail finishing, mail creation, shipping, and production mail equipment; supplies; mailing and multi-vendor support services; payment solutions; and mailing and customer communication software. In the third quarter, Mailstream Solutions revenue increased 3 percent to $1.1 billion and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) declined 4 percent to $286 million, when compared with the prior year. Within Mailstream Solutions: U.S. Mailing revenue declined 3 percent to $572 million and EBIT declined 3 percent to $224 million. The segment's results for the quarter were unfavorably impacted by lower equipment sales and rentals. International Mailing revenue grew 1 percent to $254 million and EBIT decreased 24 percent to $33 million. International Mailing revenue growth benefited by about 6 percent from favorable currency translation, but was adversely affected by lower equipment sales and rentals in Europe. The company's continued investments for growth in sales and marketing channels in Europe, as well as expenses related to outsourcing the company's European back office operations, negatively impacted the segment's EBIT margin. Worldwide revenue for Production Mail grew 1 percent to $148 million and EBIT increased 21 percent to $17 million. Revenue growth was driven by broad-based equipment placements in the Asia-Pacific region and favorable currency translation, which contributed about 2 percent to growth. However, lower equipment sales in the U.S. and Europe offset this growth. The segment's EBIT margin benefited from the favorable mix of equipment sales. Software revenue increased 85 percent to $92 million and EBIT increased 50 percent to $11 million. Results for the quarter were driven by the acquisition of MapInfo, which increased revenue by about 68 percent and favorable currency translation, which contributed about 7 percent. There continues to be robust demand for the company's software solutions, particularly outside the U.S. Mailstream Services includes worldwide revenue and related expenses from facilities management contracts, reprographics, document management, and other value-added services for targeted customer markets; mail services operations, which include presort mail services and cross-border mail services; and marketing services. For the quarter, Mailstream Services reported revenue growth of 11 percent to $442 million, and EBIT increased 16 percent to $40 million, versus the prior year. Within Mailstream Services: Management Services revenue increased 6 percent to $278 million for the quarter while EBIT declined 10 percent to $17 million. The segment's revenue growth for the quarter was helped by acquisitions, which added about 2 percent to growth; favorable currency translation, which added about 2 percent to growth; and strong written business in prior quarters. Revenue, as well as EBIT margin, was adversely affected by lower pricing on contract renewals, continued weakness in legal solutions and delays in government contracts. Mail Services revenue grew 27 percent to $116 million and EBIT grew 85 percent to $17 million. Revenue growth was driven by both presort and cross-border mail services, while EBIT benefited from the ongoing successful integration of new sites and increased operating efficiencies. Additionally, the segment was positively impacted by the postal rate case enacted earlier in the year, which increased the worksharing discounts available to large mailers. Marketing Services revenue increased 12 percent to $48 million, while EBIT declined 13 percent to $5 million. The segment's results include the recent acquisition of Digital Cement, which added 15 percent to growth, and the continued expansion of marketing services programs. Lower revenue in the company's motor vehicle registration services again had an adverse effect on the segment's revenue and EBIT. Outlook The company anticipates fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6 to 9 percent and revenue growth of 6 to 8 percent for the full year. Excluding the accounting alignment for MapInfo and the non-cash adjustments, the company expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $.67 to $.71 for the fourth quarter and $2.67 to $2.71 for the full year. The company expects earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the range of $.66 to $.70 for the fourth quarter and $2.59 to $2.63 for the full year. 4Q07 4Q06 Full Year 2007 Full Year 2006 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adjusted EPS $.67 to $.71 $.77 $2.67 to $2.71 $2.69 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MapInfo Accounting ($.01) N/A ($0.05) N/A - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Restructuring N/A ($.05) N/A ($0.10) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tax Adjustments N/A N/A ($0.02) ($0.09) - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Other (Expense)/Income N/A $.01 ($0.01) $0.01 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GAAP EPS $.66 to $.70 $.73 $2.59 to $2.63 $2.51 - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The company also announced that it plans to hold a special investor call on Thursday, November 15 to discuss its action plans for the current market conditions. Management of Pitney Bowes will discuss the company's results in a broadcast over the Internet today at 5:00 p.m. EDT. Instructions for listening to the earnings results via the Web are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's web site at www.pb.com/investorrelations. Pitney Bowes engineers the flow of communication. The company is a $6 billion global leader of mailstream solutions headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. For more information about the company, its products, services and solutions, visit www.pitneybowes.com. Pitney Bowes has presented in this earnings release diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis. Also, management has included a presentation of free cash flow on an adjusted basis, adjusted income from continuing operations, and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Management believes this presentation provides a reasonable basis on which to present the adjusted financial information, and is provided to assist in investors' understanding of the company's results of operations. The company's financial results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, earnings per share, income from continuing operations, and free cash flow results are adjusted to exclude the impact of special items such as restructuring charges, accounting adjustments and write downs of assets, which materially impact the comparability of the company's results of operations. Although restructuring charges represent actual expenses to the company, these charges might mask the periodic income and financial and operating trends associated with our business. The use of free cash flow has limitations. GAAP cash flow has the advantage of including all cash available to the company after actual expenditures for all purposes. Free cash flow permits a shareholder insight into the amount of cash that management could have available for discretionary uses if it made different decisions about employing its cash. It adjusts for long-term commitments such as capital expenditures, as well as special items like cash used for restructuring charges, unusual tax payments and contributions to its pension funds. Of course, these items use cash that is not otherwise available to the company and are important expenditures. Management compensates for these limitations by using a combination of GAAP cash flow and free cash flow in doing its planning. The adjusted financial information and certain financial measures such as EBIT are intended to be more indicative of the ongoing operations and economic results of the company. EBIT excludes interest payments and taxes, both cash items, and as a result, has the effect of showing a greater amount of earnings than net income. The company uses EBIT, in addition to net income and income from continuing operations, for purposes of measuring the performance of its unit management team. The interest rates and tax rates applicable to the company generally are outside the control of management, and it can be useful to judge performance independent of those variables. The adjusted financial information should be viewed as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Further, our definition of this adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Pitney Bowes has provided in supplemental schedules attached for reference adjusted financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the differences between the adjusted financial measures with the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, except with respect to our guidance because it would not be meaningful. Additional reconciliation of adjusted financial measures to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP may be found at the company's web site www.pb.com/investorrelations in the Investor Relations section.
