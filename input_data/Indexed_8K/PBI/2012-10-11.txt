ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
At our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders did not approve our advisory resolution on our executive compensation. During 2012, the Chairman of the Executive Compensation Committee and various members of management have been in contact with stockholders to discuss their specific concerns and seek input on our executive compensation program. Following those discussions, the Executive Compensation Committee conducted a reexamination of our executive compensation, including input from a newly retained independent compensation consultant. The independent members of the Board of Directors, based on recommendations from the Executive Compensation Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, adopted the following changes that will be effective for our executive compensation program:
ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
In addition to the above-enumerated changes that are effective in 2012, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Executive Compensation Committee, approved the following additional changes to our executive compensation program:
We will continue communicating with our stockholders to gain further insight regarding their views on our
executive compensation program, and will provide additional discussion with respect to our compensation programs and practices in our proxy statement for the next annual meeting of stockholders. We wish to thank our stockholders for their time and thoughtful input for this important matter.
