On November 27, 2012, Pitney Bowes Inc. (the "Company") completed a public offering of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Notes Due 2022 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered under the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-176957), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 22, 2011.
The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2005, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 23, 2007, by and among the Company, The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the "Trustee"), and Citibank, N.A., as resigning trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), on the terms and conditions set forth in an Officers' Certificate, dated November 27, 2012 (the "Officers' Certificate"). The Indenture and the Officers' Certificate include customary agreements and covenants by the Company. These covenants include limitations on the Company's ability, with significant exceptions, (i) to incur debt secured by liens on certain property above a threshold, (ii) to engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions involving certain property above a threshold and (iii) to consolidate or merge, or sell, lease or convey the Company's assets substantially as an entirety. Upon the occurrence of both (i) a change of control of the Company and (ii) a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating by both of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services within a specified period, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, as set forth in more detail in the Prospectus Supplement.
The Notes are the Company's unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Notes will mature on November 27, 2022. Interest on the Notes will be payable on February 27, May 27, August 27 and November 27 of each year, beginning on February 27, 2013. The interest rate on the Notes is 5.25% per year. The Notes were sold to the underwriters at par.
The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the Company's option. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is prior to November 27, 2015 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those notes to the redemption date, the excess of (x) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a quarterly basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the treasury rate plus 55 basis points over (y) the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date that is on or after November 27, 2015 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed accrued and unpaid interest.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned officers, on behalf of the Company, have executed this Certificate as of the date first written above.
          THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITORY (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE) OR A NOMINEE THEREOF. THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE. EVERY SECURITY AUTHENTICATED AND DELIVERED UPON REGISTRATION OF, TRANSFER OF, OR IN EXCHANGE FOR, OR IN LIEU OF, THIS SECURITY WILL BE A GLOBAL SECURITY SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT IN SUCH LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
          UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY, TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
          Pitney Bowes Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal amount on the Stated Maturity specified above unless redeemed or repurchased prior to such date in accordance with the provisions referred to on the reverse hereof (the stated maturity or date of earlier redemption or repurchase as the case may be, is referred to herein as the "Maturity") and to pay interest thereon (computed, on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), from and including the Issue Date specified above (the "Issue Date") or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on this Security (or any predecessor Security) has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date, on the Interest Payment Dates specified above in each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date") and at Maturity, at the rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date.
          Any interest on this Security that is payable but not punctually paid or duly provided for ("defaulted interest") on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of such Holder having been a Holder on such Regular Record Date. Such defaulted interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or clause (b) below:
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed by manual or facsimile signature under its corporate seal.
          This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities") issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2005, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Initial Indenture"), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 23, 2007, by and among the Company, The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the "Trustee"; which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and Citibank, N.A., as resigning trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Initial Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially to an aggregate principal amount of $                     , which amount may be increased at the option of the Company if in the future it determines that it may wish to reopen the series of Securities of which this Security is a part and sell additional Securities having the same terms. Except as may be otherwise stated on the face hereof, the Securities of this series are issuable only as registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $25.00 and integral multiples in excess thereof.
          The Securities are general, direct, unconditional and senior unsecured obligations of the Company.
          The Company may redeem the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, at any time in whole or from time to time in part on any day fixed for redemption in accordance with this Security and the Indenture (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to (i) in the case of a Redemption Date on or after November 27, 2015, the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed and accrued but unpaid interest on those Securities to such Redemption Date; provided, however, that interest shall be payable on an Interest Payment Date that falls on or before the Redemption Date to Holders of Securities on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date or (ii) in the case of a Redemption Date prior to November 27, 2015, the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed, accrued but unpaid interest on those Securities to such Redemption Date, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any, as defined below; provided, however, that interest shall be payable on an Interest Payment Date that falls on or before the Redemption Date to Holders of Securities on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date.
          "Make-Whole Amount" means, in connection with any optional redemption, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the Redemption Date of each dollar of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest, exclusive of interest accrued to such Redemption Date, that would have been payable in respect of each such dollar if such redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a quarterly basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate, determined on the third Business Day preceding the date notice of such redemption is given, from the respective dates on which such principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption had not been
made, to such Redemption Date, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed.
          "Reinvestment Rate" means 0.55% plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the most recent Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity, rounded to the nearest month, corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the Redemption Date of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the nearest month. For the purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount shall be used. If the format or content of the Statistical Release changes in a manner that precludes determination of the Treasury yield in the above manner, then the Treasury yield shall be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as reasonably determined by the Company.
          "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which reports yields on actively traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any required determination under the Indenture, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated by the Company.
          The Company shall give written notice of any redemption of any Securities to Holders of the Securities to be redeemed at their addresses, as shown in the Security register for the Securities, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to any Redemption Date. The notice of redemption shall specify, among other items, the applicable Redemption Date, the redemption price and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed.
          If the Company chooses to redeem less than all of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee at least 60 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and the applicable Redemption Date. The Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities to be redeemed in part.
          Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, this Security (or the portion of the principal amount hereof so to be redeemed) shall, on the applicable Redemption Date, become due and payable at the redemption price herein specified above, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price) shall cease to bear interest.
          If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part to repurchase all or any part (equal to $25.00 and integral multiples in excess
thereof) of that Holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities to be repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
          Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, shall state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. In the event that such offer to purchase fails to satisfy the condition in the preceding sentence, the Company shall cause another notice meeting the aforementioned requirements to be mailed to Holders of the Securities.
          On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
          The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities, the Company shall comply with those securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities by virtue of any such conflict.
          For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions herein, the following terms will be applicable:
          "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company, any subsidiary or employee benefit plan of the Company or employee benefit plan of any subsidiary of the Company) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the Company or other Voting Stock into which the Voting Stock of the Company is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of transactions approved by the Board of Directors of the Company as part of a single plan, of 85% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company as shown on the Company's most recent audited balance sheet, to one or more Persons (other than the Company or one of the subsidiaries of the Company); or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction, no person or group (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
          "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event.
          "Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors of the Company who (1) was a member of such Board of Directors of the Company on the date the Securities were initially issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors of the Company at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
          "Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.
          "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
          "Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities or fails to make a rating of the Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the control of the Company, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
          "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention of the Company to effect a Change of Control; provided, however, that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will be deemed not to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus will not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance consisting of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
          "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
          "Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
          If so indicated on the face hereof, and in accordance with the terms specified thereon, this Security will be subject to redemption through operation of a sinking fund.
          The Holders of Securities are entitled to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture and in an officers' certificate adopted pursuant to the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness on this Security, or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
          If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal, premium and interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in
respect of the payment of the principal of and premium and interest, if any, on the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part shall terminate.
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of the majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.

THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE. EVERY SECURITY AUTHENTICATED AND DELIVERED UPON REGISTRATION OF, TRANSFER OF, OR IN EXCHANGE FOR, OR IN LIEU OF, THIS SECURITY WILL BE A GLOBAL SECURITY SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT IN SUCH LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.
          UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY, TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.

          Pitney Bowes Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal amount on the Stated Maturity specified above unless redeemed or repurchased prior to such date in accordance with the provisions referred to on the reverse hereof (the stated maturity or date of earlier redemption or repurchase as the case may be, is referred to herein as the "Maturity") and to pay interest thereon (computed, on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), from and including the Issue Date specified above (the "Issue Date") or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest on this Security (or any predecessor Security) has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date, on the Interest Payment Dates specified above in each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date") and at Maturity, at the rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date.
          Any interest on this Security that is payable but not punctually paid or duly provided for ("defaulted interest") on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of such Holder having been a Holder on such Regular Record Date. Such defaulted interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or clause (b) below:
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed by manual or facsimile signature under its corporate seal.
          This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities") issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of February 14, 2005, between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Initial Indenture"), as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 23, 2007, by and among the Company, The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the "Trustee"; which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and Citibank, N.A., as resigning trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Initial Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially to an aggregate principal amount of $                     , which amount may be increased at the option of the Company if in the future it determines that it may wish to reopen the series of Securities of which this Security is a part and sell additional Securities having the same terms. Except as may be otherwise stated on the face hereof, the Securities of this series are issuable only as registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $25.00 and integral multiples in excess thereof.
          The Securities are general, direct, unconditional and senior unsecured obligations of the Company.
          The Company may redeem the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, at any time in whole or from time to time in part on any day fixed for redemption in accordance with this Security and the Indenture (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to (i) in the case of a Redemption Date on or after November 27, 2015, the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed and accrued but unpaid interest on those Securities to such Redemption Date; provided, however, that interest shall be payable on an Interest Payment Date that falls on or before the Redemption Date to Holders of Securities on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date or (ii) in the case of a Redemption Date prior to November 27, 2015, the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed, accrued but unpaid interest on those Securities to such Redemption Date, and the Make-Whole Amount, if any, as defined below; provided, however, that interest shall be payable on an Interest Payment Date that falls on or before the Redemption Date to Holders of Securities on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date.
          "Make-Whole Amount" means, in connection with any optional redemption, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the Redemption Date of each dollar of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest, exclusive of interest accrued to such Redemption Date, that would have been payable in respect of each such dollar if such redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a quarterly basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate, determined on the third Business Day preceding the date notice of such redemption is given, from the respective dates on which such principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption had not been
made, to such Redemption Date, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Securities being redeemed.
          "Reinvestment Rate" means 0.55% plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the most recent Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity, rounded to the nearest month, corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the Redemption Date of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the nearest month. For the purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount shall be used. If the format or content of the Statistical Release changes in a manner that precludes determination of the Treasury yield in the above manner, then the Treasury yield shall be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as reasonably determined by the Company.
          "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which reports yields on actively traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any required determination under the Indenture, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated by the Company.
          The Company shall give written notice of any redemption of any Securities to Holders of the Securities to be redeemed at their addresses, as shown in the Security register for the Securities, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to any Redemption Date. The notice of redemption shall specify, among other items, the applicable Redemption Date, the redemption price and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed.
          If the Company chooses to redeem less than all of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee at least 60 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and the applicable Redemption Date. The Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities to be redeemed in part.
          Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, this Security (or the portion of the principal amount hereof so to be redeemed) shall, on the applicable Redemption Date, become due and payable at the redemption price herein specified above, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price) shall cease to bear interest.
          If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part to repurchase all or any part (equal to $25.00 and integral multiples in excess
thereof) of that Holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities to be repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
          Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, shall state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. In the event that such offer to purchase fails to satisfy the condition in the preceding sentence, the Company shall cause another notice meeting the aforementioned requirements to be mailed to Holders of the Securities.
          On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
          The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
          The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities, the Company shall comply with those securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities by virtue of any such conflict.

          "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company, any subsidiary or employee benefit plan of the Company or employee benefit plan of any subsidiary of the Company) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the Company or other Voting Stock into which the Voting Stock of the Company is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (2) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of transactions approved by the Board of Directors of the Company as part of a single plan, of 85% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company as shown on the Company's most recent audited balance sheet, to one or more Persons (other than the Company or one of the subsidiaries of the Company); or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction, no person or group (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
