FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 "PACCAR Inc reported record results for both revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2004," said Mark C. Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer.  "This is a tremendous achievement that reflects the innovative contribution of PACCAR's 18,000 employees worldwide.  Consistent emphasis on delivering the highest-quality products and services is reflected in strong results by every segment of the company," noted Pigott.  "PACCAR Financial Services, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR's global brands  DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth  contributed to the superior operating performance."

PACCAR earned $182.2 million ($1.03 per share diluted) for the first quarter 2004, which was an increase of 64 percent compared to the $110.8 million ($.63 per share diluted) earned in the first quarter of 2003.  First quarter net sales and financial services revenues were $2.50 billion versus $1.92 billion for the first quarter of last year.  The Company's 2004 first quarter after-tax return on sales (ROS) was a record 7.7 percent.
 
"PACCAR's balanced global diversification contributed to broad-based earnings growth.   The company has steadily invested in new products, facilities and information technology, throughout all phases of the business cycle, and is benefiting from those strategic investments," added Pigott.  "Recently completed capital projects include:  launching of Kenworth's new 24,000-square-foot research and development center last month; opening of PACCAR Parts two new parts distribution center expansions in Leyland, U.K., and Atlanta, Georgia, of 97,000 and 80,000 square feet, respectively; and successful commissioning of robotics for paint operations at several manufacturing facilities."
PACCAR was recognized as one of "Americas Most Admired Companies" in the Motor Vehicle segment by magazine in its March 8, 2004, issue.  PACCAR was rated first in the Motor Vehicles industry category in both use of corporate assets and long-term investment.
Fortune
 
In magazine's April 5, 2004, issue, PACCAR ranked second in shareholder return for all companies reported on the Fortune 500 list for the last 50 years.  An investment of $1,000 in PACCAR stock in 1954 would be worth $5.2 million today, assuming reinvestment of dividends.  In addition, PACCAR was named to prestigious 2003 Honor Roll List, which recognizes companies that earned straight A ratings, ranked on five-year average compound annual total returns through year-end 2003.  Companies had to be in the top 20 percent of firms evaluated for the past one, three, five and ten years to be considered for the Honor Roll designation.

Global Truck Market Update
 
"The North American heavy-duty truck industry's retail sales in 2004 could be 20 to 30 percent higher than last year," stated Tom Plimpton, president.  "The European industry truck market above 15 tonnes is forecast to be slightly better than last year."
 
"Truck fleets select PACCAR products due to their industry-leading life-cycle cost, reliability and outstanding resale value.  Recently, Swift Transportation Co. ordered 3,000 Kenworth trucks for their growing fleet," added Plimpton.
Financial Services Earns Record Profit
 
PACCAR's Financial Services segment represents a portfolio of more than 116,000 trucks and trailers, with total assets of $5.67 billion.  Included in this segment is PACCAR Leasing, a major full-service truck leasing company in North America, with a portfolio of more than 17,000 vehicles.
 
First quarter revenues were $127.0 million compared to $113.6 million in the same quarter of 2003.  Record pretax income of $37.5 million increased 40 percent versus the $26.7 million earned in the first quarter of 2003 due to higher asset levels, increased business volume and lower credit losses.
