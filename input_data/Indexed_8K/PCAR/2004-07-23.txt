"PACCAR has reinforced its position as a leading growth company in the financial services and capital goods sectors with an impressive record of 65 consecutive years of earnings, extraordinary product quality leadership and innovative customer care initiatives," said Pigott.

PACCAR is committed to being a leader in design, logistics, technology applications, financial services, manufacturing and aftermarket parts distribution."

Global Truck Market Update
"During the first six months of 2004, industry retail sales of Class 8 trucks in North America totaled over 110,000 units, 40 percent higher than a year ago," noted Tom Plimpton, president.  "An 8 percent increase in industry freight tonnage, improved carrier profitability, low interest rates and equipment replacement cycles are driving industry sales.  Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks' superior quality, reliability and resale value have contributed to the excellent operating performance of PACCAR's customers throughout the business cycle.   Kenworth and Peterbilt's combined Class 8 market share is over 23 percent and their Class 6-7 market share is nearly 9 percent.  Kenworth and Peterbilt have earned the highest customer satisfaction awards in all four segments of the most recent J.D. Power and Associates Heavy-Duty Truck Customer Satisfaction Study*."
"Industry truck sales in Europe above 15-tonne should be 5-10 percent higher this year than 2003 levels," added Plimpton.  "DAF is the product quality and resale value leader in Europe and has increased its market share to nearly 13 percent.  DAF's long-term market share target is to earn a 20 percent share, which is comparable to PACCAR's Class 8 results in North America," Plimpton noted.  "In the 6- to 15-tonne market, DAF has improved its market share to over 9 percent.  An important contributor to DAF's growth has been its focus on independent, entrepreneurial dealers who are investing in the expansion of their individual markets."

"Higher earning assets, improved finance margins and lower credit losses are driving the year-over-year income improvements."

PACCAR Financial Europe (PFE) is establishing operations in Portugal, Ireland, Sweden and Austria, bringing to 11 the number of countries in Western Europe served by PFE," added Tembreull.
