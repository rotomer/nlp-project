FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 "PACCAR Inc reported record revenues and net income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004," said Mark C. Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Solid GDP growth in North America and a robust commercial vehicle replacement market, complemented by PACCAR's balanced global diversification, contributed to PACCAR's excellent earnings."
October 21, 2004, Bellevue, Washington
 
PACCAR earned $246.7 million ($1.41 per diluted share) for the third quarter 2004, which was an increase of 86 percent compared to the $132.5 million ($.75 per diluted share) earned in the third quarter last year.  Third quarter net sales and financial services revenues were $2.92 billion, 42 percent higher than the $2.06 billion reported for the comparable period in 2003.  The company's 2004 third quarter after-tax return on sales (ROS) was 8.9 percent.
 
Net sales and financial services revenues for the first nine months of 2004 were $8.21 billion compared to $5.99 billion last year.  For the first nine months of 2004, PACCAR reported net income of $665.4 million ($3.78 per diluted share) compared to $367.4 million ($2.09 per diluted share) in 2003.  For the first nine months of 2004, annualized after-tax return on beginning equity was 27 percent.
 
"Everyone at PACCAR is pleased that the company achieved the best quarter in its 99-year history and exceeded its previous annual net income record ($584 million in 1999) in the first nine months of this year," noted Pigott.  "The consistent, strong financial earnings are a result of the company's passion for quality excellence, superior product performance and disciplined cost control."
 
"PACCAR has established its position as a leading growth company through its innovative implementation of integrated technology.  PACCAR continues to benchmark excellent companies such as Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Dell and Toyota," said Pigott.  "To further enhance the company's competitive position, PACCAR is increasing its substantial technology investment in all facets of the business including product development, customer sales, supply chain management, manufacturing, finance, leasing and aftermarket support programs."
 
Strengthening the Logistics Chain
"The launch of PACCAR's new state-of-the-art purchasing system, which electronically links engineering, purchasing and suppliers, generates a cohesive information loop and provides real-time data availability.  PACCAR has had excellent partnerships with its suppliers throughout its history.  This investment is another positive development that will strengthen our suppliers," said Tom Plimpton, president.  "The benefits of this investment partially offset the negative impact of increasing material costs due to higher commodity prices.  A few suppliers are still reluctant to invest in additional capacity and labor due to the cyclicality of the market, resulting in some restricted parts availability."
 
Capital Expenditures Surge Worldwide
PACCAR's excellent earnings, cash flow and strong balance sheet enable the company to continually reinvest in its manufacturing, parts distribution, financial services and information technology businesses.  PACCAR has invested over $1 billion during the past ten years to become an information technology leader  including nearly $150 million on capital projects.  Investments and actions by PACCAR during 2004 include:
 
At the recent International Automotive show in Hanover, Germany, DAF unveiled the new PACCAR MX 12.9-liter engine for use in its XF and CF products.  The MX engine sets new standards for fuel economy, power and torque, and meets Euro 4 and Euro 5 emission regulations.
 - 
                 
Since the adoption of the Block Exemption regulation in Europe in 2002, DAF has benefited as competitor dealers are eager to represent DAF due to PACCAR's business philosophy of distributing through entrepreneurial, independently-owned dealers, rather than company-owned stores.  Since the beginning of the year, 62 dealer locations have been added to PACCAR's global network of over 1,800 locations.

U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck sales could increase to 270,000-280,000 units in 2005 due to a good economy and fleet growth."
 
"The U.S. and Canada Kenworth and Peterbilt combined Class 8 retail sales market share is over 24 percent and their Class 6-7 market share is 9 percent," Plimpton added.
 
"In Western Europe, 15+ tonne truck sales of 230,000-240,000 units in 2004 are approximately ten percent higher than 2003.  In 2005, the market could be approximately 240,000-250,000.  DAF's heavy-duty market share has increased to a record level of nearly 13 percent.  In the medium-duty market, DAF's market share is 8.5 percent.  DAF's long-term market share target is to earn a 20 percent share in both the European heavy- and medium-duty segments," noted Mike Tembreull, vice chairman.

AA- credit rating to obtain competitive financing for its customers.  For both the three- and nine-month periods ending September 2004, higher earning assets, improved finance margins and lower credit losses have led to increased income.  This was the ninth consecutive quarter of record profits for PACCAR's financial services companies."
 
"The PacLease network in North America has expanded by 12 percent this year to over 200 authorized locations," noted Ken Gangl, vice president.
