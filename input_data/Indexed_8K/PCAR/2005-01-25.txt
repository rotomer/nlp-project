TERMINATION OF OPTION
 
Except as otherwise stated herein, the option granted hereunder may be exercised until the earliest to occur of the following dates to the extent so specified:
 
In the event the Optionee's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the option to the extent not yet exercised shall be immediately terminated and forfeited.

(b)

Stock options which are not exercisable on the date of such termination will be forfeited.
 
In the event the Optionee's employment is terminated before age 65 by reason of retirement on or after the date that the Optionee becomes eligible for an Early Retirement Pension under the terms of a Company sponsored retirement plan, the option to the extent not yet exercised may be exercised for a period of twelve months after the date of such early retirement, but only to the extent that the option is otherwise exercisable under the Plan on the date of such termination.

LEGALITY OF INITIAL ISSUANCE

It and the Optionee have taken any actions required to register the Common Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or to perfect an exemption from the registration requirements thereof;
(a)

NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF SHARES
 
.  Regardless of whether the offering and sale of Common Shares under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act or have been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose restrictions upon the sale, pledge or other transfer of such Common Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates) if, in the judgment of the Company and its counsel, such restrictions are necessary or desirable in order to achieve compliance with the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state or any other law or with restrictions imposed by the Company's underwriters.
(a)
                                 
Restrictions
 
.  In the event that the sale of Common Shares under the Plan is not registered under the Securities Act but an exemption is available which requires an investment representation or other representation, the Optionee shall represent and agree at the time of exercise that the Common Shares being acquired upon exercising this option are being acquired for investment, and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof, and shall make such other representations as are deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company and its counsel.
(b)
                                
Investment Intent at Exercise
 
.  In the event that certificates evidencing Common Shares are acquired under this Agreement in an unregistered transaction, they shall bear the following restrictive legend (and such other restrictive legends as are required or deemed advisable under the provisions of any applicable law):
(c)
                                 
Legend
 
"THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER SUCH ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL, THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED."
 
.  If, in the opinion of the Company and its counsel, any legend placed on a stock certificate representing Common Shares sold under this Agreement is no longer required, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to exchange such certificate for a certificate representing the same number of Common Shares but lacking such legend.
(d)
                                
Removal of Legends
.  Any determination by the Company and its counsel in connection with any of the matters set forth in this Section 9 shall be conclusive and binding on the Optionee and all other persons.

SHARES AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
.  In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Common Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in Common Shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than Common Shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of Common Shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of Common Shares, a recapitalization, a spinoff or a similar occurrence, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in one or both of (i) the number of Common Shares covered by this option or (ii) the Exercise Price.

General
 
.  In the event that the Company is a party to a merger or other reorganization, this option shall be subject to the agreement of merger or reorganization.  Such agreement may provide, without limitation, for (i) the assumption of this option by the surviving corporation or its parent, (ii) its continuation by the Company, if the Company is a surviving corporation, (iii) the acceleration of its exercisability or (iv) payment of a cash settlement equal to the difference between the amount to be paid for one Common Share under such agreement and the Exercise Price.
(b)
                                
Reorganizations
 
.  Except as provided in this Section 10, the Optionee shall have no rights by reason of (i) any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, (ii) the payment of any dividend or (iii) any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class.  Any issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or Exercise Price of the Common Shares subject to this option.  The grant of this option shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.

Rights as a Stockholder
to this option until such Common Shares have been issued in the name of the Optionee or the Optionee's representative.
