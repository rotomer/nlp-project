 "PACCAR Inc reported record revenues and net income for 2004," said Mark C. Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer.  "This result reflects the innovative contribution and dedication of PACCAR's 20,500 employees worldwide.  As PACCAR enters its 100 year, the company is building on its impressive record of 66 consecutive years of net profitability and reinforcing its outstanding reputation as one of the leading global technology companies.  All of PACCAR's truck brands  Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF  achieved record market shares, which, combined with the positive impact of earnings diversification and a robust commercial vehicle market, contributed to the company's superior operating performance."

PACCAR earned $241.4 million ($1.38 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2004, which was an increase of 52 percent compared to the $159.1 million ($0.90 per diluted share) earned in the fourth quarter of 2003.  Fourth quarter net sales and financial services revenues were $3.19 billion, 44 percent higher than the $2.21 billion reported for the comparable period in 2003.  Included in fourth quarter net income was a $23.3 million after-tax charge ($.13 per diluted share) reflecting the successful termination of the Leyland parts distribution contract with the RAC plc in the U.K.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, PACCAR will distribute DAF and Leyland parts in the U.K., which is expected to generate additional parts sales and margins.  The company's 2004 fourth quarter after-tax return on sales (ROS) was 8.0 percent.
 
Consolidated net sales and financial services revenues for 2004 were a record $11.40 billion, an increase of 39 percent from $8.19 billion in 2003.  Yearly net income in 2004 of $906.8 million ($5.16 per diluted share) increased 72 percent over 2003 earnings of $526.5 million ($2.99 per diluted share).  Dividends of $2.75 per share were declared during 2004, including a special dividend of $2.00.
"PACCAR had the best year in its history, exceeding its previous annual net income record ($584 million in 1999)," noted Mark Pigott.  "The consistent, strong earnings growth is a result of the company's passion for quality excellence, superior product performance and disciplined cost control.  PACCAR continues to benchmark excellent companies such as Microsoft, Dell, Toyota and Illinois Tool Works.  PACCAR's profitability has enabled it to systemically increase its technology investment in all facets of the business, including product design and development, customer sales, supply chain management, manufacturing and assembly, finance, leasing and aftermarket support programs.  These investments have kept PACCAR well ahead of the competition."
 
PACCAR's return on beginning shareholder equity (ROE) was 27.9 percent in 2004 compared with 20.2 percent in 2003.  The company's 2004 after-tax return on sales (ROS) was 8.4 percent versus 6.8 percent a year earlier. The excellent return on sales percent is a record for the company.  PACCAR's total shareholder return, which was 47 percent in 2004, again exceeded the Standard & Poor's 500 Index for the previous one-, five- and ten-year time periods.
 
Power Train Development Investment
 
"The commissioning of PACCAR's $16 million state-of-the-art engine development and test center is proceeding smoothly," commented Jim Cardillo, senior vice president.  "PACCAR's exciting new MX engine, for use in DAF's XF and CF vehicles, is a beneficiary of the increased investment.  In addition, the test center will enable PACCAR to better coordinate the activities of independent engine, transmission and after-treatment suppliers to meet the 2007 and 2010 emission standards.  PACCAR is a leader in seamlessly integrating complex new engine technologies with sophisticated air management and emission systems."
