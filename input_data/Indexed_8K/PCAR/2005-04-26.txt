Global Truck Market Update
 
"The commercial vehicle business is a growth industry and the North American truck market continues to benefit from strong demand," stated Tom Plimpton, president.  "PACCAR was the most profitable commercial vehicle and financial services company globally in 2004.  An element of the success is due to the many excellent long-term supplier partnerships forged over decades, which encourages collaboration on new technologies, manufacturing methods and leading-edge logistic systems, all of which benefit our customers," said Plimpton.  "Freight levels are at historically high levels and trucking company profits are up 40 percent year-over-year.  U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales are projected to be 270,000-280,000 units this year, an increase of 15 percent over 2004 levels.  The industry Class 6-7 truck market in the U.S. and Canada is expected to improve slightly compared to last year."
 
"The Western European truck market has grown faster than Euro-zone GDP due to ongoing vehicle replacement cycles and increased trade with Eastern Europe," commented Aad Goudriaan, DAF Trucks president.  "For 2005, Western European truck deliveries above 15+ tonne are forecast to be approximately 240,000-250,000 vehicles, about five percent higher than last year.  DAF Trucks has increased its market share in each of the past five years, with 2004 share at 12.8 percent, and over 14 percent in early 2005."
 
Financial Services Achieves Eleventh Consecutive Quarterly Earnings Record
 
PACCAR's financial services segment is comprised of a portfolio of over 131,000 trucks and trailers, with total assets in excess of $7.2 billion.  Included in this segment is PACCAR Leasing, a major full-service truck leasing company in North America, with a portfolio of more than 20,000 vehicles.
 
Record quarterly pretax income of $47.3 million increased 26 percent versus the $37.5 million earned in the first quarter of 2004 due to higher asset levels and margins and continued low credit losses.  First quarter revenues of $171.4 million jumped 35 percent compared to $127.0 million in the same quarter of 2004.
 
"PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) companies offer a comprehensive portfolio of finance, lease and insurance products on three continents and in 15 countries," noted Mike Tembreull, vice chairman.  "PACCAR competes in the market by focusing on transportation finance, leasing and insurance packages for customers of PACCAR's premium products.  PACCAR's superior AA- credit rating enables our finance and leasing companies to secure competitive financing for its customers."
 
Ken Gangl, vice president, noted, "PACCAR Financial Europe (PFE) is steadily increasing its asset and revenue base as more DAF dealers and customers use PFE services.  PacLease in North America is also generating excellent results as it is the primary leasing company in the market to specify Kenworth and Peterbilt products for its customers."
PACCAR Winch, one of the largest industrial winch manufacturers in the world, had higher earnings compared to the first quarter last year.
