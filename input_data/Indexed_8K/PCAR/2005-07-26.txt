Global Truck Market Update
"Industry truck sales in Europe above 15-tonnes could be slightly higher this year compared to sales during 2004," said Mike Tembreull, vice chairman.  "DAF has become the commercial vehicle product quality and resale value leader in Europe and has increased its year-to-date market share to 13.9 percent  a full percentage point over its record level in 2004.  DAF's long-term goal is to achieve over 20 percent market share, which is comparable to PACCAR's Class 8 results in North America," Tembreull noted.  To further improve its outstanding European distribution network, DAF Trucks recently began construction of a world-class, full-service dealership in Frankfurt, Germany.  Since 1996, DAF has more than doubled its market share in Germany, which is Europe's largest truck market.
 
"Through June 2005, industry retail sales of Class 8 trucks in the U.S. and Canada exceeded 137,000 units, more than 33 percent higher than a year ago," explained Tom Plimpton, president.  "Record freight tonnage, carriers achieving excellent profitability and normal equipment replacement cycles are driving industry sales.  Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks' superior quality, reliability and resale value have contributed to the excellent operating performance of PACCAR's customers," added Plimpton.
During the second quarter, Kenworth and Peterbilt began offering their 2006 models featuring new luxury truck interiors including multiplexed electronic instrumentation.   Peterbilt Motors recently launched the fuel-efficient Model 386, which features a dramatically sloped hood, integrated headlamps and a detachable sleeper.

Record quarterly pretax income of $49.9 million increased 21 percent from $41.3 million in the second quarter last year.  Second quarter revenues jumped 37 percent to $182.5 million compared to $133.4 million in the same quarter of 2004.  For the six-month period, revenues increased to $353.9 million from $260.4 million for the same period a year ago.  First-half pretax income was a record $97.2 million compared to $78.8 million in 2004.
 
"PACCAR Financial Services profitably supports the sale of PACCAR trucks throughout North America, Europe and Australia with a comprehensive portfolio of finance, lease and insurance products," said Ken Gangl, senior vice president.  "Higher earning assets, improved finance margins and sophisticated credit analysis technology are contributing to record net income."
 
"PACCAR Leasing continues to expand its business, as a record number of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks are operating in the PacLease network in North America.  PACCAR Financial Europe (PFE) has expanded its presence in Portugal, Ireland, Sweden and Austria, bringing to 11 the number of countries in Western Europe served by PFE," added Gangl.
