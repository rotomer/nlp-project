Global Truck Market Update
Industry truck sales in Western Europe above 15 tonnes are expected to be a record 255,000 units this year, a 7 percent increase from 2004 results.  Preliminary estimates for Western Europe industry truck sales above 15 tonnes in 2006 are 245,000-265,000.  "DAF has increased market share due to its high-quality vehicles, comprehensive aftermarket programs and an expanding independent dealer network," said Aad Goudriaan, DAF Trucks president.  "DAF's year-to-date heavy-duty market share is 13.6 percent  significantly higher than its record level of 12.8 percent in 2004.  DAF's long-term goal is to achieve over 20 percent market share, which is comparable to PACCAR's Class 8 results in North America."
 
To expand its already extensive product line, DAF recently introduced the new XF105 model powered by the new 12.9 litre PACCAR MX engine, available in both Euro 4 and Euro 5 specifications.  Production of the DAF XF105 will commence in the first quarter of 2006 and sets the standard for quality, efficiency, comfort and drivability.
 
In the U.S. and Canada, industry Class 8 retail sales for 2005 are expected to be about 290,000 units, nearly 25 percent higher than a year ago.  For 2006, industry sales could be 290,000-310,000 units as customers continue to update their fleets and satisfy the needs of a growing economy.  "Healthy freight volumes, strong carrier profitability and equipment
replacement cycles are driving higher industry sales," explained Tom Plimpton, president.  "Kenworth and Peterbilt truck deliveries have increased in all customer segments including for-hire carriers, private fleets, vocational customers and leasing companies."
 
PACCAR continues to be recognized as the highest-quality manufacturer in the industry.  Kenworth Truck Company earned three J.D. Power awards in 2005 by achieving the highest ranking in customer satisfaction among Class 8 truck owners in the Over the Road, Pickup and Delivery, and Dealer Service segments according to the recently released J.D. Power and Associates Heavy-Duty Truck Customer Satisfaction Study

2007 Engine Emission Outlook
PACCAR, in tandem with its major engine suppliers Cummins and Caterpillar, is actively testing engine and aftertreatment systems to meet more stringent federal emissions regulations in effect January 2007.  "This is another step in the regular engine development cycle that the industry addresses every few years," said Tom Plimpton.  "There will be cost increases due to the advanced engineering solutions, but that cost is typically passed along the logistics chain.  General economic growth should normalize industry sales during the 2005-2007 ordering cycle."
