(c) Exhibits.
 
The following is furnished as an Exhibit to this Report.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
January 31, 2006, Bellevue, Washington
 "PACCAR Inc reported record revenues and net income for 2005 as well as earning its highest quarterly profit in its 100-year history," said Mark C. Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer.  "These outstanding results are especially noteworthy as the company celebrated its Centennial anniversary in 2005.  PACCAR has achieved 67 consecutive years of net profitability and has enhanced its distinguished reputation as one of the leading global technology companies.  The strength of the company is a direct reflection of the unparalleled innovation and dedication of our 21,900 employees worldwide."
 
PACCAR earned a record $312.9 million ($1.83 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter 2005, which was an increase of 30 percent compared to the $241.4 million ($1.38 per diluted share) earned in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Fourth quarter net sales and financial service revenues were a quarterly record of $3.64 billion, 14 percent higher than the $3.19 billion reported for the comparable period in 2004.  The company's 2005 fourth quarter after-tax return on revenue (ROR) was 8.6 percent  equaling the record established in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Consolidated net sales and financial service revenues for full-year 2005 were a record $14.06 billion, an increase of 23 percent from $11.40 billion in 2004. Yearly net income in 2005 of $1.13 billion ($6.56 per diluted share) increased 25 percent over 2004 earnings of $906.8 million ($5.16 per diluted share).  Included in PACCAR's 2005 net income is a one-time charge of $64 million ($.37 per diluted share) for income taxes associated with the repatriation of $1.5 billion from its subsidiaries outside the United States.  Dividends of $2.87 per share were declared during 2005, including a special dividend of $2.00.  PACCAR's dividend yield of 3.9 percent places it in the top 50 companies in the S&P 500.
 
"PACCAR's balanced global diversification, world-class information technology, growing financial service companies and superior quality products have generated excellent financial returns," noted Pigott.  "PACCAR continues to benchmark and enhance its core competencies
based on the strong results generated by excellent companies such as Microsoft, Dell, Toyota, Illinois Tool Works and Wells Fargo.  PACCAR's profitability has enabled it to systematically increase its technology investment in all facets of the business, including product design and development, customer sales, supply chain management, manufacturing and assembly, finance, leasing and aftermarket support programs.  These investments have kept PACCAR well ahead of the competition and have highlighted PACCAR as a strong growth company in several industry segments:  capital goods, financial services and logistics.  The company's 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenues is 11 percent and profit is 16 percent, significantly higher than the company's peer group and the S&P 500."
 
PACCAR's return on beginning shareholder equity (ROE) was 30.1 percent in 2005 compared with 27.9 percent in 2004.  Total shareholder return has exceeded the Standard & Poor's 500 Index for the previous three-, five- and ten-year time periods, averaging 27.1 percent per year for the last 10 years. PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941 and dividends per share have increased 345 percent over the last four years.  PACCAR's excellent credit rating of AA- from Standard & Poor's gives PACCAR Financial a competitive advantage by lowering borrowing costs in the capital markets.
 
Information Technology Productivity Initiatives
 
PACCAR has steadily increased its investment in its Information Technology Division (ITD) to further enhance the electronic synergies between the company's financial services, aftermarket customer support, engineering and manufacturing operations.  Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF vehicles introduced new advanced vehicle electronics and networked dashboard instrumentation.  "The vehicle multiplex electrical architecture creates a flexible, integrated platform to develop an extensive range of exciting technology solutions for PACCAR customers," noted Janice Skredsvig, chief information officer.  Specific information technology initiatives include telematic solutions utilizing global positioning, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections to interface with mobile computing platforms such as tablet PCs.
 
PACCAR ITD contributed to the launch of the company's synchronized lean manufacturing platform, which delivers real-time feedback, worldwide, to its manufacturing and distribution facilities.  Skredsvig added, "In 2005 ITD provided breakthrough advancements in paint robotics software and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), updated the Electronic Dealership and installed over 3,600 new personal computers."  In addition, PACCAR's Information Technology Division developed software programs to assist customers and dealers in the management of their aftermarket parts replenishment and material logistics solutions.

Manufacturing Efficiency and Capital Investment Sets New Benchmark
 
PACCAR's steady capital investment in its global manufacturing facilities has delivered annual productivity improvements of 5-7 percent and industry-leading product quality.  Jim Cardillo, senior vice president, commented, "PACCAR is increasing its capital expenditures in 2006 and will concentrate investment in three primary business segments:  powertrain development, new product introductions and customer service.  Delivering the highest-quality products in the marketplace and also enhancing PACCAR's leadership as the low-cost manufacturer is a real benefit to our customers."  PACCAR recently installed a sophisticated robotic chassis paint system at Leyland (U.K.) which operates on a moving assembly line  a first for the automotive industry.  All PACCAR facilities extensively use Six Sigma tools, automated manufacturing and electronic diagnostic platforms to enhance real-time feedback worldwide. PACCAR invested over $100 million in a new DAF engine factory and is completing a $70 million investment to build an expanded Kenworth truck factory in Mexico.
 
Helene Mawyer, vice president, added, "PACCAR has established a goal of 50 ppm for supplier parts quality  the most demanding in the industry.  In order to assist suppliers in delivering world-class quality, PACCAR has increased its investment in suppliers' production capability, which enables them to improve their product quality and cost structure."  PACCAR has 850 supplier partners worldwide.
Global Market Update
 
During 2005, industry truck sales in Western Europe above 15 tonnes were a record 259,000 units, a 9 percent increase from 2004 results.  Industry truck sales in Western Europe above 15 tonnes in 2006 are expected to remain strong at 245,000-265,000.  "DAF has increased profit and market share for six straight years due to its high-quality vehicles, comprehensive aftermarket programs, customized financing solutions from PACCAR Financial Europe and an expanding independent dealer network," said Aad Goudriaan, DAF Trucks president.  "DAF's heavy-duty market share in 2005 was 13.7 percent versus its previous record of 12.8 percent in 2004.  DAF's long-term goal is to achieve over 20 percent market share, which is comparable to PACCAR's Class 8 results in North America."
 
"Truck market expansion in North America has been driven by a strong general economy, increased freight volume and continued fleet growth.  Many trucking companies had record profitability in 2005 as ton-miles increased due to the strong economy," noted Tom Plimpton, president.  "In the U.S. and Canada, Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved a healthy 23.1 percent Class 8 retail market share in 2005.  U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales could be 290,000-310,000 units in 2006, compared to sales of 287,500 during 2005, as customers continue to update and expand their fleets to satisfy the demands of a growing economy."

Fourth quarter pretax income of $55.5 million was a record and increased 22 percent from $45.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.

"PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) profitably supports the sale of PACCAR vehicles in 15 countries with an extensive array of finance, lease and insurance products," said Ken Gangl, senior vice president.  "A growing asset base, strong finance margins and low credit losses have contributed to outstanding profitability."
"PACCAR Financial Europe (PFE) assets grew to $1.85 billion in 2005 up 14 percent from 1.62 billion in 2004 as DAF dealers and their customers have established PFE as the leading European commercial vehicle finance company focusing on DAF's premium equipment," added Gangl.  "The PacLease network continued to expand into key locations in 2005 in order to capitalize on market opportunities.  PacLease achieved its 12th consecutive year of record profits and delivered over 5,700 Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks during the year, as customers realize the benefits of high-quality PACCAR vehicles and PacLease's operating benefits."
