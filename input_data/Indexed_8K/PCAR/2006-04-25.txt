Capital Investment Increases Companywide
"PACCAR is earning record income due to the benefits of ongoing capital investments throughout the company," said Tom Plimpton, president. "In order to further enhance its industry leadership, PACCAR will increase capital and expense investment by constructing new facilities, accelerating product development, and growing financial services and technology platforms. Examples of these investments are a new engine test center in Europe, 20 percent increase in Kenworth manufacturing capacity, new parts distribution centers, new aerodynamic and hybrid vehicles, PACCAR Leasing expansion, and new finance and manufacturing information systems. The cost of these exciting projects will increase research and development expenses, but will position the company for even stronger growth in the future."
Strong Growth of Global Commercial Vehicle Markets
"The global commercial vehicle industry is a growth business which continues to benefit from strong demand," stated Jim Cardillo, senior vice president. "Freight activity is robust and trucking company profits are at record levels," added Cardillo. "U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales are projected to be 290,000-310,000 units during 2006, an increase of approximately 5 percent over 2005 levels. The Class 6-7 industry truck market in the U.S. and Canada for 2006 is expected to increase slightly to 100,000-110,000 units."
 
"Over the last several years, the Western European truck market has increased faster than Euro-zone GDP due to a growing transport sector and an expanding European economic trading block," commented Aad Goudriaan, DAF Trucks president. "For 2006, Western European industry truck deliveries above 15 tonnes are forecast to be 245,000-265,000 vehicles, approximately equal to last year. DAF Trucks has increased its market share in each of the past six years, with an above 15 tonne market share at a record 13.7 percent in 2005. The industry 6-15 tonne truck market in 2006 should be approximately 75,000-80,000 units."

Quarterly pretax income of $54.8 million increased 16 percent versus $47.3 million earned in the first quarter of 2005 due to higher asset levels and margins and continued low credit losses. First quarter revenues of $212.5 million increased 24 percent compared to $171.4 million in the same quarter of 2005.
 
"PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) companies offer an extensive product line-up including finance, lease and insurance products in 15 countries located on three continents," noted Ken Gangl, senior vice president. "PACCAR delivers superior customer service by focusing on transportation finance, leasing and insurance packages for buyers of premium DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt products. The company's excellent AA- credit rating allows PACCAR's finance and leasing companies to offer competitive financing for its customers."
"As a growing part of the PFS group of companies, PACCAR Leasing (PacLease) is generating excellent results as the primary leasing company in the markets which specify Kenworth and Peterbilt products," added Bob Southern, PacLease president. "The PacLease network has grown to 247 franchised and company-owned locations in Canada, the United States and Mexico."
