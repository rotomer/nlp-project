Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On January 31, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PACCAR Inc approved performance-based restricted stock awards to its named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Each grant of restricted stock is evidenced by a restricted stock agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The Committee also amended Sections 7(c), 8(b) and 21 of the 2006 Restricted Stock Award Agreement. The form of Amended 2006 Restricted Stock Award Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.2. Amended Section 7(c) states that all restricted shares vest on retirement, death or disability. Amended Section 8(b) states that the Committee's determination of the reason for an executive's departure is final. Amended Section 21 provides that share adjustments shall be made to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.
The Committee also determined that, effective with the Company's August 10, 2006 stock dividend, all changes to the number or value of the Company's common shares because of a stock dividend, merger or other event as stated in Article 10 of the Long Term Incentive Plan will result in proportional adjustments to the number of shares available for a share match under the Long Term Incentive Plan's restricted stock share match program to prevent the dilution or enlargement of rights. A corresponding amendment to Section 21 of the form Share Match Restricted Stock Award Agreement was approved and an Amended Share Match Restricted Stock Award Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.3.
