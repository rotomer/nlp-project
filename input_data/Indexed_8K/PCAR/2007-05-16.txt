MISCELLANEOUS
13.01
                    
Time is of the Essence
The Inducers acknowledge that a delay in the completion of the Project will cost the Company substantial amounts of money and, therefore, time is of the essence as to all terms and conditions of this MOU; provided however, that the Parties hereto acknowledge that a delay by the Company of the satisfaction of its obligations hereunder could result in the inability of the Inducers to provide the benefits set forth in this MOU, and, therefore, the Inducers shall not be held accountable for any delay in their performance caused by a delay by the Company in the performance of its obligations hereunder.  It is the intent of the Parties that the construction portion of the Project will proceed expeditiously, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and the State.  All Parties agree that they will use best efforts in their attempt to have the Project proceed on that schedule.  The Inducers will use their best efforts to resolve any matter, not the fault of the Company, which threatens to delay the Project.  The Inducers will proceed to undertake all work with a sense of urgency and will use best efforts to accommodate the Company's schedule.  Likewise, the Company will deliver required technical information to the Inducers in a timely fashion so as not to delay the progress of the Project.  Further, the provisions of this Section 13.01 are subject to the excuse by any Party by event of
30
Force Majeure, which shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events that results in the impossibility of performance: acts of God, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and war.

Supplemental Agreements
The Inducers and the Company acknowledge and agree that supplemental agreements will, from time to time, be appropriate and advantageous in order to ensure a smooth accommodation of development on the scale and time horizon expected for the Project.  Recognizing that the commitments of this MOU are broad statements of intent that do not
31
address specific inducements and commitments in detail, the Parties also agree to negotiate in good faith to provide such other commitments and undertakings as may be reasonably required to ensure that the intent and purposes of this MOU are realized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 11, 2007, Bellevue, Washington
 In January 2007, PACCAR Inc announced plans to build a $400 million engine facility and technology center in the Southeast United States.  The new facility will be constructed in Columbus, Mississippi.  "PACCAR is pleased to locate its engine facility in one of the most dynamic and progressive areas in the Southeast," commented Mark Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer.  "The Columbus, Mississippi site provides superb proximity to our dealers, customers and strategic supplier partners.  PACCAR's outstanding financial performance, intense focus on quality, technology and productivity has enabled the company to consistently invest in its products, services and processes during all phases of the business cycle," said Pigott.  PACCAR earned record net income of $1.5 billion on revenues of $16.5 billion in 2006.
Construction on the 400,000-square-foot facility will begin in mid-2007 and is due to be completed in 2009.  The new facility will manufacture 12.9-liter and 9.2-liter diesel engines for Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF vehicles and complements PACCAR's state-of-the-art engine facility in the Netherlands.  "This will be PACCAR's most technologically advanced and environmentally friendly facility," shared Jim Cardillo, executive vice president.  "The facility will initially hire approximately two hundred employees and it is anticipated that there will be five hundred employees as production increases over time.  Additional employment opportunities, which will generate significant economic benefits to the region, will be created during the construction phase and as a result of suppliers expanding their capacity in the area," added Cardillo.
"We appreciate the outstanding support from the State of Mississippi and Lowndes County in partnering with PACCAR to bring this significant economic investment to the area. The construction of the engine facility marks a strategic milestone and we are pleased to be working closely with the state and local agencies on the planning of the infrastructure for the business," stated Richard Bangert, vice president. "PACCAR has an outstanding record of community involvement at all of the company's major manufacturing locations.  During the last three years, PACCAR has contributed over $14 million in educational grants to universities worldwide.  We look forward to developing a close relationship with Mississippi State University and regional community colleges by investing in their advanced engineering programs, as well as providing ongoing educational opportunities for our employees," added Bangert.
PACCAR is a global technology leader in the design, manufacture and customer support of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates.  It also provides financial services and information technology and distributes truck parts related to its principal business.
