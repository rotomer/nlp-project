Capital Investment Program
Groundbreaking of PACCAR's new $400 million engine production facility and technology center in Columbus, Mississippi occurred on July 17.  The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and local business and civic leaders.  The facility, scheduled for completion in 2009, will manufacture 12.9-liter and 9.2-liter diesel engines for Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF vehicles and complements PACCAR's new world-class engine facility in the Netherlands.  "This will be PACCAR's most technologically advanced and environmentally friendly engine facility," shared Jim Cardillo, executive vice president.
In April 2007, PACCAR Parts opened its new 260,000-square-foot parts distribution center (PDC) on a 33-acre site in Oklahoma City.

"Upon completion of the new Budapest facility, PACCAR will operate 13 PDCs, providing daily delivery of aftermarket parts to PACCAR's growing base of dealers and customers," said Rick Gorman, PACCAR vice president and PACCAR Parts general manager.

These strategic capital investments will enable the aftermarket parts business to continue its strong double-digit growth."

"The expansion of the Chillicothe plant will increase Kenworth capacity by 20 percent, positioning it for market expansion, as well as enhance the industry-leading quality of Kenworth vehicles," said Bob Christensen, PACCAR vice president and Kenworth general manager.
