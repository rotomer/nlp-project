"The severe recession is impacting our customers in North America and Europe.  The Purchasing Managers' Indexes for manufacturing in Europe and North America is at 20-year lows," said Jim Cardillo, president.  "Build rate reductions and temporary plant shutdowns have been implemented in Europe and North America in the fourth quarter 2008.  Truck segment gross margins are expected to be approximately 11 percent this quarter, similar to 2001, due to challenging markets worldwide.  Reduced build rates and lower margins are expected to continue throughout 2009.  U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales in 2009 are estimated to be 150,000-180,000 units, and the heavy-truck market registrations in Europe are estimated to be 200,000-240,000 units.  PACCAR continues to rigorously reduce operating expenses and capital expenditures to align our business with the current market."
