FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 "PACCAR reported increased revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2012," said Mark Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer. "PACCAR's second quarter results reflect the benefits of higher truck sales in North and South America and good financial services results worldwide as compared to the second quarter of 2011. The weak economic growth in the United States, coupled with the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone, could dampen truck orders for the remainder of 2012. I am very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered excellent results to our shareholders and customers."
July 24, 2012, Bellevue, Washington
"PACCAR's strong balance sheet and consistent profitability have enabled ongoing investments which enhance PACCAR's global operations, deliver excellent operating efficiency and support the development of innovative new products. During the second quarter, Kenworth and Peterbilt began production of their new T680 and Model 579 trucks, and DAF showcased its new PACCAR MX 13-liter Euro 6 engine. These investments will contribute to the company's long-term growth," said Pigott.
PACCAR earned $297.2 million ($0.83 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2012, a 24 percent increase compared to $239.7 million ($0.65 per diluted share) earned in the second quarter last year. Second quarter net sales and financial services revenues were $4.46 billion, compared to $3.96 billion reported in 2011. Net sales and financial services revenues for the first six months of 2012 were $9.23 billion, up 27 percent compared to $7.24 billion last year. For the first six months of 2012, PACCAR reported net income of $624.5 million ($1.75 per diluted share), an increase of 44 percent compared to the $433.0 million ($1.18 per diluted share) in 2011.

"Over the past twelve months, PACCAR has purchased 12.8 million PACCAR shares for a total investment of $477.1 million," noted Ron Armstrong, PACCAR president. "PACCAR's excellent net profits and strong cash flow make the company's shares an attractive long-term investment."

Global Truck Markets
DAF continued to strengthen its position in the European truck market, achieving a market share of 16.0 percent in the above 16-tonne segment in the first five months of 2012. "DAF is one of the market leaders in the European tractor segment as fleets recognize DAF's product quality leadership, low operating costs and excellent resale value," said Harrie Schippers, DAF president.

The DAF product range offers premium quality, low operating costs and the industry-leading PACCAR MX engine," said Bob Christensen, PACCAR executive vice president. "The production of DAF trucks in Brasil in 2013 is an exciting development which will add to PACCAR's sales in South America."
For over 40 years, PACCAR's Kenworth vehicles have earned a significant market share in many South American countries in the Andean region. "The successful introduction of DAF vehicles into Chile, Ecuador and Peru in 2011 helped PACCAR achieve a record level of vehicle sales in the region," said Sam Means, PACCAR vice president.

"PACCAR's natural gas engine platforms offer an efficient and clean technology that benefits customers in a wide range of applications," commented Craig Brewster, PACCAR vice president.

Many PACCAR facilities in the U.S. and Europe have also successfully achieved zero waste to land-fill' status."
