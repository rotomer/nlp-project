Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy
Monthly Operating Report
            On May 30, 2002, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) filed its monthly operating report for the month ended April 30, 2002, with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (Bankruptcy Court). The Utility's monthly operating report includes an unaudited income statement for the month and an unaudited balance sheet dated as of the end of the month.  These unaudited financial statements are attached as Exhibit 99 to this report. Although not included in Exhibit 99, the monthly operating report also includes a statement of receipts and disbursements, as well as other information.  The preliminary financial statements were prepared using certain assumptions and estimates that are subject to revision.  Any adjustments for these estimates (based upon changes in facts and circumstances, further analysis, and other factors) will be reflected in the financial statements in the period during which such adjustments are made.  These adjustments could have a material impact on reported results in the future.
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors
As previously disclosed, on June 17, 2002, the disclosure statements describing the Utilitys proposed plan of reorganization (PG&E Plan) and the competing alternative proposed plan of reorganization sponsored by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will be mailed to creditors.  On May 31, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court approved the inclusion in the solicitation package of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (OCC) report and recommendations regarding the competing plans of reorganization.
With respect to the PG&E Plan, the OCC report highlights the critical prerequisite that the new securities proposed to be issued achieve investment grade status, and their belief that this may be successfully achieved.  The OCC report also mentions the objections that will likely be raised by the CPUC during confirmation involving preemption of certain state laws.  Lastly, the OCC report states that if the PG&E Plan is confirmed it will likely face legal challenge from the CPUC and the State of California.
With respect to the CPUC plan, the OCC report states that the CPUC has failed to convince the OCC that the reorganized Utility will achieve investment grade status under the alternate plan.  The report also states that while the CPUC has asserted in its disclosure statement that the reorganized Utility will be regulated in a way to allow it to recover reasonable, prudently incurred costs and will have an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return, the CPUC has failed to accept the OCCs suggestions concerning objective mechanisms to address their concerns regarding these issues.  These two uncertainties cause the OCC to identify as a risk whether the CPUC plan ultimately can be financed. 
The OCC report concludes with a recommendation that creditors vote in favor of both plans, but does not take a position on a preference vote for either plan.  They state that the PG&E Plan is financially feasible, but faces significant delays because of potential legal challenges.   They call the CPUC plan simpler than the PG&E Plan, but state that it may not be financeable and also faces litigation delay. 
The OCC stated that it will continue to represent and protect the interests of creditors and seek a consensual resolution of the disputes between the proponents of the PG&E Plan and the CPUC plan.
