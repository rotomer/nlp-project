Item 5. Other Events As previously disclosed, in November 2001 and March 2002, PG&E Corporation amended its March 1, 2001 Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Old Credit Agreement") with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC") and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. ("LCPI") and their assignees (collectively, the "Existing Lenders"). The amendments provided PG&E Corporation the option to extend the original $1 billion aggregate term loan credit facility for two one-year periods so that the maturity date could be extended until as late as March 2, 2006, contingent upon PG&E Corporation making a principal repayment of $308 million by June 3, 2002. On June 3, 2002, PG&E Corporation made the principal repayment of $308 million, utilizing current working capital and reducing the principal balance outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement to $692 million. On June 25, 2002, PG&E Corporation entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with GECC (the "Tranche A Lender") and LCPI, and the lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Tranche B Lenders") which amended and restated the Old Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement provides for loans in two tranches. The Tranche A has a principal amount of $600 million (the "Tranche A Loan"), representing the $692 million outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement less $92 million that has been converted to a Tranche B Loan. The Tranche B consists of the $92 million converted loan plus $328 million of new borrowings, for a total of $400 million (the "Tranche B Loan"). The Tranche A Loan will continue to have the same maturity date and extension provisions as the Old Credit Agreement. The Tranche B loan will mature on the earlier of (1) September 2, 2006, or (2) the date of any spin-off of the shares of PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. ("NEG, Inc."), by its indirect parent, PG&E Corporation. The Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan are collectively referred to as the "Loans." The Tranche A Loan continues to be secured by a first priority lien on (1) PG&E Corporation's equity interest in PG&E National Energy Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NEG LLC"and together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the "NEG Group"), (2) NEG LLC's equity interest in NEG, Inc., and (3) certain cash interest reserves. The Tranche B Loan is secured by a second priority lien on the equity interests in NEG LLC and NEG, Inc. and by a first priority lien on certain other cash interest reserves. In addition, the Tranche B Loan is subordinated to the Tranche A Loan. PG&E Corporation issued to the lenders warrants to purchase approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation at an exercise price of $0.01 per share ("Warrants"). As previously disclosed, in connection with the Old Credit Agreement, affiliates of the Existing Lenders received an option to purchase 3 percent of the shares of NEG, Inc., determined on a fully diluted basis, at an exercise price of $1.00. The option may be exercised at any time until 45 days after the full repayment of the Tranche A Loan. In addition, under the Old Credit Agreement, PG&E Corporation's exercise of each of its one-year extensions of the loan was
conditioned upon NEG LLC granting affiliates of the Existing Lenders an additional option to purchase one percent of the common stock of NEG, Inc., determined on a fully-diluted basis, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. As a result of the New Credit Agreement, the one percent has been reduced to approximately .87 percent of the common stock of NEG, Inc. (reflecting the reduction in the principal amount of the Tranche A Loan to $600 from the $692 million in loans outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement). The option may be exercised at any time from the relevant extension date until 45 days after full repayment or maturity of the Tranche A Loan. NEG LLC has the right to call the option after repayment of the Tranche A Loan in full at a cash purchase price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares, or, at the election of NEG LLC if an initial public offering of the shares of NEG, Inc. ("IPO") has occurred, by delivering the underlying shares. If an IPO has not occurred prior to repayment of the Tranche A Loan in full, the holders of the option have the right to require NEG LLC or PG&E Corporation to repurchase the option at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares (the "Put Price"), which right is exercisable at any time after the earlier of full repayment of the Tranche A Loan or 45 days before expiration of the option. In addition to the grant of the additional option, PG&E Corporation must pay a fee of 3 percent of the then-outstanding balance of the Tranche A Loan as a condition for PG&E Corporation's exercise of each of the one-year extensions. The New Credit Agreement contains certain limitations on the ability of PG&E Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries to grant liens, consolidate, merge, purchase or sell assets, declare or pay dividends, incur indebtedness or make advances, loans and investments. However, the New Credit Agreement does not limit (1) PG&E Corporation's ability to spin-off its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the "Utility"), substantially in accordance with the Utility's plan of reorganization proposed in the Utility's bankruptcy case pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, (2) the ability of the members of the NEG Group to grant liens, purchase or sell assets, make investments and incur indebtedness in accordance with NEG, Inc.'s business plan, or (3) PG&E Corporation's ability to make investments in the Utility to the extent required by law or regulatory requirements. The New Credit Agreement also generally requires mandatory prepayments of the Loans with the net cash proceeds from incurrence of indebtedness, issuance or sale of equity and sales of assets, the receipt of condemnation or insurance proceeds, and distributions or dividends paid to PG&E Corporation; provided however, that (1) PG&E Corporation may make investments in the Utility with cash proceeds from equity sales or issuances to the extent required by law or regulatory requirements, (2) the NEG Group may use such proceeds, or hold such proceeds in cash, to purchase assets or make investments in accordance with NEG Inc.'s business plan, except that proceeds of an IPO must be used to the extent required to repay the Tranche A Loan. Any mandatory prepayments of the Loans will be applied first to the principal amount of the Tranche A Loan, and after the Tranche A Loan is paid in full, to the principal amount of the Tranche B Loan. The New Credit Agreement also requires PG&E Corporation to maintain an interest reserve account for each of the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loans in an amount equal to one year's interest.
A breach of any covenants would entitle the lenders to declare the Loans to be due and payable. The covenants include requirements that (1) NEG, Inc.'s unsecured long term debt have a credit rating of at least BBB - by Standard & Poor's or Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., (2) the ratio of fair market value of NEG, Inc. to the aggregate amount of principal then outstanding under the Loans be not less than 2 to 1, and (3) PG&E Corporation maintain cash or cash equivalents (including amounts held in the interest reserves) of either 15 percent or 10 percent (depending upon when applicable) of the total principal amount of the Loans outstanding plus the principal amount of the Notes (as described below). Concurrent with the refinancing described above, on June 25, 2002, PG&E Corporation issued $280 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2007 ("Notes"), in a private offering. The Notes are unsecured and are subordinate to the Loans. PG&E Corporation will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually at a rate of 7.50 percent per year. PG&E Corporation has the right, subject to certain limitations, to pay interest by issuing additional Notes in lieu of paying cash. The New Credit Agreement prohibits PG&E Corporation from paying interest on the Notes (1) for 240 days after receipt by the Note trustee of notice delivered by the administrative agent or the Tranche A Lender stating that a default that would permit acceleration has occurred under the New Credit Agreement or (2) if, after such interest payment, PG&E Corporation's cash and cash equivalents are less than 20 percent of the total principal amount of the Loans outstanding plus the principal amount of the Notes, or 15 percent of such amount upon any extension of the Loans. In addition to interest, if PG&E Corporation pays cash dividends to holders of its common stock, Note holders are entitled to receive cash equal to the dividends that would have been paid with respect to the number of shares that the holder would be entitled to receive if the Notes had been converted on the dividend record date. The Notes may be converted by the holders into shares of PG&E Corporation's common stock at a conversion price equal to 119 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock of PG&E Corporation over a 43-day period beginning three days after the closing of the transaction. The conversion price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, including upon consummation of any spin off transaction of the Utility as proposed in its plan of reorganization or a spin off of the shares of NEG, Inc. Following a Change of Control of PG&E Corporation, as such term is defined in the Note indenture, a Note holder has the right to require PG&E Corporation to repurchase the Note holder's Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. PG&E Corporation has agreed to provide, following consummation of a plan of reorganization of the Utility, registration rights in connection with the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants. The net proceeds of the Loans and the Note issuance will be used to fund corporate working capital, repay certain indebtedness, and fund two interest reserve accounts.

(a) Subject to Section 2.12 hereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security, together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Securityholder or such Securityholder's attorney duly authorized in writing, at the office or agency of the Company designated as Registrar or co-registrar pursuant to Section 2.3, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount. The Company shall not charge a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with the transfer or exchange of the Securities from the Securityholder requesting such transfer or exchange. At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged, together with a written instrument of exchange satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Securityholder or such Securityholder's attorney duly authorized in writing, at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. The Company shall not be required to make, and the Registrar need not register, transfers or exchanges of any Securities in respect of which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn by the Holder thereof in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Global Security remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Depositary, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with Section 2.12 and this Section 2.6(b). Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole or in part, to the Depositary, to nominees of the Depositary or to a successor of the Depositary or such successor's nominee. (c) Successive registrations and registrations of transfers and exchanges as aforesaid may be made from time to time as desired, and each such registration shall be noted on the register for the Securities. (d) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities. (e) No Registrar shall be required to make registrations of transfer or exchange of Securities during any periods designated in the text of the Securities or in this Indenture as periods during which such registration of transfers and exchanges need not be made. (f) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and bearing the legends set forth on the forms of
19 Security attached hereto as Exhibits B and C setting forth such restrictions (collectively, the "Legend"), or if a request is made to remove the Legend on a Security, the Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Company and the Registrar the evidence required pursuant to the Legend and pursuant to Section 2.12. Upon (i) provision of such satisfactory evidence or (ii) notification by the Company to the Trustee and Registrar of the sale of such Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from the face of a Security and the Security is subsequently held by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated. (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.6(f) above or Sections 2.12(b) and (c) below, a pledge or other hypothecation of any Security to a bank or other financial institution that is either an accredited investor or a QIB, in connection with any bona fide margin agreement or other loan or financing arrangement shall not be deemed to constitute a "transfer" for purposes of this Indenture. Any foreclosure or other disposition of any Securities so pledged or otherwise hypothecated by such bank or other financial institution shall constitute a "transfer" for all purposes hereunder and shall be made only in accordance with the applicable provisions hereof. Section 2.7 Replacement Securities. If (a) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3 hereof, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or purchase such Security, as the case may be. Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
20 The provisions of this Section 2.7 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. Section 2.8 Outstanding Securities; Determination of Holder's Action. Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those paid pursuant to Section 2.7, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.8 as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate thereof holds the Security; provided, however, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other Act hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or such other obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, only Securities which a Responsible Officer knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time of such determination shall be considered in any such determination (including, without limitation, determinations pursuant to Articles 7 and 10). If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with this Indenture, on the Business Day following a Change of Control Purchase Date, or on Stated Maturity, money sufficient to pay Securities payable on that date, then immediately after such Change of Control Purchase Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, such Securities shall cease to be outstanding and interest, including Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any, on such Securities shall cease to accrue. If a Security is converted in accordance with Article 11, then from and after the time of conversion on the date of conversion, such Security shall cease to be outstanding and interest, including Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Security. Section 2.9 Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the
21 temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.3, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities. Section 2.10 Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3, conversion or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has repurchased, paid for or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or that any Holder has converted pursuant to Article 11. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with the Trustee's customary procedure. Section 2.11 Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of the Security or the payment of any Change of Control Purchase Price in respect thereof, and interest thereon, for the purpose of conversion and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 2.12 Special Transfer Provisions. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, (A) transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with Section 2.6 and Section 2.12(a)(i), (B) transfers of a beneficial interest in a Global Security for a Certificated Security shall comply with Section 2.6, Section 2.12(a)(ii) below and Section 2.12(e)(1) below, and (C) transfers of a Certificated Security shall comply with Section 2.6 and Sections 2.12(a)(iii) and (iv) below. (i) Transfer of Global Security. A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any successor thereof, and no such transfer to any such other person may be registered; provided that this clause (i) shall not prohibit any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security. No transfer of a Security to any person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such person. Nothing in this Section 2.12(a)(i) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 2.12(a).
22 (ii) Restrictions on Transfer of a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security for a Certificated Security. A beneficial interest in a Global Security may not be exchanged for a Certificated Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below and in Section 2.12(e)(1) below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security in accordance with Applicable Procedures for a Certificated Security in the form satisfactory to the Trustee, together with: (A) so long as the Securities are Restricted Securities, certification in the form set forth in Exhibit D; (B) written instructions to the Trustee to make, or direct the Registrar to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect a decrease in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such decrease; and (C) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the Legend, then the Trustee shall cause, or direct the Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Registrar, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Security to be decreased by the aggregate principal amount of the Certificated Security to be issued, shall issue such Certificated Security and shall debit or cause to be debited to the account of the person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Security so issued. (iii) Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities. When Certificated Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request: (y) to register the transfer of such Certificated Securities; or (z) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount of Certificated Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities surrendered for transfer or exchange: (1) shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing; and (2) so long as such Securities are Restricted Securities, such Securities are being transferred or exchanged pursuant to an effective registration
23 statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) below, and are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (A) if such Certificated Securities are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect; or (B) if such Certificated Securities are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect; or (C) if such Certificated Securities are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration, (i) a certification to that effect (in the form set forth in Exhibit D, if applicable) and (ii) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the Legend. (iv) Restrictions on Transfer of a Certificated Security for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security. A Certificated Security may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Certificated Security, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, together with: (I) so long as the Securities are Restricted Securities, certification, in the form set forth in Exhibit F, that either (x) the Holder of such Certificated Security is a QIB and is exchanging its Certificated Security for an interest in the Global Security pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or (y) the Securities represented by such Certificated Security are being transferred in compliance with Rule 144A; and (II) written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Registrar to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such increase, then the Trustee shall cancel such Certificated Security and cause, or direct the Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Registrar, the aggregate principal amount of Securities represented by the Global Security to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Certificated Security to be exchanged, and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the person
24 specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Security so cancelled. If no Global Securities are then outstanding, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Security in the appropriate principal amount. (b) Subject to the succeeding Section (c), every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend including the delivery of an opinion of counsel, if so provided. Whenever any Restricted Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered in a name other than that of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit D, dated the date of such surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such restrictions on transfer. The Registrar shall not be required to accept for such registration of transfer or exchange any Security not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate. (c) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(k). Any Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144, by an opinion of counsel having substantial experience in practice under the Securities Act and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company, addressed to the Company and in form acceptable to the Company, to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144), be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive Legend. The Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities Act. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement. (d) As used in the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 2.12, the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, transfer, loan or other disposition of any Security; but subject to the provisions of Section 2.6(g) above. (e) The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in whole or in part for a Security registered in the name of any person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the
25 Depositary in the event that (i) the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or such Depositary has ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (i) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (ii) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security. (2) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, shall have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof. (3) Subject to the provisions of clause (5) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members (as defined below) and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities. (4) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (1) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons. (5) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the "Agent Members") nor any other persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect
26 to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security. Section 2.13 CUSIP Numbers. The Company may issue the Securities with one or more "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. Section 2.14 PIK Securities. Pursuant to the terms of the Securities, the Company may pay interest or Liquidated Damages in the form of PIK Securities. If the Conversion Price is of an amount such that the Securities initially issued under this Indenture meet the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i), but if the Company does not receive satisfactory evidence that any PIK Securities issued under this Indenture in respect of any interest or Liquidated Damages payment will meet the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i) and as a result of the failure of such PIK Securities to meet such requirements, such PIK Securities would not be transferable under Rule 144A, the Company shall issue such PIK Securities in a new series under this Indenture, with terms and provisions identical in all respects to all other Securities issued under this Indenture, provided that such series of PIK Securities shall have a separate CUSIP number. ARTICLE III REPURCHASE UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL Section 3.1 Purchase of Securities at Option of the Holder upon Change of Control. (a) (1) In the event that a Change of Control shall occur, each Holder shall have the right, at the Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase, and upon the exercise of such right the Company shall repurchase, all of such Holder's Securities, or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to any integral multiple of $1,000 (or any integral multiple of $1.00 in the case of a PIK Security) (provided that no single Security may be repurchased in part unless the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be outstanding after such repurchase is equal to an integral multiple of $1,000 (or any integral multiple of $1.00 in the case of a PIK Security)), on the date specified in the Change of Control Notice given pursuant to
27 Section 3.1(b) in connection with such Change of Control (the "Change of Control Purchase Date") that is no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of such notice at a purchase price specified in Section 5 of the Securities, (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in Section 3.1(c). In the event that the Company fails to deliver a Change of Control Notice on or prior to the 30th day after the occurrence of a Change of Control, then the Company shall be deemed to have delivered a Change of Control Notice on such 30th day and shall be deemed to have specified a Change of Control Date of the 60th day after the occurrence of such Change of Control. A "Change of Control" will be deemed to have occurred at such time after the Securities are originally issued when any of the following events shall occur: (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions, of shares of the Capital Stock of the Company entitling that person to exercise 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Capital Stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors, other than any acquisition by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its employee benefit plans (except that any of those persons shall be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities it has the right to acquire, whether the right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); (ii) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Company does not consist of Continuing Directors; provided that any such change in board membership occurring in connection with a Spin-Off of the POR Spin-Co, shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of Control hereunder; (iii) if the Company engages in one or more Spin-Offs, which together with all other Spin-Offs engaged in by the Company since the date of this Indenture involves the distribution to the Company's shareholders, in the aggregate, of one or more Subsidiaries subject to a Spin-Off (a "Spin-Co") having total Net Assets with a fair market value of more than 55% of the fair market value of the Company's total consolidated Net Assets at the time of the first Spin-Off occurring after the date of this Indenture (in each case, as determined by a Qualified Appraiser within 120 days prior to the date of any such Spin-Off); provided, however, that no such event shall be deemed to constitute a Change of Control hereunder if it occurs prior to the time that the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (unless pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to repurchase any Securities tendered following the occurrence of any Change of Control in accordance with the provisions of Article III hereof, including a Spin-Off described in this clause (iii)), have been repaid in full; and provided, further that in no event shall a Spin-Off of the POR Spin-Co, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute a Change of Control hereunder if such Spin-Off is the first Spin-Off occurring after the date of this Indenture;
28 (iv) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which, together with the aggregate fair market value of all Capital Stock distributed in all prior Spin-Offs engaged in by the Company since the date of this Indenture other than the POR Spin-Off ("Spun-Off Value"), have an aggregate fair market value which is greater than 50% of the sum of the fair market value of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (as determined by a Qualified Appraiser) at the time of such disposition, plus the Spun-Off Value, to any "person" (as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act); or (v) the Company consolidates or merges with or into any other person or any merger of another person into the Company, other than: (A) any transaction: (1) that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of the Company's Capital Stock and (2) pursuant to which the holders of 50% or more of the total voting power of the Company's Capital Stock entitled to vote generally in elections of directors immediately prior to the transaction, taken as a whole, have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote generally in elections of directors of the continuing or surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such issuance; or (B) any merger primarily for the purpose of changing the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock, if at all, solely into shares of common stock of the surviving entity. A "Continuing Director" shall mean, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who: (i) was a member of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date of this Indenture; or (ii) was nominated for election or elected to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of the new director's nomination or election. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1(a)(1), the Company shall not be required to purchase the Securities of the Holders upon a Change of Control pursuant to this Section 3.1 if: (i) the arithmetic average of the VWAP per share of Common Stock for any five Trading Days within (1) the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending immediately after the later of the Change of Control or the public announcement of the Change of Control, in the case of a Change of Control under clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of "Change of Control" above, or (2) the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending immediately before the Change of Control, in the case of a Change of Control under clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of the definition of "Change of Control" above, equals or exceeds 110% of the Conversion Price of the
29 Securities in effect on each of those five trading days (provided that the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Securities are available for resale under Rule 144 or pursuant to an effective and available resale registration statement under the Securities Act); or (ii) at least 90% of the consideration in the transaction or transactions (other than cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal rights) constituting a Change of Control under clause (iv) or (v) of the definition of "Change of Control" consists of shares of common stock traded or to be traded immediately following a Change of Control on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, and, as a result of the transaction or transactions, the Securities become convertible into that common stock (and any rights attached thereto). For the purposes of this Section 3.1, (x) whether a person is a "beneficial owner" shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and (y) the term "person" includes any syndicate or group that would be deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act. (b) Not earlier than the date the Company provides to the Lenders (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) the Change of Control Offer to Repay Notice (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) pursuant to Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement, but in no event later than 30 days after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall mail a written notice (a "Change of Control Notice") of the Change of Control by first class mail to the Trustee and to each Holder (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law). The Change of Control Notice shall include a form of Change of Control Purchase Notice to be completed by the Holder and shall state: (1) briefly, the events causing a Change of Control and the date of such Change of Control; (2) the date by which the Change of Control Purchase Notice pursuant to this Section 3.1 must be delivered to the Paying Agent in order for a Holder to exercise the repurchase rights; (3) the Change of Control Purchase Date; (4) the Change of Control Purchase Price; (5) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; (6) the Conversion Price and any adjustments thereto; (7) that the Securities as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given may be converted if they are otherwise convertible pursuant to
30 Article 11 hereof only if the Change of Control Purchase Notice has been withdrawn in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; (8) that the Securities must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect payment; (9) that the Change of Control Purchase Price for any Security as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been duly given and not withdrawn will be paid promptly following the later of the Change of Control Purchase Date and the time of surrender of such Security as described in (8); (10) briefly, the procedures the Holder must follow to exercise rights under this Section 3.1; (11) briefly, the conversion rights of the Securities; (12) the procedures for withdrawing a Change of Control Purchase Notice; (13) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Change of Control Purchase Price, interest, if any, on Securities surrendered for purchase by the Company will cease to accrue on and after the Change of Control Purchase Date; and (14) the CUSIP number(s) of the Securities. (c) A Holder may exercise its rights specified in Section 3.1(a) upon delivery of a written notice of purchase (a "Change of Control Purchase Notice") to the Paying Agent at any time on or prior to the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Purchase Date (unless the Company shall specify a later date), specifying: (1) the certificate number of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased or the appropriate depositary procedures if Certificated Securities have not been issued; (2) the portion of the principal amount of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 (or in the case of any PIK Security, which portion must be $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00); and (3) that such Security shall be purchased pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in Section 5 of the Securities and in this Indenture. The delivery of such Security to the Paying Agent with the Change of Control Purchase Notice (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent shall be a condition to the receipt by the Holder of the Change of Control Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Change of Control Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 only if the Security so delivered to the Paying Agent

The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Change of Control Purchase Notice or written withdrawal thereof.

The Company shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the SEC, copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely conclusively on Officers' Certificates). Section 4.3 Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2002) an Officers' Certificate which complies with the requirements of the TIA, stating whether or not to the knowledge of the signers thereof, the Company is in

If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 12.2. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations. Section 4.6 Delivery of Certain Information. At any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon the request of a Holder or any beneficial owner of Securities or holder or beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished Rule 144A Information (as defined below) and any reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or otherwise pursuant to Section 7 of the Registration Rights Agreement, to such Holder or any beneficial owner of Securities or holder or beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock, or to a prospective purchaser of any such security designated by any such holder, as the case may be, to the extent required to permit compliance by such Holder or holder with Rule 144A under the Securities Act in connection with the resale of any such security. "Rule 144A Information" shall be such information as is specified pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Whether a person is a beneficial owner shall be determined by the Company to the Company's reasonable satisfaction. Section 4.7 Restriction on Incurrence of Indebtedness. The Company will not, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Company may incur Indebtedness if the Company's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to be furnished pursuant to Section 4.6 immediately
35 preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided, further, that, if following the date of this Indenture, the Company's Reference Debt is rated Investment Grade, then beginning on the date of such rating, the covenant set forth in this Section 4.7 shall cease and be of no further effect. The provisions of the first paragraph of this covenant shall not apply to the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt") so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby: (i) the incurrence by the Company of additional Indebtedness under one or more Credit Facilities in an amount not to exceed $1.2 billion outstanding at any time (plus the amount of any pay-in-kind payments with respect thereto and any such Indebtedness required to finance Option Debt); (ii) the incurrence by the Company of the Existing Indebtedness; (iii) the incurrence by the Company of Indebtedness represented by the Securities (and any PIK Securities); (iv) the incurrence by the Company of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (iv), not to exceed $35 million at any time outstanding; (v) the incurrence by the Company of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of this paragraph; (vi) the incurrence by the Company of intercompany Indebtedness between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries; provided that such Indebtedness shall be expressly subordinated to, and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of, all amounts under the Securities to the same extent as the Securities are subordinated in right of payment to Senior Debt hereunder; (vii) the incurrence by the Company of Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the normal course of business and consistent with past business practices for the purpose of fixing or hedging currency, commodity or interest rate risk (including with respect to any floating rate Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be outstanding in connection with the conduct of their respective businesses); (viii) the incurrence of Indebtedness solely in respect of bankers' acceptances, letters of credit, surety or performance bonds, all in the ordinary course of business; and
36 (ix) the incurrence by the Company of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (ix), not to exceed $35 million. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through (ix) above as of the date of incurrence thereof or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant as of the date of incurrence thereof, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, classify (or later reclassify in whole or in part, in its sole discretion) such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant. Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.7 shall not apply to the incurrence of any Indebtedness by any Subsidiary of the Company. Section 4.8 Restriction on Spin-Offs. Prior to the repayment in full of all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and other Senior Debt (unless pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, if applicable, and the instruments governing any such other Senior Debt, the Company is permitted to repurchase any Securities tendered following the occurrence of a Change of Control in accordance with the provisions of Article III hereof, the Company shall not effect one or more Spin-Offs in which it disposes, in the aggregate, of one or more Spin-Cos having total Net Assets with a fair market value of more than 55% of the fair market value of Company's total consolidated Net Assets at the time of the first Spin-Off occurring after the date of this Indenture (in each case as determined by a Qualified Appraiser within 120 days prior to any such Spin-Off); provided, however, that in no event shall a Spin-Off of the POR Spin-Co, in and of itself, be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this Section 4.8 if such Spin-Off is the first Spin-Off occurring after the date of this Indenture. Section 4.9 Pass-Through Dividends. Subject to the record date provisions described below, the Company shall pay to each Holder, an amount per Security, in cash, equal to the Cash Dividends, if any, paid by the Company per share of Common Stock multiplied by the principal amount of such Security divided by the Conversion Price in effect on the record date for such payment (a "Pass-Through Dividend"). Pass-Through Dividends, if any, will be payable on the payment date of each such Pass-Through Dividend to Holders as of the record date for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive each such Pass-Through Dividend. Section 4.10 144A Securities Determination. Within five Business Days following the Pricing Period, the Company shall provide to the Trustee and the Securityholders a determination of whether the Securities meet the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i) and (ii) of Rule 144A. Within five Business Days following the issuance of each PIK Security, the Company shall provide to the Trustee and the Securityholders a determination of whether such PIK Security meets the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i) and (ii) of Rule 144A. The Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely on any and all such determinations for purposes of transfer or sale of the securities.
37 ARTICLE V SUBORDINATION Section 5.1 Agreement of Subordination. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Securities issued hereunder by its acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article 5; and each Person holding any Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions. The payment of the principal of and interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on all Securities issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash or payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt of all Senior Debt, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred. No provision of this Article 5 shall prevent the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder. Section 5.2 Payments To Holders. No payment shall be made with respect to the principal of or interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on the Securities, except payments and distributions made by the Trustee as permitted by Section 5.5, if: (i) a default in the payment of principal, premium, interest, rent or other payment obligations due on any Senior Debt (including any failure by the Company to pay any amounts required to be paid under Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing (or, in the case of Senior Debt for which there is a period of grace, in the event of such a default that continues beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument or lease evidencing such Senior Debt), unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist; or (ii) a default, other than a payment default, on any Designated Senior Debt occurs and is continuing that permits holders of such Designated Senior Debt to accelerate its maturity (or, in the case of a lease constituting Designated Senior Debt, that permits the landlord under such lease either to terminate the lease or to require the Company to make an irrevocable offer to terminate the lease following an event of default thereunder) and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a Representative or holder of Designated Senior Debt or the Company. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.5, if the Trustee receives any Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to clause (ii) above, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until (a) at least 420 days shall have elapsed since the initial effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice; and (b) all scheduled payments on the Securities that have come due have been paid in full in cash. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment
38 Blockage Notice to the Trustee (unless such default was waived, cured or otherwise ceased to exist and thereafter subsequently reoccurred) shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice. The Company may and shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Securities upon the earlier of: (a) in the case of a default referred to in clause (i) above, the date upon which the default is cured or waived or ceases to exist, or (b) in the case of a default referred to in clause (ii) above, the earlier of (A) the date on which such default is cured or waived or ceases to exist or (B) 240 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee, if the maturity of such Designated Senior Debt has not been accelerated, unless this Article 5 otherwise prohibits the payment or distribution at the time of such payment or distribution; provided, that if such Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated (or, in the case of a Capital Lease Obligation constituting Designated Senior Debt, if as a result of such default the landlord under such Capital Lease Obligation has given the Company notice of its intention to terminate such Capital Lease Obligation or to require the Company to make an irrevocable offer to terminate the Capital Lease Obligation following an event of default thereunder), the Company shall make no payments on or distributions in respect of the Securities until such Designated Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of that Designated Senior Debt or such acceleration (or terminated, in the case of a lease constituting Designated Senior Debt) has been cured or waived. Upon any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company (whether voluntary or involuntary) or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceedings, all amounts due or to become due upon all Senior Debt shall first be paid in full in cash, or other payments satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, before any payment is made on account of the principal of or interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on the Securities (except payments made pursuant to Article 9 from monies deposited with the Trustee pursuant thereto prior to commencement of proceedings for such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization, so long as such payments are not prohibited by Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code); and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company or bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceeding, any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled, except for the provision of this Article 5, shall (except as aforesaid) be paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders of the Securities or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Debt (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such holders, or as otherwise required by law or a court order) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any Senior Debt may have been
39 issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt in full in cash, or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of the Securities or to the Trustee. For purposes of this Article 5, the words, "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of Capital Stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the terms of which are not substantially better for the holders thereof than the terms of the Securities and the payment of which is subordinated, at least to the extent provided in this Article 5 with respect to the Securities, to the payment of all Senior Debt which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the Senior Debt is (A) assumed without modification and without alteration of the legal, equitable and contractual rights of holders of the Senior Debt by the new corporation, if any, resulting from any reorganization or readjustment, or (B) the legal, equitable and contractual rights of the holders of the Senior Debt are reinstated in accordance with Section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (ii) the legal, equitable and contractual rights of the holders of the Senior Debt under this Article V are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance, transfer or lease of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article 6 shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 5.2 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, comply with the conditions stated in Article 6. In the event of the acceleration of the Securities because of an Event of Default, no payment or distribution shall be made to the Trustee or any Holder of Securities in respect of the principal of or interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on the Securities by the Company, except payments and distributions made by the Trustee as permitted by Section 5.5, until all Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt or such acceleration is rescinded in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall notify, within one Business Day, the holders of Senior Debt of such acceleration. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (including, without limitation, by way of setoff or otherwise), prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities before all Senior Debt is paid in full, in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, or provision is made for such payment thereof in accordance with its terms in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior Debt or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt in full, in cash or other payment
40 satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Debt. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Article 8. This Section 5.2 shall be subject to the further provisions of Section 5.5. Section 5.3 Subrogation Of Securities Subject to the payment in full, in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt of all Senior Debt, the rights of the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is subordinated to other indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Debt until the principal of and interest (including additional amounts, if any) on the Senior Debt shall be paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of the Securities; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Debt of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article 5, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5, to or for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt, and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of the Senior Debt; and no payments or distributions of cash, property or securities to or for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities pursuant to the subrogation provisions of this Article 5, which would otherwise have been paid to the holders of Senior Debt shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or for the account of the Securities. It is understood that the provisions of this Article 5 are and are intended solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Debt, on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article 5 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Debt, and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of and interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price, Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article 5 of the holders of Senior Debt in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 5, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article 8, and the Holders of the Securities
41 shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 5. Section 5.4 Authorization To Effect Subordination. Each Holder of a Security by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 5 and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Section 5.5 Notice To Trustee. The Company shall give prompt written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate to a Responsible Officer and to any Paying Agent of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee or any Paying Agent in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 5 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5, unless and until a Responsible Officer shall have received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust Office from the Company (in the form of an Officers' Certificate) or a Representative or a holder or holders of Senior Debt or from any trustee thereof; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article 8, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided that if on a date not less than one Business Day prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Security) the Trustee shall not have received, with respect to such monies, the notice provided for in this Section 5.5, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after such prior date. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 5 to the contrary, nothing shall prevent any payment by the Trustee to the Holders of monies deposited with it pursuant to Article 8, and any such payment shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 5. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Article 8, shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Representative or a person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a Representative or a holder of Senior Debt or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 5, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or
42 distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 5, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. Section 5.6 Trustee's Relation To Senior Debt. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 5 in respect of any Senior Debt at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Debt, and nothing in Article 8 or elsewhere in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article 5, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt and, subject to the provisions of Article 8, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of Senior Debt if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Securities, the Company or any other person money or assets to which any holder of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 5 or otherwise. Section 5.7 No Impairment Of Subordination. (a) No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. (b) Without the limiting the generality of subsection (a) of this Section 5.7, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article V or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (3) release any person liable in any manner for the collection or payment of Senior Debt; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other person; provided that in no event shall any such actions limit the right of the Holders of the Securities to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the Securities pursuant to Article VII hereof or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder or under applicable laws if the taking of such action does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture. Section 5.8 Certain Conversions Deemed Payment. For the purposes of this Article 5 only, (1) neither the issuance and delivery of junior securities upon conversion of Securities in accordance with Article 11, the payment of interest in the form of PIK Securities
43 nor the payment of Pass-Through Dividends shall be deemed to constitute a payment or distribution on account of the principal of or interest on Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities, and (2) the payment, issuance or delivery of cash (except in satisfaction of fractional shares pursuant to Section 11.2), property or securities (other than junior securities) upon conversion of a Security shall be deemed to constitute payment on account of the principal of such Security. For the purposes of this Section 5.8, the term "junior securities" means (a) shares of any stock of any class of the Company, or (b) securities of the Company which are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Debt which may be outstanding at the time of issuance or delivery of such securities to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. Nothing contained in this Article 5 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of any Security to convert such Security in accordance with Article 11. Section 5.9 Article Applicable To Paying Agents. If at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee. Section 5.10 Senior Debt Entitled To Rely. The holders of Senior Debt (including, without limitation, Designated Senior Debt) shall have the right to rely upon this Article 5, and no amendment or modification of the provisions contained herein shall diminish the rights of such holders unless such holders shall have agreed in writing thereto. Section 5.11 Continuing Offer. This Article V shall constitute a continuing offer to all persons who, in reliance upon such provisions, become holders of, or continue to hold Senior Debt; and such provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt; and such holders are made obligees hereunder and they or each of them individually or through their representative may enforce such provisions. Section 5.12 Authorization of the Initial Tranche A Lender to File Claims, etc. In the event that (i) a bankruptcy proceeding shall be commenced by or against the Company and (ii) on or before the date which is ten Business Days before the last date upon which the Trustee is required to file a proof of claim in such bankruptcy proceeding the Trustee (if the claims of the Holders have not been scheduled by the Company in its filing as undisputed) has not filed a proof of claim in respect of the Securities, then, in such event, each Holder hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers (without imposing any obligation on) the Initial Tranche A Lender (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) under the circumstances set forth in Section 2.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement to file such proof of claim in respect of the Securities owing to the Holders. The proceeds of all such claims shall be applied as required by the provisions of the Indenture. Each Holder hereby authorizes the Trustee to irrevocably appoint the Initial Tranche A Lender as its attorney-in-fact and to execute and deliver to the Initial Tranche A Lender all such further instruments confirming the foregoing appointment and authorization, and all such proofs of claim and other instruments, and to take all such other action as may be reasonably requested by the Initial Tranche A Lender in order to enable the Initial Tranche A Lender to,
44 enforce all claims upon or in respect of the Securities owing to the Holders. Any such Lender shall deliver copies of claims or instruments to the Trustee with instructions for the Trustee to deliver the same to each Holder. In the event that the Tranche A Loans and the other Senior Obligations (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) then due and payable have been repaid in full, the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have the rights of the Initial Tranche A Lender hereunder. Section 5.13 Section 5.13 Limitation on Remedies. (a) During any Standstill Period, except as expressly permitted by and subject to the terms of this Indenture, the Holders shall have no right to (i) take any action or institute any proceedings to collect or enforce the payment of any of the principal of or interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) or other payment obligation of the Company in respect of the Securities under the Indenture or the Purchase Agreement, (ii) commence, prosecute or participate in any administrative, legal or equitable action against the Company relating to the Securities (it being understood that the Holders of the Securities may participate in any such action in which any Lender (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or its representative is participating (and not commenced by the Holders of the Securities in such capacity) to the extent necessary to maintain their claims to, and to preserve their rights in respect of, the Securities), (iii) commence or join in the commencement of a proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or other similar law in their capacity as Holders of Securities (it being understood that the Holders of the Securities may participate in any such proceeding not commenced by the Holders of the Securities in such capacity to the extent necessary to maintain their claims to, and to preserve their rights in respect of, the Securities), or (iv) direct the Trustee to do any of the foregoing. As used herein, "Standstill Period" shall mean any period during which payment of principal of or interest (including the payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price and Liquidated Damages, if any, but excluding Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on the Securities is not permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 5.2 as a result of a default under the Credit Agreement, provided, however, that in no event shall such period exceed 240 days. (b) If any Holder, in violation of the provisions herein set forth, shall commence, prosecute or participate in any suit, action, case or proceeding against the Company, any Lender may, at the expense of the Holders, intervene and interpose as a defense or plea the provisions set forth herein, and such Lender shall, in any event, be entitled to restrain the enforcement of the payment provisions of the Securities in its own name in the same suit, action, case or proceeding or in any independent suit, action, case or proceeding. ARTICLE VI SUCCESSOR CORPORATION Section 6.1 When Company May Merge or Transfer Assets. The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Designated Asset Amount of its properties and assets to any Person, unless:
45 (a) either (1) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (2) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease the Designated Asset Amount of the properties and assets of the Company (i) shall be organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and (c) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this Article 6 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied. (d) The successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the successor Person to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the Company herein; and thereafter, except in the case of a lease and obligations the Company may have under a supplemental indenture, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities. Subject to Section 10.6, the Company, the Trustee and the successor Person shall enter into a supplemental indenture to evidence the succession and substitution of such successor Person and such discharge and release of the Company. ARTICLE VII DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 7.1 Events of Default. So long as any Securities are outstanding, each of the following shall be an "Event of Default": (1) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal amount on any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, whether or not prohibited by the provisions of Article 5; (2) the Company defaults in its obligation to repurchase any Security, or any portion thereof, upon the exercise by the Holder of such Holder's right to require the Company to purchase such Securities pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.1 hereof, whether or not prohibited by the provisions of Article 5; (3) the Company defaults in the payment of any accrued and unpaid interest, including the payment of any Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends on any Security,
46 or any other amount due on any Securities, in each case when due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days, whether or not prohibited by the provisions of Article 5; (4) the Company fails to comply with any of its agreements or covenants in the Securities or this Indenture (other than those referred to in clause (1) through (3) above) and such failure continues for a period of 60 consecutive days after receipt by the Company of a Notice of Default; (5) a default under any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $150 million or more, for a period of 30 days after written notice of default is given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, which default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness, unless such acceleration is waived, cured, rescinded or annulled or unless such indebtedness is discharged; it being understood, however, for the avoidance of doubt that to the extent that any Indebtedness of PG&E has been accelerated and is subject to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy, Case No. 01 30923 DM, such acceleration shall not be deemed to constitute a default or event of default hereunder; (6) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, in an involuntary case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; it being understood, however, for the avoidance of doubt that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy, Case No. 01 30923 DM, shall not be deemed to constitute a default or event of default hereunder; or (7) the commencement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, of a voluntary case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, in an involuntary case or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against the Company, or the filing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable law, or the consent by the Company to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or the taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or
47 the making by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary, in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; it being understood, however, for the avoidance of doubt that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy, Case No. 01 30923 DM, shall not be deemed to constitute a default or event of default hereunder. A Default under clause (4) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default (and such Default is not waived) within the time specified in clause (4) above after receipt of such notice. Any such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default." The Trustee shall, within 90 days of the occurrence of a Default, give to the Holders of the Securities notice of all uncured Defaults known to it and written notice of any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto; provided, however, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if it, in good faith, determines that the withholding of such notice is in the best interest of such Holders, except in the case of a Default under clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) above. Section 7.2 Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(6) or (7) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends, if any, on all the Securities to be immediately due and payable. The Trustee shall deliver a copy of any such notice to the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement and to the Initial Tranche A Lender (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), but the Trustee's failure to deliver a copy of any such notice to the Administrative Agent or the Initial Tranche A Lender shall not impair or affect the validity of such notice and the Trustee will have no liability to the Administrative Agent or the Initial Tranche A Lender with respect thereto. Upon such a declaration, such accelerated amount shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(6) or (7) occurs (with respect to the Company) and is continuing, the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends, if any, on all the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder) may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends, if any, that have become due solely as a result of acceleration and if all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 8.7 have been paid. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
48 Section 7.3 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including Change of Control Purchase Price, Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends, if any, on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. Section 7.4 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder), may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) an Event of Default described in Section 7.1(1), 7.1(2) or 7.1(3), (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 10.2 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected or (iii) a Default which constitutes a failure to convert any Security in accordance with the terms of Article 11. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. This Section 7.4 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)(1)(B) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 7.5 Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines in good faith is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it. This Section 7.5 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(A) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)(1)(A) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 7.6 Limitation on Suits. A Securityholder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of security or indemnity; and
49 (4) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of any other Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over any other Securityholder. Section 7.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. The right of any Holder to receive payment of the principal amount, the Change of Control Purchase Price, Pass-Through Dividends, Liquidated Damages or interest in respect of the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, and to convert the Securities in accordance with Article 11, or, except as provided in Section 5.13, to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or the right to convert, shall not be impaired or affected adversely without the consent of such Holder. Section 7.8 Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default described in Section 7.1(1), (2), (3) or (4) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount owing with respect to the Securities and the amounts provided for in Section 8.7. Section 7.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal amount, Change of Control Purchase Price, Pass-Through Dividends, Liquidated Damages or interest in respect of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any such amount) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal amount, Change of Control Purchase Price, Pass-Through Dividends, Liquidated Damages or interest and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel or any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.7) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.7. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
50 adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. Section 7.10 Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 7, it shall pay out the money in the following order: FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 8.7; SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for the principal amount, Change of Control Purchase Price, Pass-Through Dividends, Liquidated Damages or interest, or any other amount due and owing on the Securities or to the Holders from the Company, as the case may be, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and payable on the Securities; and THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section 7.10. At least 15 days before such record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder and the Company a notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Section 7.11 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 7.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 8.7 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding. This Section 7.11 shall be in lieu of Section 315(e) of the TIA and such Section 315(e) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 7.12 Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal amount or Change of Control Purchase Price in respect of Securities, Pass-Through Dividends, Liquidated Damages or any interest on such amounts, as contemplated herein, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
51 ARTICLE VIII TRUSTEE Section 8.1 Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee conforming to the requirements of this Indenture, but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture, but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein. This Section 8.1(b) shall be in lieu of Section 315(a) of the TIA and such Section 315(a) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

The Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.

Subject to its duties and responsibilities under the TIA, (a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (c) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (d) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken by it in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred under this Indenture; (e) subject to Section 8.1(c), the Trustee may consult with counsel selected by it and any advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel; (f) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; (g) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order and any Board Resolution; (h) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
53 request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney at the sole cost of the Company and shall incur no liability or additional liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation; (i) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture; (j) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other person employed to act hereunder; and (k) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded. Section 8.3 Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, Conversion Agent or co-registrar may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 8.10 and 8.11. Section 8.4 Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use or application of the proceeds from the Securities, it shall not be responsible for any statement in the registration statement for the Securities under the Securities Act or in any offering document for the Securities, the Indenture or the Securities (other than its certificate of authentication), or the determination as to which beneficial owners are entitled to receive any notices hereunder. Section 8.5 Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall give to each Securityholder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, within 15 days after it is known to the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except in the case of a Default described in Section 7.1(1), (2), (3) or (4), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Securityholders. The preceding sentence shall be in lieu of the proviso to Section 315(b) of the TIA and such proviso is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. The Trustee shall not be
54 deemed to have knowledge of a Default unless a Responsible Officer has received written notice of such Default, which notice specifically references this Indenture and the Securities. Section 8.6 Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder and such others in compliance with TIA Section 313(a) a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), if required by such Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify the Trustee promptly whenever the Securities become listed on any securities exchange and of any delisting thereof. Section 8.7 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company agrees: (a) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited (to the extent permitted by law) by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses, advances and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (c) to indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their agents for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, damage, claim, liability, cost or expense (including attorney's fees and expenses, and taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee)) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 8.7, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except amounts held in trust to pay the principal amount, Change of Control Purchase Price, Liquidated Damages, Pass-Through Dividends or interest, as the case may be, on particular Securities. The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 7.1(6) or (7), the expenses including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel, are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.
55 Section 8.8 Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company; provided, however, no such resignation shall be effective until a successor Trustee has accepted its appointment pursuant to this Section 8.8. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 8.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (3) a receiver or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint, by resolution of its Board of Directors, a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company satisfactory in form and substance to the retiring Trustee and the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 8.7. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 8.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Section 8.9 Successor Trustee by Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. Section 8.10 Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1) and (5) and 310(b). The Trustee (or its parent holding company) shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA Section 310(b).
56 Section 8.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. ARTICLE IX DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE Section 9.1 Discharge of Liability on Securities. If, after all Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement have been fully repaid, (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced or repaid pursuant to Section 2.7) for cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Securities shall become due and payable within one year, and, in each case, the Company deposits with the Trustee cash sufficient to pay all amounts due and owing on all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.7), and if in each case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company or otherwise payable to the Holders in relation thereto, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.7, cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall join in the execution of a document prepared by the Company acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company. Section 9.2 Repayment to the Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability to the Securityholders with respect to such money or securities for that period commencing after the return thereof. ARTICLE X AMENDMENTS Section 10.1 Without Consent of Holders. The Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without the consent of any Securityholder to: (a) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of Securities; (b) surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; (c) provide for conversion rights of Holders of Securities if any reclassification or change of the Common Stock or any consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets occurs;
57 (d) provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to the Holders of Securities in the case of a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease pursuant to Article 6 hereof; (e) reduce the Conversion Price; provided, however, that such reduction in the Conversion Price shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account tax and other consequences of such reduction); (f) comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; (g) cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein or which is otherwise defective; provided, however, that such action pursuant to this clause (g) does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution), adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect; and (h) add or modify any other provisions herein with respect to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company and the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and that will not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution), adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities. Section 10.2 With Consent of Holders. Except as provided below in this Section 10.2, this Indenture or the Securities may be amended, modified or supplemented, and noncompliance in any particular instance with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities may be waived, in each case with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding. Without the written consent or the affirmative vote of each Holder of Securities affected thereby, an amendment or waiver under this Section 10.2 may not: (a) change the maturity of the principal amount of, or the date any installment of interest, including the payment of Liquidated Damages, is due on, any Security; (b) reduce the principal amount of, or interest, including the payment of Liquidated Damages payable on, or the Change of Control Purchase Price of, any Security; (c) change the currency of any amount owed or owing under the Security or any interest thereon from U.S. Dollars; (d) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment or with respect to, or conversion of, any Security; (e) adversely affect, following the occurrence of a Change of Control, the repurchase right of the Holders of the Securities as provided in Article III or the right of the Holders of the Securities to convert any Security as provided in Article XI;
58 (f) modify any of the provisions of this Section 10.2, or reduce the principal amount of outstanding Securities required to waive a default, except to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby; or (g) reduce the percentage of the principal amount of the outstanding Securities the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver provided for in this Indenture. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 10.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section 10.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice briefly describing the amendment. Section 10.3 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall comply with the TIA. Section 10.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents, Waivers and Actions. Until an amendment, waiver or other action by Holders becomes effective, a consent thereto by a Holder of a Security hereunder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same obligation as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent, waiver or action is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent, waiver or action as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, waiver or action becomes effective. After an amendment, waiver or action becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder. Section 10.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for outstanding Securities. Section 10.6 Trustee to Sign Supplemental Indentures. The Trustee shall sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 10 if the amendment contained therein does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign such supplemental indenture. In signing such supplemental indenture the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to the provisions of Section 8.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Section 10.7 Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes;
59 and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. ARTICLE XI CONVERSIONS Section 11.1 Conversion Privilege. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 11, a Holder of a Security shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, provided that, in the case of any PIK Securities, the portion to be converted may be $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00) of such Security into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of conversion, at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities. (b) The Company shall, one Business Day following the Pricing Period, provide to the Trustee the computation of the Conversion Price, which determination shall be made in accordance with Section 11.10 and Section 11.11. Upon receipt of the Company's calculation of the Conversion Price, the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the Holders of such Conversion Price. (c) No Holder may convert any Security to the extent that, immediately following any such conversion and upon receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, such Holder would either (i) become or be included in any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, that is the single largest holder of voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise become the single largest holder of the Common Stock) (the "Shareholder Limitation") or (ii) beneficially own or be included in any "person" that beneficially owns in excess of 4.9% of the voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise beneficially own in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock) (the "4.9% Limitation") after, in either case, giving effect to such conversion (the Shareholder Limitation and the 4.9% Limitation are collectively referred to herein as the "Conversion Limitations"). The determinations of the number of shares that (i) constitute 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock or voting power and (ii) are held by the largest holder will be made in reliance upon the information contained in publicly available filings made with the SEC unless the Company is aware that such information is incorrect and made the correct information public and disclosed such information to the Holders at the time of any such proposed conversion. In order to facilitate compliance with the foregoing, each Holder will be required to make a representation that it and its Affiliates will comply with the Conversion Limitations immediately after converting any Security and receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. (d) Notwithstanding the Shareholder Limitation, however, a Holder may convert Securities that would otherwise cause such Holder to hold shares of Common Stock in excess of the Shareholder Limitation if, as to such excess number of shares of Common Stock (the "Excess Shares"), such Holder (i) irrevocably covenants to the Company to sell such Excess Shares within 10 days after the date of conversion and (ii) confirms that it has, on or prior to such
60 conversion date, entered into a binding arrangement to sell the Excess Shares within 10 days after such conversion date either (a) in a regular way transaction on a national securities exchange (or the principal market where the shares of Common Stock are then traded) or (b) to one or more persons that are not "affiliates" (used herein as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act) of such Holder ("Third Parties"), each of whom represents for the benefit of the Company that, upon purchase of the applicable Excess Shares, such Third Party, together with its affiliates, will not be the beneficial owner of a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Shareholder Limitation. In addition, such Holder, by converting its Securities, shall be deemed to agree to vote the applicable Excess Shares only in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company or any Third Party that has agreed to purchase such shares, if any record date for a vote of the Common Stock is established for any day between the conversion date and the consummation of the sale of the applicable Excess Shares. The Shareholder Limitation will cease to have any force and effect upon consummation of the Spin-Off of POR Spin-Co, if, on the date that is 14 days after delivery to the Company of a request by the Majority Holders to such effect (which request may be given no more than once during any 180-day period), the Company shall not have delivered a certificate to the Holders stating that the removal of the Shareholder Limitation would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, not be consistent with the applicable regulatory or other legal requirements. For the purposes of Section 11.1(c) and (d), (x) whether a person is a "beneficial owner" shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and (y) the term "person" includes any syndicate or group that would be deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act. Section 11.2 Conversion Procedure; Conversion Price; Fractional Shares. (a) Each Security shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. The Security will be converted into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price therefor. No payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock or accrued interest on a converted Security, except as described in Section 11.9 hereof. The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with any conversion of Securities, but instead shall, subject to Section 11.3(h) hereof, make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the last Trading Day prior to the date of conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Change of Control Purchase Notice exercising such Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the Section 3.8 hereof. (b) Before any Holder of a Security shall be entitled to convert the same into Common Stock, such Holder shall, in the case of Global Securities, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time, and in the case of Certificated Securities, surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, and shall give written notice to the Company at said office or place that such Holder elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Securities to be converted and
61 the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued. Before any such conversion, a Holder also shall pay all funds required, if any, relating to interest on the Securities, as provided in Section 11.9, and all taxes or duties, if any, as provided in Section 11.8. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at said office or place to such Holder of a Security, or to such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock while the stock transfer books for such stock or the security register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or security register. (c) A Security shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of the surrender of such Securities for conversion as provided above, and the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such Common Stock as of the close of business on such date. (d) In case any Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 11.8 hereof), a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities. Section 11.3 Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: (a) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, pay a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the Common Stock Record Date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction: (1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the Common Stock Record Date fixed for such determination; and (2) the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution.
62 Such reduction shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the Common Stock Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 11.3(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased. Such reduction or increase, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (c) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, issue rights or warrants (other than any rights or warrants referred to in Section 11.3(d)) to all holders of its shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the Current Market Value of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of the announcement of such issuance (treating the conversion price per share of the securities convertible into Common Stock as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into Common Stock and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of such security into Common Stock divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible security), then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date after such date of announcement by a fraction: (1) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the number of shares or securities which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares or securities so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such Current Market Value of the Common Stock; and (2) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of announcement, plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible).
63 Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date of announcement of such issuance. To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants, upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock) actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Value of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. (d) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Securities are outstanding, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its shares of Common Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and the Common Stock is not changed or exchanged), cash, shares of its capital stock (other than any dividends or distributions to which Section 11.3(a) applies), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets, including securities, but excluding (i) any rights or warrants referred to in Section 11.3(c), (ii) dividends or distributions of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) in connection with a reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section 11.4 applies, (iii) Cash Dividends and other distributions paid exclusively in cash and (iv) any Spin-Off as contemplated below (such capital stock, evidence of its indebtedness, cash, other assets or securities being distributed hereinafter in this Section 11.3(d) called the "distributed assets"), then, in each such case, subject to the third and fourth succeeding paragraphs and the last Section of this Section 11.3(d), the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Common Stock Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction: (1) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Value of the Common Stock, less the Fair Market Value on such date of the portion of the distributed assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date) (determined as provided in Section 11.3(g)) on such date; and (2) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Value. Such reduction shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Common Stock Record Date for such distribution. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the
64 Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 11.3(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any distributed assets comprising all or part of such distribution, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period (the "Reference Period") used in computing the Current Market Value pursuant to Section 11.3(g) to the extent possible, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith that determining the Fair Market Value during the Reference Period would not be in the best interest of the Holders. In the event any such distribution consists of shares of Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Company's Subsidiaries (a "Spin-Off"), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: P C' = C x ----- P + U Where: C' = the adjusted Conversion Price. C = the then current Conversion Price. P = the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Common Stock of the Company over the Trading Period. U = the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Common Stock of the applicable Spin-Co over the Trading Period. Trading Period = the 20 consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the tenth Trading Day of the Common Stock after the effectiveness of such Spin-Off. The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such Spin-Off is made and shall become effective immediately after such Spin-Off. Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"), (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock, (ii) are not exercisable and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of shares of Common Stock shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 11.3(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 11.3(d) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event. If such right or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different distributed assets, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, or entitle the holder to purchase a different number or amount of the foregoing or to purchase any
65 of the foregoing at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be deemed to be the date of issuance and record date with respect to a new right or warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant without exercise by the holder thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 11.3(d): (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of shares of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase; and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued. For purposes of this Section 11.3(d) and Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(b) and 11.3(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11.3(d) is applicable that also includes (i) shares of Common Stock, (ii) a subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock to which Section 11.3(b) applies or (iii) rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 11.3(c) applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead to be: (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants, other than such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision or combination or such rights or warrants to which Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(b) and 11.3(c) apply, respectively (and any Conversion Price reduction required by this Section 11.3(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such subdivision or combination or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Price reduction required by Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(b) and 11.3(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except: (A) the Common Stock Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as (i) "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution," "Common Stock Record Date fixed for such determinations" and "Common Stock Record Date" within the meaning of Section 11.3(a), (ii) "the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective" and "the day upon which such combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 11.3(b), and (iii) as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants," "the Common Stock
66 Record Date fixed for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and such "Common Stock Record Date" within the meaning of Section 11.3(c); and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 11.3(a) and any reduction or increase in the number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision or combination shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or distribution. In the event of any distribution referred to in this Section 11.3(d) in which (1) the Fair Market Value of such distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined as provided above) equals or exceeds the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Common Stock Record Date for such distribution or (2) the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Common Stock Record Date for such distribution exceeds the Fair Market Value of such distribution by less than $1.00, then, in each such case, in lieu of an adjustment to the Conversion Price, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Security, in addition to shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of such distribution such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Security immediately prior to the Common Stock Record Date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive the distribution. In the event of any distribution referred to in Section 11.3(c) or 11.3(d), where, in the case of a distribution described in Section 11.3(d), the Fair Market Value of such distribution per share of Common Stock exceeds 10% of the Closing Price of a share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, then, if such distribution would also trigger a conversion right under Section 11.1(b) or the Securities are otherwise convertible pursuant to this Article 11, the Company will be required to give notice to the Holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Time for the distribution and, upon the giving of notice, the Securities may be surrendered for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company gives notice to the Holders of such conversion right, until the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Time or the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. No adjustment to the Conversion Price or the ability of a Holder of a Security to convert will be made if the Holder will otherwise participate in such distribution without conversion. (e) In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of shares tendered) of an aggregate consideration having a Fair Market Value that, combined together with the aggregate amount of the cash, plus the Fair Market Value, as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of
67 which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.3(e) has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Current Market Value of the Common Stock as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time (such excess, the "Excess Amount"), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction: (1) the numerator of which shall be (x) the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time and (ii) the Current Market Value of the Common Stock at the Expiration Time, less (y) the Excess Amount; and (2) the denominator shall be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time and the Current Market Value of the Common Stock at the Expiration Time. Such reduction (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all or a portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such (or such portion of the) tender offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 11.3(e) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the Conversion Price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 11.3(e). Pursuant to rights issued under the Company's preferred share purchase rights plan, if holders of the Securities exercising the right of conversion attaching after the date the rights separate from the underlying Common Stock are not entitled to receive the rights that would otherwise be attributable to the shares of Common Stock received upon conversion, the Conversion Price will be adjusted as though the rights were being distributed to holders of Common Stock on the date of such separation. If such an adjustment is made and the rights are later redeemed, invalidated or terminated, then a corresponding reversing adjustment will be made to the conversion price on an equitable basis. (f) For purposes of this Article 11, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: "Common Stock Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of shares of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the shares of Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
68 "Current Market Value" on any date means the average of the daily Closing Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that if: (1) the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 11.3(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs during such ten consecutive Trading Days, the Closing Price for each Trading Day prior to the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Closing Price by the same fraction by which the Conversion Price is required to be multiplied as a result of such other event; (2) the "ex" date for any event (other than the issuance or distribution requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 11.3(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the Closing Price for each Trading Day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Closing Price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the Conversion Price is required to be multiplied as a result of such other event; and (3) the "ex" date for the issuance or distribution requiring such computation is prior to the day in question, after taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of this proviso, the Closing Price for each Trading Day on or after such "ex" date shall be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash and the Fair Market Value of the evidences of Indebtedness, shares of capital stock or assets being distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock as of the close of business on the day before such "ex" date. For purposes of any computation under Section 11.3(e), if the "ex" date for any event (other than the tender offer requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 11.3(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) occurs on or after the Expiration Time for the tender or exchange offer requiring such computation and prior to the day in question, the Closing Price for each Trading Day on and after the "ex" date for such other event shall be adjusted by dividing such Closing Price by the reciprocal of the fraction by which the Conversion Price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such other event. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date, when used: (1) with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the Closing Price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution; (2) with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock, means the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective; and
69 (3) with respect to any tender or exchange offer, means the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade regular way on such exchange or in such market after the Expiration Time of such offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Price are called for pursuant to this Section 11.3, such adjustments shall be made to the Current Market Value as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of this Section 11.3 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. "Fair Market Value" shall mean the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's length transaction (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error). (g) The Company shall be entitled to make such additional reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by Sections 11.3(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution of Common Stock, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of Common Stock or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above shall not be taxable to the holders of Common Stock for United States Federal income tax purposes. (h) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may, from time to time, reduce the Conversion Price by any amount for any period of time, if such period is at least 20 days and the reduction is irrevocable during the period. Whenever the Conversion Price is reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Trustee and each Holder at the address of such Holder as it appears in the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, at least 15 days prior to the date the reduced Conversion Price takes effect, a notice of the reduction stating the reduced Conversion Price and the period during which it will be in effect. (i) In any case in which this Section 11.3 shall require that any adjustment be made effective as of or retroactively immediately following a Common Stock Record Date, the Company may elect to defer (but only for five Trading Days following the filing of the statement referred to in Section 11.5) issuing to the Holder of any Securities converted after such Common Stock Record Date the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (j) All calculations under this Section 11.3 shall be made to the nearest cent or one-hundredth of a share, with one-half cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 11.3, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an
70 increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price. Any adjustments under this Section 11.3 shall be made successively whenever an event requiring such an adjustment occurs. (k) In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Holder of any Securities thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of stock of the Company other than shares of Common Stock into which the Securities originally were convertible, the Conversion Price of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any such Security shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in subparagraphs (a) through (k) of this Section 11.3, and the provision of Sections 11.1, 11.2 and 11.4 through 11.9 with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to any such other shares and the determination of the Board of Directors as to any such adjustment shall be conclusive. (l) No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 11.3(i) if the effect thereof would be to reduce the Conversion Price below the par value (if any) of the Common Stock or (ii) if the Holders of the Securities otherwise participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11.3; provided that such participation is on terms that include the effect of such adjustment. The Company will take no action to increase the par value of the Common Stock. Section 11.4 Consolidation or Merger of the Company. If any of the following events occurs, namely: (1) any reclassification or change of the outstanding Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination); (2) any merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or combination of the Company with another corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; or (3) any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock; the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture, if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that such Securities shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property or assets (including cash) which such Holder would have been entitled to receive upon such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance had such Securities been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance assuming such holder
71 of Common Stock did not exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance (provided, that if the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-Electing Share"), then for the purposes of this Section 11.4, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, sale or conveyance for each Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-Electing Shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 11. If, in the case of any such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent practicable the provisions providing for the conversion rights set forth in this Article 11. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it appears on the register of the Securities maintained by the Registrar, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section 11.4 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, statutory share exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this Section 11.4 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 11.3 shall not apply. Section 11.5 Notice of Adjustment. Whenever an adjustment in the Conversion Price with respect to the Securities is required: (1) the Company shall forthwith place on file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent for such securities a certificate of the Treasurer of the Company, stating the adjusted Conversion Price determined as provided herein and setting forth in reasonable detail such facts as shall be necessary to show the reason for and the manner of computing such adjustment; and (2) a notice stating that the Conversion Price has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price shall forthwith be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, to
72 each Holder in the manner provided in Section 12.2. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. Section 11.6 Notice in Certain Events. In case: (1) of a consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or conveyance to another Person or entity or group of Persons or entities acting in concert as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company; or (2) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; or (3) of any action triggering an adjustment of the Conversion Price referred to in clauses (x) or (y) below; then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent, and shall cause to be given, to the Holders of the Securities in the manner provided in Section 12.2, at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of any distribution or grant of rights or warrants triggering an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 11, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of record of Common Stock entitled to such distribution, rights or warrants are to be determined, or (y) the date on which any reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up triggering an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Article 11 is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of the proceedings described in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section 11.6. Section 11.7 Company To Reserve Stock: Registration; Listing. (a) The Company shall, in accordance with the laws of the State of California, at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Securities, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all Securities then outstanding into such Common Stock at any time (assuming that, at the time of the computation of such number of shares or securities, all such Securities would be held by a single Holder); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall preclude the Company from satisfying its obligations in respect of the conversion of
73 the Securities by delivery of purchased shares of Common Stock which are then held in the treasury of the Company. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities will upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable and free from all liens and charges and, except as provided in Section 11.8, taxes with respect to the issue thereof. (b) If any shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority before such shares or securities may be issued upon such conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to cause such shares or securities to be duly registered or approved, as the case may be. The Company further covenants that so long as the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, and the Company will endeavor to list the shares of Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of the Securities prior to such delivery upon any other national securities exchange upon which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such delivery. Section 11.8 Taxes on Conversion. The issue of stock certificates on conversion of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes in respect of the issue thereof, and the Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock or the portion, if any, of the Securities which are not so converted in a name other than that in which the Securities so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of such tax or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. Section 11.9 Conversion After Record Date. Except as provided below and in the proviso to this paragraph, if any Securities are surrendered for conversion on any day other than an Interest Payment Date, the Holder of such Securities shall not be entitled to receive any interest that has accrued on such Securities since the prior Interest Payment Date; provided, however that if any Securities are surrendered for conversion within five Business Days prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities, then the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any interest that has accrued on such Securities since the prior Interest Payment Date until the date of Stated Maturity. By delivery to the Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock or other consideration issuable upon conversion in accordance with this Article 11, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities will be deemed to have been paid in full. Except as otherwise set forth in the proviso to the preceding paragraph of this Section 11.9, if any Securities are surrendered for conversion subsequent to the record date
74 preceding an Interest Payment Date but on or prior to such Interest Payment Date, the Holder of such Securities at the close of business on such record date shall receive the interest payable on such Securities on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof. Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any record date preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment by Holders, for the account of the Company, in New York Clearing House funds or other funds of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the Securities being surrendered for conversion. Except as provided in this Section 11.9, no adjustments in respect of payments of interest on Securities surrendered for conversion or any dividends or distributions or interest on the Common Stock issued upon conversion shall be made upon the conversion of any Securities. Section 11.10 Conversion Price. The initial Conversion Price shall be computed by the Company and equal that amount (rounded to four decimal places) arrived at by multiplying 119% by the arithmetic average of the VWAP per share of Common Stock for each Trading Day during the Pricing Period. In addition, should any event(s) occur during the Pricing Period that would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 had the Conversion Price been calculated as of such date, then the Company shall adjust the initial Conversion Price calculated in accordance with the foregoing sentence to fairly reflect any and all such adjustments as would be required by Section 11 (assuming for such purposes that the Conversion Price on any day during the Pricing Period is equal to 119% of the arithmetic average of the VWAP per share of Common Stock for each Trading Day during the Pricing Period immediately preceding such date). The Company shall maintain the listing of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market such that there will be at least 43 Trading Days during the first 75 calendar days following the Closing Date. Section 11.11 Company Determination Final. Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors must make pursuant to this Article 11 shall be conclusive if made in good faith and in accordance with the provisions of this Article, absent manifest error, and set forth in a Board Resolution. Section 11.12 Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions. The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article XI should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 11.4 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with this Article 11. Each Conversion Agent other than the Company shall have the same protection under this Section 11.12 as the Trustee.
75 The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee under the Indenture including, without limitation, its rights to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each Paying Agent or Conversion Agent acting hereunder. Section 11.13 Unconditional Right of Holders to Convert. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to convert its Security in accordance with this Article 11 and to bring an action for the enforcement of any such right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. Section 11.14 Failure to Deliver Shares. If, for any reason whatsoever, the Company shall fail to, or is otherwise unable to, deliver any shares of Common Stock to any Holder upon the proper conversion of such Holder's Securities in accordance with the terms of this Indenture (a "Share Delivery Default"), the Company shall pay liquidated damages (the "Share Liquidated Damages") on all Securities, in amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Securities from the date following such Share Delivery Default. All accrued Liquidated Damages shall be paid either (i) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check or (ii) in PIK Securities, in each case on the next interest payment date or, if earlier, the Maturity Date. Following the cure of each such Share Delivery Default with respect to each such Holder's Securities, the accrual of Liquidated Damages with respect to the Securities will cease. Section 11.15 Common Stock Restricted Securities Legends. Unless such Common Stock has been sold pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act or is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(k), each stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Securities will bear the legend set forth on Exhibit G hereto (the "Common Stock Restricted Securities Legend"). The Common Stock Restricted Securities Legend may be removed from any stock certificate representing shares of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of any Security if there is delivered to the Company such evidence required by the Common Stock Restricted Securities Legend. Upon provision of such satisfactory evidence, at the written direction of the Company, the transfer agent for the Common Stock shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for the stock certificate or stock certificates representing such shares of Common Stock bearing such legend, one or more new stock certificates representing a like aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that do not bear such legend. If the Common Stock Restricted Securities Legend has been removed from a stock certificate representing shares of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of any Security as provided above, no other stock certificates representing shares of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of such Security shall bear such legend, unless the Company has reasonable cause to believe that such shares of Common Stock are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144.
76 ARTICLE XII MISCELLANEOUS Section 12.1 Trust Indenture Act Controls. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF GLOBAL SECURITY] 7.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of 7.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "Securities") of PG&E Corporation, a California corporation (including any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, the "Company"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of June 25, 2002 (together with any supplemental indenture thereto, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). The terms of the Security include those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("TIA"), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Security and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 1. Interest The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of the Securities at the interest rate of 7.50% (the "Interest Rate") from the date of issuance until repayment in full at June 30, 2007, or until an earlier repurchase. The Company will pay Interest on this Security semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing December 31, 2002. The Securities shall bear interest from June 25, 2002 until the principal amount thereof is paid or made available for payment, or until such date on which the Securities are converted or purchased as provided herein at a rate of 7.50% per annum. Interest on the Securities shall be computed (i) for any full semi-annual period for which a particular Interest Rate is applicable, on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and (ii) for any period for which a particular Interest Rate is applicable for less than a full semiannual period for which Interest is calculated, on the basis of a 30-day month and, for such periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed over a 30-day month. The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, during the term of the Securities, to make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date prior to the Maturity Date or to make payments on any accrued Liquidated Damages by issuing additional 7.50% Convertible Preferred Notes due 2007 (the "PIK Securities"), on not less than 30 days (and not more than 45 days) notice to the Trustee and notice to the Holders (the "PIK Notice") prior to each such Interest Payment Date; provided that on the Maturity Date the Company shall be required to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities, and any outstanding Liquidated Damages, in cash, and no PIK Notice shall be given with respect to such last interest payment date. The PIK Securities shall be issued under the Indenture and, except to the extent set forth in Section 2.14 of the Indenture, shall in all respects be identical to the originally issued Securities. A-3
No PIK Securities may be issued in denominations of less than $1.00 of principal amount (and such PIK Securities must be issued in integral multiples of $1.00) and no fractional PIK Securities may be issued in lieu of cash interest pursuant to the fourth paragraph of this Section 1 and the Company shall, instead, pay a cash adjustment in the same manner as provided in the Indenture with respect to the conversion of Securities in shares of Common Stock. If this Security is repurchased by the Company on a date that is after the record date and prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, interest and additional amounts, if any, accrued and unpaid hereon to but not including the applicable Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, will be paid to the same Holder to whom the Company pays the principal of this Security. A Holder of any Security at the close of business on a record date will be entitled to receive interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on such Security on the corresponding Interest Payment Date. Interest on Securities converted after a record date but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date (other than any Security whose maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date) will be paid to the Holder of the Securities on the record date but, upon conversion, the Holder must pay the Company the interest, Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any, which have accrued and will be paid on such Interest Payment Date upon receipt of such amounts from the Company. If the principal amount hereof or any portion of such principal amount or any interest, including the payment of Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any, on any Security is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 5 hereof or upon the Stated Maturity of this Security), then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear interest at 1% over the then currently applicable rate, compounded semi-annually, which interest shall accrue from the date on which such overdue amount was originally due to the date of payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable on demand. Subject to the record date provisions described in the Indenture, the Company shall pay to each Holder an amount per Security equal to the Cash Dividends, if any, paid by the Company per share of Common Stock multiplied by the principal amount of such Security divided by the Conversion Price in effect on the record date for such payment. Pass-Through Dividends, if any, will be payable on the payment date of each such Pass-Through Dividend to Holders as of the record date for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive each such Pass-Through Dividend. 2. Method of Payment. Except as provided below, interest and Liquidated Damages will be paid (i) on the Global Securities to DTC in immediately available funds, (ii) to the person in whose name Securities are registered at the close of business on the record date, (a) on any Certificated Securities having an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or less, by check mailed to the Holders of such Securities; (b) on any Securities having an aggregate principal amount of more than $5,000,000, A-4
by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the election of the Holders of those Securities; and (c) in the case of interest or Liquidated Damages payable in kind, by deposit or delivery of PIK Securities. At Stated Maturity the Company will pay principal and interest in cash on Securities at the Company's office for payment, which initially will be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in cash in respect of the Change of Control Purchase Price and amounts payable at Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to the Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money. 3. Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. Initially, U.S. Bank, N.A. (the "Trustee") will act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any of the Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar. 4. Indenture. This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 7.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007, issued under the Indenture. The terms of this Security include those stated in the Indenture and those required by or made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, as in effect on the date of the Indenture. This Security is subject to all such terms, and the Holder of this Note is referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Securities are general unsecured subordinated obligations of the Company limited to $280,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities aggregate principal amount permitted to be outstanding at any time may exceed the amount set forth in the foregoing sentence only by an amount sufficient to permit payments of interest or Liquidated Damages in PIK Securities as provided for in the Indenture. 5. Purchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder. At the option of the Holder by provision of a Change of Control Purchase Notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to offer to purchase the Securities held by such Holder (or any portion of the principal amount hereof that is at least an integral multiple of $1,000 (or in the case of any PIK Security, at least an integral multiple of $1), provided that the portion of the principal amount of the Security to be outstanding after such purchase is at least equal to $1,000 (or, in the case of a PIK Security, at least $1) within 30 days after the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company for a Change of Control Purchase Price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, A-5
including any Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any, payable with respect to such Security on the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Change of Control Purchase Date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the delivery of the notice described in the preceding sentence. The Change of Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash. Holders have the right to withdraw any Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. If cash sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Change of Control Purchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent, on the Business Day following the Change of Control Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) (including Liquidated Damages and Pass-Through Dividends, if any) immediately after such Change of Control Purchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the Change of Control Purchase Price upon surrender of such Security. 6. Conversion. (a) Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, a Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion, if the portion to be converted is $1,000 or an integral multiple $1,000 (or, in the case of a PIK Security, the portion to be converted may be $1.00 or an integral multiple of $1.00), of such security into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date. (b) No Holder may convert any Security to the extent that, immediately following any such conversion and upon receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, such Holder would either (i) become or be included in any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, that is the single largest holder of voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise become the single largest holder of the Common Stock) (the "Shareholder Limitation") or (ii) beneficially own or be included in any "person" that beneficially owns in excess of 4.9% of the voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise beneficially own in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock) (the "4.9% Limitation") after, in either case, giving effect to such conversion (the Shareholder Limitation and the 4.9% Limitation are collectively referred to herein as the "Conversion Limitations"). The determinations of the number of shares that (i) constitute 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock or voting power and (ii) are held by the largest holder will be made in reliance upon the information contained in publicly available filings made with the SEC unless the Company is aware that such information is incorrect and has made the correct information public and disclosed such information to the Holders at the time of any such proposed conversion. In order to facilitate compliance with the foregoing, each Holder will be required to make a representation that it and its Affiliates will comply with the Conversion Limitations immediately after converting any Security and receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. A-6
(c) Notwithstanding the Shareholder Limitation, however, a Holder may convert Securities that would otherwise cause such Holder to hold shares of Common Stock in excess of the Shareholder Limitation if, as to such excess number of shares of Common Stock, (the "Excess Shares"), such Holder (i) irrevocably covenants to the Company to sell such Excess Shares within 10 days after the date of conversion and (ii) confirms that it has, on or prior to such conversion date, entered into a binding arrangement to sell the Excess Shares within 10 days after such conversion date either (a) in a regular way transaction on a national securities exchange (or the principal market where the shares of Common Stock are then traded) or (b) to one or more persons that are not "affiliates" (used herein as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act) of such Holder ("Third Parties"), each of whom represents for the benefit of the company that, upon purchase of the applicable Excess Shares, such Third Party, together with its affiliates, will not be the beneficial owner of a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Shareholder Limitation. In addition, such Holder, by converting its securities, shall be deemed to agree to vote the applicable Excess Shares only in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company or any Third Party that has agreed to purchase such shares, if any record date for a vote of the Common Stock is established for any day between the conversion date and the consummation of the sale of the applicable Excess Shares. The Shareholder Limitation will cease to have any force and effect upon consummation of a Spin-Off of POR Spin-Co, if, on the date that is 14 days after delivery to the Company of a request by the Majority Holders to such effect (which request may be given no more than once during any 180-day period), the Company shall not have delivered a certificate to the Holders stating that the removal of the Shareholder Limitation would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, not be consistent with the applicable regulatory or other legal requirements. A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Change of Control Purchase Notice, exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security, may be converted only if such Change of Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial Conversion Price shall be computed by the Company and equal that amount (rounded to four decimal places) arrived at by multiplying 119% by the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price or "VWAP" (as defined in the Indenture) per share of Common Stock for a fixed 43 Trading Day period beginning on and including the third Trading Day after the Closing Date, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice below (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Security, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture. A-7
If the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock or (iii) conveys, transfers or leases its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the right to convert a Security into shares of Common Stock may be changed into a right to convert it into securities, cash or other assets of the Company or such other Person, in each case in accordance with the Indenture. 7. Subordination of Securities. The indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is, to the extent and in the manner provided in Article 5 of the Indenture, expressly subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt of the Company, as defined in the Indenture, whether outstanding at the date of the Indenture or thereafter incurred, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect to such subordination. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions and authorizes the Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and appoints the Trustee his or her attorney-in-fact for such purpose. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest (including the Change of Control Purchase Price, Liquidated Damages or Pass-Through Dividends, if any) on this Security at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. 8. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 (or in the case of PIK Securities, denominations of $1.00 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1.00). A Holder may register, transfer or exchange of Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements, legal opinions and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Securities in respect of which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn. 9. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Security shall be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes. 10. Unclaimed Money or Securities. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such payment shall have been due. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person after the date upon which such payment shall have become due. A-8
11. Amendment; Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities. The Indenture and the Securities may also be amended by the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of any Holder, in certain circumstances set forth in the Indenture; provided, that certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities may not be amended without the consent of each affected Holder. 12. Defaults and Remedies. If any Event of Default with respect to the Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 13. Trustee Dealings with the Company. Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 14. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. 15. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side of this Security. 16. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

(f) Such Purchaser has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by such Purchaser; assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding agreement of such Purchaser, enforceable against such Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally. (g) Such Purchaser is a resident of that jurisdiction specified in its address for notices set forth below the signature of such Purchaser where it appears on the signature page(s) of this Agreement. (h) Such Purchaser is not acquiring the Securities with assets of any "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such Purchaser or to any officer, employee or controlling person of such Purchaser. (b) Promptly after receipt by a Purchaser who is acquiring Securities hereunder under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, such Purchaser shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Section 8, notify the Company in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided, further, that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such Purchaser otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against such Purchaser, and it shall notify the Company thereof, the Company shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such Purchaser. After notice from the Company to such Purchaser of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Company shall not be liable to such Purchaser under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Purchaser in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that such Purchaser shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent jointly such Purchaser and its respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by such Purchaser against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of such Purchaser it is advisable for such Purchaser and such officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented 15
by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall, (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (c) To the extent that the undertaking in this Section 8 by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of the Purchasers who are acquiring Securities hereunder which is permissible under applicable law. 9.

Shelf Registration. (a) The Issuer shall use its best efforts to: (i) not later than the date that is 90 days after the date (the "Registration Trigger Date") of the consummation of a "plan of reorganization" under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to PG&E, cause to be filed a registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (together with any amendments thereto, the "Shelf Registration Statement"), which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities held by Holders that have provided the information required pursuant to the terms of Section 2(b) hereof; (ii) cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission not later than 180 days after the Registration Trigger Date (the "Effectiveness Target Date"); and (iii) keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Section 6(b) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that (A) it is available for resales by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities entitled to the benefit of this Agreement and (B) conforms with the requirements of this Agreement and the Securities Act for a period (the "Effectiveness Period") of: (1) two years following the date of original issuance of the Warrants; or (2) such shorter period that will terminate when (x) all of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities are able to sell all Transfer Restricted Securities immediately without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto, (y) all Transfer Restricted Securities have ceased to be outstanding (whether as a
5 result of repurchase and cancellation, conversion or otherwise) or (z) all Transfer Restricted Securities have been registered under the Shelf Registration Statement and have been sold in accordance therewith. (b) No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be permitted to include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless such Holder completes a Selling Securityholder Notice and Questionnaire, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (with such amendments or modifications as the Issuer may deem necessary to reflect the circumstances of the proposed registration) (the "Questionnaire"), and delivers it to the Issuer prior to or on the 15th Business Day after such Holder's receipt of the Questionnaire by the Issuer in writing (such deadline, the "Questionnaire Deadline"). Prior to such time, each Holder may complete the Questionnaire and deliver it to the Issuer prior to such request and, as a result, shall be entitled to have its Transfer Restricted Securities included in the initial Shelf Registration Statement filed with the Commission. In addition, upon receipt of one or more written requests for additional information from the Issuer, each Holder who intends to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement shall furnish to the Issuer in writing, within 15 Business Days after such Holder's receipt of such request, such additional information regarding such Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of its Transfer Restricted Securities, in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus included therein and in any application to be filed with or under state securities law, as the Issuer may reasonably request. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 3 hereof unless such Holder shall have provided all such reasonably requested information prior to or on the Questionnaire Deadline. Each Holder whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement agrees to furnish promptly to the Issuer all information required to be disclosed in order to make information previously furnished to the Issuer by such Holder not materially misleading. 3. Liquidated Damages. (a) If: (i) the Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Target Date; or (ii) except as provided in Section 6(b)(i) hereof, the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and declared effective but, during the Effectiveness Period, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without there being filed with the Commission within ten Business Days a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that cures such failure and, in the case of a post-effective amendment, is itself immediately declared effective; (each such event referred to in foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a "Registration Default"), the Issuer hereby agrees, subject to Section 2(b), to pay liquidated damages ("Liquidated Dmages") with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities on a monthly basis in
6 an amount such that, each Warrant shall evidence the right to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest ten millionth) obtained from the following formula: N' = N x 1.005 Where: N' = the adjusted number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by payment of the Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreement). N = the number of Warrant Shares previously issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by payment of the Exercise Price prior to adjustment. To the extent that any Warrants have been previously exercised and Warrant Shares (to the extent that such Warrant Shares are Transfer Restricted Securities) have been issued to a Holder upon such exercise, the Holder of such Warrant Shares shall be entitled to receive additional Warrants Shares in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Warrant Shares held by such Holder at the beginning of each month upon which liquidated damages shall be payable and (ii) 0.005. The adjustments made pursuant to this Section shall be made on a monthly basis beginning on and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default has been cured. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any particular Transfer Restricted Security, the accrual of Liquidated Damages with respect to such Transfer Restricted Security will cease; provided, however, that, in any event, Liquidated Damages shall cease to accrue on the last day of the Effectiveness Period. Except as provided in 8, no Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to any damages for a Registration Default beyond the Liquidated Damages provided for herein. The Liquidated Damages set forth above shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities for such Registration Default. 4. Piggy-Back Registration Rights (a) If the Issuer at any time proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to any Underwritten Offering by the Issuer for its own account or for the account of holders of any Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Common Stock Equivalent to be offered for cash (other than on Form S-4 or S-8) ("Other Holders") then the Issuer shall in each case give written notice (a "Piggy-Back Registration Offer") of such proposed filing to the Holders at least 20 days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to include Transfer Restricted Securities held by them in such registration statement (a "Piggy-Back Registration") pursuant to the provisions set forth below. In such event the right of any Holder to registration pursuant to this Section 4(a), may be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and of the inclusion of such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. If any such Holder desires to have Transfer Restricted Securities registered and included in such Underwritten Offering under this Section 4(a) such Holder shall so notify the Issuer in writing
7 within ten days after the receipt by such Holder of the written notice provided for in the preceding sentence (which notification shall set forth the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities for which registration is requested), and the Issuer will use its best efforts to cause all such Transfer Restricted Securities to be registered under the Securities Act to the extent required to permit the disposition in such Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering, as selected by the Issuer, shall advise the Issuer in writing that in its or their opinion the total amount or kind of securities that the Holders, the Issuer and any other Persons or entities intend to include in such offering exceeds the amount that can be sold in such offering without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered by the Issuer, the Issuer shall be required to include in such registration only the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities and securities of other persons or entities, if any, that the managing underwriter or underwriters determine, in its or their sole discretion, can be sold without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered. In such event, (x) in cases initially involving the registration for sale of securities for the Issuer's own account, securities shall be registered in such offering in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities which the Issuer proposes to register and (ii) second, the securities which may have been requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this Agreement and the securities of other Persons entitled to exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments of the Issuer (pro rata based on the amount of securities sought to be registered by such Persons) (y) in cases initially involving the registration for sale of securities for the account of any Other Holders, securities shall be registered in such offering in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities which such Other Holders propose to register, (ii) second, the securities which may have been requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this Agreement and the securities of other Persons entitled to exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments of the Issuer (pro rata based on the amount of securities sought to be registered by such Persons) and (iii) third, the securities which Issuer proposes to register. (b) At any time prior to the date of printing preliminary prospectuses in connection with an Underwritten Offering under Section 4(a), a Holder that previously requested Piggy-Back Registration thereof may withdraw all or part of its Transfer Restricted Securities from such offering by providing notice to such effect to the Issuer. 5. Underwriting Procedures (a) If the Required Holders so request in writing (a "Registration Request"), the Issuer shall effect pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement an Underwritten Offering by giving written notice (an "Underwritten Offering Notice") of the proposed Underwritten Offering to all Holders within 15 calendar days after receipt of a valid Registration Request. Such notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such amount of Transfer Restricted Securities as each Holder may request. The Issuer shall include in such Underwritten Offering all Transfer Restricted Securities for which the Issuer has received written requests for inclusion within 15 calendar days after delivery of the Underwritten Offering Notice, subject to Section 5(b). (b) The Issuer shall cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Holders that have requested Transfer Restricted
8 Securities to be included in an Underwritten Offering undertaken pursuant to Section 5(a) above to include all such Transfer Restricted Securities on the same terms and conditions as all other Transfer Restricted Securities to be included. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such Underwritten Offering advises the Issuer and the selling Holders that the total amount of Transfer Restricted Securities that such Holders propose to include in such Underwritten Offering is such as to materially and adversely affect the success of such Underwritten Offering, then the Issuer shall include in such Underwritten Offering up to the full amount of Transfer Restricted Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering by the Holders (allocated pro rata among the Holders on the basis of the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities initially requested to be included therein by each such Holder) so that the total amount of Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering is the full amount that, in the written opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be sold without materially and adversely affecting the success of such Underwritten Offering. (c) Any Transfer Restricted Securities may be withdrawn from a proposed Underwritten Offering at any time before the execution and delivery by such Holder of the underwriting agreement relating to such Underwritten Offering. (d) The managing underwriter or underwriters of the Underwritten Offering relating thereto shall be selected by the Required Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are included in such offering, subject to the approval of the Issuer. 6. Registration Procedures. (a) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the Issuer shall comply with all the provisions of Section 6(b) hereof and shall use its best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto, shall as expeditiously as possible prepare and file with the Commission a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Securities Act. (b) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement and any Prospectus required by this Agreement to permit the sale or resale of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Issuer shall: (ii) subject to any notice by the Issuer in accordance with this Section 6(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 6(b)(iii)(D), use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the Effectiveness Period, the Issuer shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or
9 omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as practicable thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may suspend the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement by written notice to the Holders for a period (each such period, a "Suspension Period"); provided that the Company shall promptly notify the Holders in writing of the date the Suspension Period will begin and the expected duration of such period; and provided further, that no Suspension Period shall exceed 45 consecutive days and all such Suspension Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of 90 days within any consecutive twelve-month period if: (x) an event occurs and is continuing as a result of which the Shelf Registration Statement would, in the Issuer's reasonable judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (y) the Issuer reasonably determines that the disclosure of such event at such time would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Issuer (and its subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole); Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Holder has, prior to the receipt of notice of the commencement of a Suspension Period, entered into a binding contract to sell any Warrant Shares pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, and in accordance with the plan of distribution therein, the Issuer agrees not to prevent its transfer agent from delivering such Warrant to the purchaser thereof in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Warrant Agreement. The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any information reasonably requested by the transfer agent in connection with any such sale. (ii) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424 and 430A under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.
10 (iii) Advise the underwriter(s), if any, and selling Holders promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) and, if requested by such Persons, to confirm such advice in writing: (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act or any notification with respect to the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, or (D) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event (the nature of which need not be disclosed), during the Effectiveness Period, that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of a Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Holder of Warrants, by accepting the same, agrees to hold any communication from the Company pursuant to this Section 6(b)(iii) in confidence. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time and will provide to the Purchasers and each Holder who is named in the Shelf Registration Statement prompt notice of the withdrawal of any such order.
11 (iv) Furnish to each of the selling Holders and each of the underwriter(s), if any, before filing with the Commission, one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and copies of any Prospectus included therein or any amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus (other than documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of the Shelf Registration Statement), which documents will be subject to the review of such Holders and underwriter(s), if any, for a period of at least ten Business Days (in the case of the Shelf Registration Statement and the initial Prospectus contained therein) and two Business Days (in the case of any amendment or supplement thereto), and the Issuer will not file the Shelf Registration Statement or initial Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus (other than documents incorporated by reference) to which a selling Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement or the underwriter(s), if any, shall reasonably object within ten Business Days prior to the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus and within two Business Days prior to the filing of any amendment or supplement thereto. A selling Holder or underwriter, if any, shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing only if the Shelf Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or omission with respect to the information concerning such Holder or its intended plan of distribution with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. (v) Make available at reasonable times for inspection by one or more representatives of the selling Holders, designated in writing by the Required Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, any underwriter participating in any distribution pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by such selling Holders or any of the underwriter(s), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Issuer as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise any applicable due diligence responsibilities, and cause the Issuer's officers, directors, managers and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative or representatives of the selling Holders, underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement after the filing thereof and before its effectiveness, provided, however, that any information designated by the Issuer as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by the recipient thereof. (vi) If reasonably requested by any selling Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, promptly incorporate in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as such selling Holders and underwriter(s), if any, may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation: (1) information relating to the "Plan of Distribution" of the Transfer Restricted Securities, (2) information with respect the number of Transfer Restricted Securities being sold to such underwriter(s), (3) the purchase price being paid
12 therefor and (4) any other terms of the offering of the Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold in such offering; provided, however, that with respect to any information requested for inclusion by a selling Holder, this clause (vi) shall apply only to such information that relates to the Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold by such selling Holder; and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issuer is notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment. (vii) Deliver to each selling Holder and each of the underwriter(s), if any, without charge, upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably may request; subject to any notice by the Issuer in accordance with this Section 6(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 6(b)(iii) (D), the Issuer hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders and each of the underwriter(s), if any, in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. (viii) The Issuer shall: (A) upon request, furnish to each selling Holder and each underwriter in the case of an underwritten registration where an underwriting agreement is entered into, if any, in such substance and scope as they may reasonably request and as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings for selling security holders, upon the date of closing of any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Registration: (1) opinions, each dated the date of such closing, of counsel to the Issuer covering such of the matters as are customarily covered in legal opinions to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings of securities; and (2) customary comfort letters, dated the date of such closing, from the Issuer's independent accountants (and from any other accountants whose report is contained or incorporated by reference in the Shelf Registration Statement) in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings of securities; (B) set forth in full in the underwriting agreement, if any, indemnification provisions and procedures which provide rights no less protective than those set forth in Section 6 hereof with respect to all parties to be indemnified by the Issuer; and
13 (C) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by such parties to evidence compliance with clause (A) above and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the selling Holders pursuant to this clause (ix). (ix) Before any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the selling Holders, the underwriter(s), if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the selling Holders or underwriter(s), if any, may reasonably request, use best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required (A) to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or a dealer of securities where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or (B) to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not now so subject. (x) Cooperate with the selling Holders and the underwriter(s), if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends (unless required by applicable securities laws); and enable such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, may request at least two Business Days before any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities made by such selling Holders or underwriter(s). (xi) Use its best efforts to cause the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other U.S. governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the selling Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. (xii) Subject to Section 6(b)(i) hereof, if any fact or event contemplated by Section 6(b)(iii)(D) hereof shall exist or have occurred, use its best efforts to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to any purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.
14 (xiii) Provide CUSIP numbers for all Transfer Restricted Securities not later than the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement and provide the transfer agent with printed certificates for the Transfer Restricted Securities that are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company. (xiv) Cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the NASD and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASD. (xv) Otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and all reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. (xvi) Cause all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be listed or quoted, as the case may be, on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Issuer are then listed or quoted and if not so listed, to be listed on the NASD automated quotation system. (xvii) Provide to each Holder upon written request each document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 and Section 15 of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement. (xviii) If reasonably requested by the underwriters, make appropriate officers of the Issuer available to the underwriters for meetings with prospective purchasers of the Transfer Restricted Securities and prepare and present to potential investors customary "road show" or marketing materials in a manner consistent with other new issuances of other securities similar to the Transfer Restricted Securities; but in no event more than once in any 12 month period. (c) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of any notice (a "Suspension Notice") from the Issuer of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 6(b)(iii)(D) hereof, such Holder will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any underwriter(s) in an Underwritten Offering to, forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until: (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(b)(xii) hereof; or (ii) such Holder is advised in writing by the Issuer that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. If so directed by the Issuer, each Holder will deliver to the Issuer (at the Issuer's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice of suspension.
15 7. Registration Expenses. All expenses incident to the Issuer's performance of or compliance with this Agreement shall be borne by the Issuer regardless of whether a Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings made by the Purchasers or Holders with the NASD); (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing of Prospectuses and certificates for the Warrant Shares) and the Issuer's expenses for messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel to the Issuer and, subject to Section 5(b) below, the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities; (v) all application and filing fees in connection with listing (or authorizing for quotation) the Common Stock on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Issuer (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance).

(b) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, and any other documents delivered to any Holders, the Issuer shall reimburse the Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities being registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements not to exceed $50,000, of not more than one counsel, which shall be such counsel as may be chosen by a Majority of Holders for whose benefit the Shelf Registration Statement is being prepared. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. The Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, such Holder's officers, directors and employees and each person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an "Indemnified Holder"), from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities) ("Liabilities"), to which such Indemnified Holder may become subject, insofar as any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:
16 (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or (B) any blue sky application or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto prepared or executed by the Issuer (or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Issuer expressly for use in such blue sky application or other document or amendment on supplement) filed in any jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities law of any state or other jurisdiction (such application or document being hereinafter called a "Blue Sky Application"); or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall reimburse each Indemnified Holder promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such Liability as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to a Holder in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto or Blue Sky Application in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by such Holder specifically for use therein; and provided, further, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to the underwriter for any Holder or, in the case of any non-underwritten offering, to any Holder or its related Indemnified Holder to the extent that (A) such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (i) such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, failed to send or deliver a copy of the final prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such Holder to the Person asserting the claim from which such Liabilities arise, to the extent such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, was required to send and deliver such final prospectus, and (ii) the final prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or such omission; or (B) such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission in any such prospectus if (x) such untrue statement or omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus, and (y) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Issuer with copies of such prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of a Security to the Person asserting the claim from which such Liability arises. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have to any Indemnified Holder. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Holder and shall survive the transfer of the Transfer Restricted Securities by such Holder. (b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, its officers, directors and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any Liability, in respect thereof, to which the Issuer or any such officer, director, employee or controlling person may become
17 subject, insofar as any such loss, claim, damage or liability or action arises out of, or is based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Blue Sky Application; or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Holder (or its related Indemnified Holder) specifically for use therein, and shall reimburse the Issuer and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Issuer or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such Liability as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Holder may otherwise have to the Issuer or any of its directors, officers, employees or controlling persons and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Holder shall be liable under this Section 8(b) for any amount in excess of the net proceeds to such Holder as a result of the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided, further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that a Majority of Holders shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent jointly a Majority of Holders and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by a Majority of Holders against the Issuer or any of its directors, officers, employees or controlling persons under this Section 8; and, provided, further, that if a Majority of Holders shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to them
18 and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer and its officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, the fees and expenses of a single separate counsel shall be paid by the Issuer. No indemnifying party shall: (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any Liability referred to therein, then the indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect fault of such Person and the indemnifying party, as well as other relevant equitable concerns. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer on the one hand or the Holders on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Issuer and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Liability referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Transfer Restricted Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several and not joint.
19 9. Rule 144. The Issuer shall file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Issuer is not required to file such reports, it will, upon written request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144. The Issuer covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell such Transfer Restricted Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144. The Issuer will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities identified to the Issuer by any purchasers upon request by any Purchaser. Upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Issuer shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to require the Issuer to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act. 10. Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder: (i) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 11. Purchase By Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144) shall resell any Warrants purchased by such Person to any other Person other than to the Issuer or any of its affiliates. 12. Miscellaneous. (a) Remedies. The Issuer acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Issuer to comply with its obligations under Section 2 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Issuer's obligations under Section 2 hereof. The Issuer further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) Adjustments Affecting Transfer Restricted Securities. The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities as a class that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities to include such Transfer Restricted Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. (c) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuer will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with
20 the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. In addition, the Issuer shall not grant to any of its security holders (other than the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in such capacity) the right to include any of its securities in the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in this Agreement other than the Transfer Restricted Securities. The Issuer has not previously entered into any agreement (which has not expired or been terminated) granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person which rights conflict with the provisions hereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 12(c), the Holders agree that the Resale Registration Rights Agreement between the Issuer and the purchasers identified on the signature pages thereto, dated as of the date hereof, is not inconsistent with or otherwise in conflict with the provisions hereof and that the provisions of Section 4 hereof shall not apply to any registrations undertaken pursuant to the provisions thereof. (d) Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Issuer has obtained the written consent of a Majority of Holders. (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, facsimile transmission, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (i) if to a Holder, at the last address provided by such Holder to the Company (in the case of Holders of Warrants) or the transfer agent of the Common Stock (in the case of Holders of Warrant Shares) and (ii) if to the Issuer: PG&E Corporation One Market, Spear Tower Suite 2400 San Francisco, California 94105 Attention: Assistant Treasurer Facsimile: (415) 267-7265 Telephone: (415) 267-7052 With copies to: PG&E Corporation One Market, Spear Tower Suite 2400 San Francisco, California 94105 Attention: Chief Counsel - Corporate Facsimile: (415) 817-8225 Telephone: (415) 817-8200

(f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities; provided, however, that (i) this Agreement shall not inure to the benefit of or be binding upon a successor or assign of a Holder unless and to the extent such successor or assign acquired Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder in compliance with any restrictions on transfer applicable thereto and (ii) nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of the terms of the Warrant Agreement. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Issuer hereby agrees to extend the benefits of this Agreement to subsequent Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who execute a counterpart signature page hereto. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement; provided that a facsimile signature shall be considered due execution and shall be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the signature were an original, not a facsimile signature. (h) Securities Held by the Issuer or Its Affiliates. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Transfer Restricted Securities is required hereunder, Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Issuer or its "affiliates" (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (other than the Purchasers or subsequent Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Transfer Restricted Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage.
22 (i) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (j) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. (k) Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired or invalidated thereby. (l) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and the registration rights granted by the Issuer with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the registration rights granted by the Issuer with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. [signature pages follow]

W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, the Borrower is a party to the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2001 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Existing Credit Agreement"), with the lenders party thereto, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent, and others, pursuant to which such lenders made the Tranche A Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, the "Existing Tranche A Loan") and the Tranche B Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, the "Existing Tranche B Loan"); WHEREAS, the parties hereto wish to amend and restate the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety to modify certain of the terms applicable to the Existing Tranche A Loan, to reflect the repayment of the Existing Tranche B Loan and to provide for the making of an additional Tranche B Loan to the Borrower; and WHEREAS, (i) the Existing Credit Agreement is being amended and restated pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) certain indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated in connection with this Agreement, will be continued under this Agreement and (iii) all obligations of the Covered Parties under the Financing Documents (as such terms are defined herein) and all liens and security interests created under the Financing Documents will be continued, amended and restated as provided herein and therein and will not be cancelled or discharged; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereto agree that, upon the Closing Date, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows: SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 1.1 Defined Terms. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and its Schedules and Exhibits shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Appendix A hereto. 1.2 Rules of Interpretation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the rules of interpretation set forth in Appendix A hereto shall apply to this Agreement. 1.3 Accounting Principles. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all computations and determinations as to financial matters, and all financial statements to be delivered under this Agreement shall be made or prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (including principles of consolidation where appropriate) applied on a consistent basis (except to the extent approved or required by the independent public accountants certifying such statements and disclosed therein).
2 SECTION 2. AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF CREDIT FACILITY. 2.1 Existing Loans; the New Tranche B Commitment. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, on the Closing Date, (i) the $600,000,000 portion of the Existing Tranche A Loan held by GECC shall be continued hereunder as the Tranche A Loan, which shall mature on the earlier of (x) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (y) the Date Certain, (ii) the remaining $92,000,000 portion of the Existing Tranche A Loan not held by GECC shall be automatically converted into, and become a part of, the Tranche B Loan with the identical terms of the Tranche B Loan made pursuant to clause (iii) below, and (iii) each New Tranche B Lender shall make a term loan to the Borrower, and/or continue to hold or acquire a portion of the $92,000,000 amount of the Tranche A Loan converted to a Tranche B Loan pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of the New Tranche B Commitment of such Lender, which term loans made pursuant to this clause (iii) (A) shall be incurred pursuant to a single drawing on the Closing Date, (B) shall be denominated in Dollars, (C) shall be incurred and maintained as Eurodollar Loans, except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2.7(b), (D) shall be made on the Closing Date in an aggregate principal amount which equals the aggregate New Tranche B Commitments, and (E) shall mature on the earlier of (x) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (y) the Tranche B Maturity Date. For the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to the continuation and the conversion described above and the making of the Tranche B Loan on the Closing Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan outstanding on the Closing Date shall be $600,000,000 and $420,000,000, respectively. (b) If the Closing Date has not occurred on or prior to June 26, 2002, then, in such event, (i) except as set forth in clause (ii) below, the Lenders shall have no further obligations or liabilities under any of the Financing Documents and the Financing Documents shall have no further force or effect with respect to the Lenders, but the Borrower's obligation to pay the costs, fees and expenses as provided herein and to indemnify the other parties to the Financing Documents shall not be terminated, modified or diminished in any respect, and (ii) the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Existing Financing Documents shall remain in full force and effect, and no modification thereof shall have been made pursuant hereto. (c) The Loans are available only on the terms and conditions specified hereunder, and once repaid, in whole or in part, at maturity or by prepayment, may not be reborrowed in whole or in part. 2.2 Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior notice of the Tranche B Loan to be incurred hereunder, provided that any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if given before 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on such day. Such notice (the "Notice of Borrowing") shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, in the form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed to specify: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Loan to be incurred, and the date selected to be the Closing Date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) the account information for disbursement of the Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Tranche B Lenders of the contents of such Notice of Borrowing.
3 2.3 Disbursement of Funds. No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Closing Date, each New Tranche B Lender will make available such Lender's pro rata share of the amount of Borrowing requested to be made on such date. All such amounts will be made available in Dollars and in immediately available funds and disbursed to the Borrower as directed by the Borrower. 2.4 Notes. (a) The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made by a Lender shall be evidenced by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "Note"). On the Closing Date, to the extent requested by any Lender, the existing promissory note held by such Lender shall be exchanged for a new Note. (b) The Note issued to a Lender shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to such Lender or its Assignee and be dated the Closing Date (or, if issued after the Closing Date, be dated the date of issuance thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Loan made or continued by, or assigned to, such Lender, as the case may be, and be payable in the outstanding principal amount of the Loan evidenced thereby, (iv) mature, in the case of the Tranche A Loan, on the earlier of (A) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (B) the Date Certain and, in the case of the Tranche B Loan, on the earlier of (A) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (B) the Tranche B Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 2.5 in respect of a Base Rate Loan (if converted pursuant to Section 2.7(b)) or a Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in Section 3.1, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 3.2, and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents. (c) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of the Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of its Note endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of the Loan evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loan. 2.5 Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of any Base Rate Loan from the date of conversion thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(b) until the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate each as in effect from time to time. (b) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date of Borrowing or conversion thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.7(b) at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.
4 (c) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable by the Borrower shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then borne by such Loan. Interest which accrues under this Section 2.5(c) shall be payable on demand. (d) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, (x) quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date, (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment of the outstanding principal amount of such Base Rate Loan, and (z) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand, and (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, (x) on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand (each such date upon which interest shall be payable, an "Interest Payment Date"). (e) Upon each Interest Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for the relevant Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan and shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto. (f) (i) Upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche A Loan, if the Borrower does not on such Interest Payment Date pay the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche A Loan, the amount of such interest shall be withdrawn from the Tranche A Interest Reserve Account and applied to pay such interest. The Tranche A Lenders hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to request such withdrawal under the Tranche A Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement and to pay such interest. (ii) Upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche B Loan, if the Borrower does not on such Interest Payment Date pay the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche B Loan, the amount of such interest shall be withdrawn from the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account and applied to pay such interest. The Tranche B Lenders hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to request such withdrawal under the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement and to pay such interest. (g) Upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of any portion of the Tranche B Loan, in addition to the interest payable in cash as described above, the principal amount of such portion will be increased by a pay-in-kind interest amount calculated on the principal amount of such portion at the rate per annum of 4.00% for the period from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date with respect to such portion (or from the Closing Date in the case of the first such calculation) to the current Interest Payment Date, and such increased principal amount of the Tranche B Loan shall thereafter bear interest (both cash-pay and pay-in-kind) at the same rates as the original principal amount of the Tranche B Loan.
5 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, no interest payment may be made in respect of the Tranche B Loan (other than the pay-in-kind interest provided for in clause (g) above) unless and until any interest then due and payable in respect of the Tranche A Loan shall have been paid in full, and in any event any such payment of interest in respect of the Tranche B Loan shall be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. 2.6 Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives the Notice of Borrowing, or prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrower shall have the right to elect the interest period (each an "Interest Period") applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three or six-month period; provided that (in each case): (i) the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan shall commence on the date of Borrowing or conversion of such Eurodollar Loan and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Eurodollar Loan shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires; (ii) if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month; (iii) if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; (iv) no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a Default or an Event of Default is then in existence; and (v) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of any Eurodollar Loan shall be selected which extends beyond the Date Certain, in the case of the Tranche A Loan, or the Tranche B Maturity Date, in the case of the Tranche B Loan. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Loan, the Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loan as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected a one-month Interest Period effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period. 2.7 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that a Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto): (i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and
6 fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loan of such Lender because of (x) any change since the Closing Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for example, but not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payment to such Lender of the principal of or interest on such Lender's Loan or Note or any other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is doing business, organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar Rate and/or (y) other circumstances (other than with respect to taxes) arising since the Closing Date affecting such Lender (or its Source), the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such market; or (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market; then, and in any such event, such Lender shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) to the Borrower of such determination. Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as such Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Lender no longer exist, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon such Lender's written request therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.7(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by Law. Each Lender, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower (including, but not limited to, such Lender's internal costs for use of its personnel and resources), will use its reasonable efforts to minimize taxes indemnifiable by the Borrower under this Section 2.7(a), including by complying with reasonable requests by the Borrower to do or to refrain from doing any act (including the execution of any certificates or similar documents required to establish an
7 exemption or relief from any tax), if such efforts or any such compliance is, in the good faith discretion of such Lender, of a purely ministerial nature and has no adverse impact on such Lender or any Affiliate or on the business or operations of the foregoing (unless such adverse impact is one of a nature and quality such that it is subject to indemnification and the Borrower has indemnified such Lender against such adverse impact in a manner satisfactory to such Lender determined in its sole discretion). The Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any taxes that may be imposed on it as a consequence of such compliance. (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.7(a)(i) or (ii), the Borrower may, and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.7(a)(iii), the Borrower shall, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to such Lender, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan. (c) If a Lender determines that after the Closing Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender (or its Source) or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this Section 2.7(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Such Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts. 2.8 Compensation. The Borrower agrees to compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loan but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if any prepayment or repayment (including any prepayment or repayment made pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.8 or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2) or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan is made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; or (ii) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Loan when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 2.7(b). 2.9 Extension of Maturity Date. (a) The Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Tranche A Lender not later than thirty (30) days prior to March 2,
8 2003 or September 2, 2003 (if the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan was extended to September 2, 2003), and upon payment of the Extension Fees relating to such extension, extend the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan to the earlier of (i) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (ii) September 2, 2003 or March 2, 2004, as set forth in the Borrower's notice, but in no event shall the Date Certain with respect to the Tranche A Loan be beyond March 2, 2004, unless further extended pursuant to Section 2.9(b) below; provided, that there shall be no extension of the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan pursuant to this Section 2.9(a) if on the date of such extension, a Default or an Event of Default shall be continuing. (b) The Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Tranche A Lender not later than thirty (30) days prior to March 2, 2004 and March 2, 2005 (if the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan was extended to March 2, 2005), and upon payment of the Extension Fees relating to such extension, extend the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan to the earlier of (i) the date of a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc. and (ii) March 2, 2005 or March 2, 2006, respectively, but in no event shall the Date Certain with respect to the Tranche A Loan be beyond March 2, 2006; provided, that there shall be no extension of the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan pursuant to this paragraph (b) if (i) on the date of such extension, a Default or an Event of Default shall be continuing or (ii) on the date of such extension (x) the amount of cash or Cash Equivalents owned by the Borrower in its own name, free and clear of all Liens, plus the aggregate amount on deposit in the Interest Reserve Accounts, is less than 15% of the total principal amount of Loans then outstanding, and (y) the Borrower has not prepaid the Extension Interest Prepayment Amount. (c) Any extension of the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan made pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall become effective on the maturity date in effect immediately prior to giving effect to such extension. 2.10 Conversion of Put Option Purchase Price to Tranche A Loan. (a) In the event that, pursuant to Article VI of the Option Agreement, any Holder exercises its right to put any Option of such Holder to a Purchasing Party on any Put Repurchase Date (as defined in the Option Agreement) prior to the Additional Extended Date Certain, the Put Option Purchase Price (as defined in the Option Agreement) with respect to such put shall be determined in accordance with the Option Agreement, and, as provided in Section 6.04 of the Option Agreement, the amount of such Put Option Purchase Price shall be paid in immediately available funds or, at the Borrower's option, shall be deemed to constitute a Tranche A Loan made by such Holder, or its Affiliate Lender, on such Put Repurchase Date in a principal amount equal to the amount of such Put Option Purchase Price. (b) In the event that, pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of the Option Agreement, the Holders may be entitled to receive an Additional Option (as defined in the Option Agreement) to purchase from LLC in excess of one percent (1.0%) of the total common equity of NEG, Inc. computed on a Fully Diluted Basis (as defined in the Option Agreement) (such excess only, the "Excess Additional Option Percentage"), at Borrower's option, (i) LLC may grant such Additional Option with respect to the Excess Additional Option Percentage in accordance with the terms of Section 2.01(b) of the Option Agreement, or (ii) the amount of the Put Option Purchase Price (as defined in the Option Agreement) with respect to such Excess Additional Option Percentage shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.01(b) of the Option
9 Agreement, and, as provided therein, the amount of such Put Option Purchase Price with respect to such Excess Additional Option Percentage (x) shall be paid in immediately available funds or, at Borrower's option, (y) shall be deemed to constitute a Tranche A Loan made by such Lender on such Put Repurchase Date in a principal amount equal to the amount of such Put Option Purchase Price with respect to such Excess Additional Option Percentage. (c) Any Tranche A Loan arising pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b) shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the Tranche A Loan and shall be evidenced by a Note in a principal amount equal to the applicable Put Option Purchase Price, which Note the Borrower shall duly execute and deliver to such Lender on the applicable Put Repurchase Date. SECTION 3. PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS; TAXES. 3.1 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time on the following terms and conditions: the Borrower shall give each affected Lender prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) (x) at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay a Base Rate Loan and (y) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay a Eurodollar Loan, which notice (in each case) shall specify the amount of such prepayment which shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $10,000,000, and minimum increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; provided that, the Tranche B Loan may not be prepaid until after payment in full of the Tranche A Loan, all other amounts payable to the Tranche A Lender under the Credit Agreement and all amounts payable to each Holder under the Option Agreement in respect of any Put Notice (as defined in the Option Agreement) theretofore delivered by such Holder. Each prepayment of the Tranche B Loan made pursuant to this Section 3.1 on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date shall be accompanied by payment of a prepayment fee equal to (i) if such prepayment is made on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, 2% of the principal amount prepaid and (ii) if such prepayment is made after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, 1% of the principal amount prepaid. 3.2 Mandatory Repayments. (a) The principal amount of each Loan, to the extent then outstanding, shall be repaid at its maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

(a) All payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder and under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as provided in Section 3.4(b), all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is doing business, organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender, for taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is doing business, organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is doing business, organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall reasonably determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will furnish to such Lender within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by such Borrower. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.
14 (b) Any Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.11(a) (unless such Assignee was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment in which case such assignee shall reaffirm its ability to deliver the forms set forth below in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable), on the date of the assignment to such Assignee, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if any such Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C (any such certificate, a "Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each such Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender will deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or such Lender shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section 3.4(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.4(a) but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.4(a) to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
15 in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 3.4, the Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.4(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes that are effective after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of such Taxes. The sole consequence of any Lender failing to comply with the requirement to deliver the Internal Revenue Service Forms or the Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate shall be that the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.4(a) to gross-up payments to be made to such Lender in respect of any resulting U.S. income or similar taxes. (c) Any Lender that is (i) an Assignee pursuant to Section 9.11(a) and (ii) not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes will certify to the Borrower on or prior to the date of the assignment to such Lender that payments to such Lender hereunder and under any Note are, as of the date of such assignment, not subject to any withholding tax imposed by any taxing jurisdiction located outside of the United States. (d) Each Lender, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower (including, but not limited to, the Lender's internal costs for use of its personnel and resources), will use its reasonable efforts to minimize taxes indemnifiable by the Borrower under this Section 3.4, including by complying with reasonable requests by the Borrower to do or to refrain from doing any act (including the execution of any certificates or similar documents required to establish an exemption or relief from any tax), if such efforts or any such compliance is, in the good faith discretion of such Lender, of a purely ministerial nature and has no adverse impact on such Lender or any Affiliate or on the business or operations of the foregoing (unless such adverse impact is one of a nature and quality such that it is subject to indemnification and the Borrower has indemnified such Lender against such adverse impact in a manner satisfactory to such Lender determined in its sole discretion). The Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any taxes that may be imposed on it as a consequence of such compliance. No Lender shall be required to disclose any tax return or filing or any related information it deems confidential and all positions taken by each Lender in any tax return, filing or proceeding shall be within the sole control of such Lender. 3.5 Allocation. The parties agree that the Notes issued by the Borrower under this Agreement and the Options and the Warrants, as applicable, issued by the Borrower under the Option Agreement and the Warrant Agreement, as applicable, will for federal tax purposes, be treated as an "investment unit" as such term is defined under Section 1273(c)(2) of the Code and the parties agree that the consideration paid by each Lender for its Note and Options and Warrants, as applicable, shall be allocated as set forth on Schedule 3.5. 3.6 [OMITTED]. 3.7 Application of Payments; Sharing. (a) Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Section 3.7, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations
16 of the Borrower hereunder, it shall promptly distribute such payment to the Lenders pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received. (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to particular Lenders or to Lenders holding a particular Loan, if it should receive any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Financing Documents, or otherwise), which, in any such case, is in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Obligations obtained by all Lenders, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all the Lenders in such amount; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. 3.8 Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control, the Borrower shall prepare and provide to each Lender a notice (each, a "Change of Control Offer to Repay Notice"), which shall be in the form of Exhibit E-1, and shall include an offer (the "Change of Control Offer to Repay") to prepay on the date (each, a "Change of Control Offer Settlement Date") that is ten (10) Business Days after the date of the Change of Control Offer to Repay Notice, such Lender's Loan, together with a prepayment fee (the "Change of Control Prepayment Fee") for the Tranche B Lender equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Loan, and each Lender wishing to accept the Change of Control Offer to Repay shall reply, in the form of Exhibit E-2 and indicating whether such offer is accepted or rejected in whole or in part (and if so, to what extent) by the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Change of Control Offer Settlement Date, failing which such offer will be considered to have been accepted in whole by such Lender and such repayment will be made by the Borrower to such Lender in respect of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Offer Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to those Lenders who have accepted the Change of Control Offer to Repay the aggregate amount necessary to prepay that portion of the outstanding Loans, together with (for the Tranche B Lenders) the Change of Control Prepayment Fee, in respect of which such Lenders have accepted the Change of Control Offer to Repay in accordance with this Section 3.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment shall be made to the Tranche B Lenders on the Change of Control Offer Settlement Date pursuant to this Section 3.8 unless and until the Tranche A Loan of, and the other Senior Obligations that are then due and payable owing to, those Tranche A Lenders that shall have accepted the Change of Control Offer to Repay have been paid in full.

(e) Settlement.

No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Financing Document and no course of dealing between
69 the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the holder of any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Financing Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the holder of any Note to take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. All remedies, either under this Agreement or any other Financing Document or pursuant to any applicable Law or otherwise afforded to the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be cumulative and not alternative. 9.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries.

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered by facsimile or otherwise shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 9.10 Amendment or Waiver.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no such
70 waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) increase or extend the New Tranche B Commitment of any Lender (it being understood that waivers or modifications after the Closing Date of covenants, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute an increase or extension of any New Tranche B Commitment of any Lender), without the prior written consent of such Lender, (ii) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Financing Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to any Lender hereunder or under any other Financing Document (it being understood that waivers or modifications after the Closing Date of covenants, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute a postponement or delay in any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Financing Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to any Lender hereunder or under any other Financing Document), without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified in any Financing Document on, any Loan of any Lender, without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral except as shall be otherwise provided in any Security Document or other Financing Document or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its respective obligations under this Agreement or any other Financing Document, without the prior written consent of each Lender, (v) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 9.10 or Section 9.1 or 9.2, without the prior written consent of each Lender, (vi) reduce the percentage specified in or otherwise amend the definition of Required Waiver Lenders or Majority Tranche A Lenders or Majority Tranche B Lenders, without the prior written consent of each Lender, (vii) change, amend or modify the principal amount of, or rate of interest on, or the maturity of, any Tranche A Loan, without the prior written consent of the Majority Tranche B Lenders, (viii) change, amend or modify the principal amount of, or rate of interest on, or the maturity of, any Tranche B Loan, without the prior written consent of the Majority Tranche A Lenders, or (ix) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

71 9.11 Assignments, Participations, etc. (a) Each Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, but with prior notice to the Administrative Agent, sell or assign any part of the Loan of such Lender and the other rights and obligations of such Lender to any Person or any assignee thereof (an "Assignee") unless the sale or assignment of the Loan and such other rights and obligations of such Lender would reasonably put the business of the Borrower at a competitive disadvantage, then such sale or assignment shall require the consent of the Borrower. The assigning Lender and the Assignee shall enter into an assignment agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), with respect to the sale or assignment of the Loan to be assigned and, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 9.11, upon execution and delivery of such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to effect the addition of the Assignee, and any reference to the assigning Lender hereunder or under the other Financing Documents shall thereafter refer to such Lender and to the Assignee to the extent of their respective interests, and (ii) the assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment agreement, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the Financing Documents. (b) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and such Lender's Note; provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Note or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or release of all or substantially all of the Collateral, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. (c) A Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.11, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender.
72 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Financing Document to the contrary, any Lender may assign all or any portion of the Loan held by it as collateral security, provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loan or Note made by the Borrower to or for the account of the assigning or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect to such assigned Loan or Note to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. (e) The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this Section 9.11, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.

77 DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR. SECTION 10. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; THE LEAD ARRANGER AND THE BOOK MANAGER. 10.1 Appointment. Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. shall be the Administrative Agent and shall act as specified herein and in the other Financing Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and the holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other Financing Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents or employees. 10.2 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Security Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Financing Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct. The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or by reason of the use of the term "agent" with reference to the Administrative Agent, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Financing Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Financing Document except as expressly set forth herein. 10.3 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each holder of any Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Borrower, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Financing Document or the financial condition of the Borrower or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or
78 any other Financing Document, or the financial condition of the Borrower or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. 10.4 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Required Waiver Lenders or the Majority Tranche A Lenders or the Majority Tranche B Lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Financing Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Waiver Lenders or the Majority Tranche A Lenders or the Majority Tranche B Lenders, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or the holder of any Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Financing Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Waiver Lenders or the Majority Tranche A Lenders or the Majority Tranche B Lenders, as the case may be. 10.5 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Financing Document its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. 10.6 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in proportion to its respective Loan, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Financing Document, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Financing Document; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. 10.7 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, and with respect to any Loan held by it or made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the term "Lender," "Required Waiver Lenders", "Majority Tranche A Lenders", "Majority Tranche B Lenders", "holder of Note" or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.
79 10.8 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor. 10.9 Resignation or Replacement of the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other Financing Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Borrower and each Lender.

(b) The Administrative Agent may be replaced at the written request of the Required Waiver Lenders at any time by such Lenders giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent.

(c) Upon any such notice of resignation or replacement, as the case may be, the Required Waiver Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other financial institution which is a Lender and which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall be continuing) and the Majority Tranche A Lenders and the Majority Tranche B Lenders. (d) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Waiver Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above. (e) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to clause (c) or (d) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of resignation or replacement was given by the Administrative Agent or the Required Waiver Lenders, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent's resignation or replacement shall become effective and the Required Waiver Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any other Financing Document until such time, if any, as the Required Waiver Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above. 10.10 The Lead Arranger and Book Manager. Neither the Lead Arranger nor the Book Manager, in such respective capacity, shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Financing Document, nor shall any of such Persons, in such respective capacities, have any obligations or liabilities hereunder or under any other Financing Document.
80 10.11 Direction to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Each of the Lenders authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and to perform their respective obligations thereunder. Each Lender agrees that it is bound by the provisions in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Lenders to the same extent as if such Lender were a party thereto, including, without limitation, any provisions of the Security Documents requiring the Lenders to indemnify the Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are express third-party beneficiaries of this Section. * * *

The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or any other Financing Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS (a) All monies collected by the Pledgee upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with all other monies received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied at the written instruction of the Majority Tranche A Lenders (or, after the Transition Date, the Majority Tranche B Lenders) for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations in the order provided in the Credit Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. (b) It is understood and agreed that the Pledgor shall remain liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the proceeds of the Collateral hereunder and the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations. 10. PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt given by the Pledgee or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof. INDEMNITY. The Pledgor agrees (i) to indemnify and hold harmless the Pledgee and its successors, assigns, employees, officers, directors, agents and affiliates (individually an "Indemnitee," and collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, judgments and liabilities (including liabilities for penalties) of whatsoever kind or nature, and (ii) to reimburse each Indemnitee for all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in each case growing out of or resulting from this Agreement or the exercise by any Indemnitee of any right or remedy granted to it hereunder or under any other Financing Document (but excluding any claims, demands, losses, judgments and liabilities or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct 9
of such Indemnitee (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision)). In no event shall the Pledgee be liable, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part or on the part of any of its nominees or sub-agents, for any matter or thing in connection with this Agreement other than to account for monies actually received by it in accordance with the terms hereof. If and to the extent that the obligations of the Pledgor under this Section 11 are unenforceable for any reason, the Pledgor hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under applicable Law. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of any Indemnitee. 12. PLEDGEE NOT A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY MEMBER. (a) Nothing herein shall be construed to make the Pledgee liable as a member of the Issuer or the Pledgor and the Pledgee by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (except as referred to in the following sentence) shall not have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of the Issuer or the Pledgor. The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless the Pledgee shall become the absolute owner of Collateral pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Pledgee, the Pledgor and/or any other Person. (b) Except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 12, the Pledgee, by accepting this Agreement, did not intend to become a member of the Issuer or the Pledgor or otherwise be deemed to be a co-venturer with respect to the Pledgor, the Issuer and/or any other Person either before or after an Event of Default shall have occurred. The Pledgee shall have only those powers set forth herein and the Pledgee shall assume none of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of the Issuer or the Pledgor except as provided in the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 12. (c) The Pledgee shall not be obligated to perform or discharge any obligation of the Pledgor as a result of the pledge hereby effected. (d) The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time or in any event obligate the Pledgee to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Collateral. 13. FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER-OF-ATTORNEY. (e) At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Pledgee, and at the sole expense of the Pledgor, the Pledgor will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments and documents and take such further action as the Pledgee reasonably may deem appropriate in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral and in order for the Pledgee to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted, including, without limitation, the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction and the filing of any other equivalent or similar statement or document under any other applicable Law with any other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to the security interests granted hereby. The Pledgor also hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file any such financing or continuation statement 10
without the signature of the Pledgor to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or instrument shall be immediately delivered to the Pledgee and pledged to the Pledgee hereunder, duly endorsed, to the extent necessary, to the Pledgee. The Pledgor shall not change its name, identity, principal place of business or place of organization in any manner unless the Pledgor shall have given the Pledgee at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice thereof and shall have taken, at the Pledgor's sole expense, all action necessary or reasonably requested by the Pledgee in order to continue the perfection and priority of the security interests in the Collateral intended to be created by this Agreement. (a) The Pledgor hereby appoints the Pledgee, such Pledgor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or otherwise, to act from time to time, solely after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the Credit Agreement, in the Pledgee's reasonable discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument which the Pledgee may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. 14.

PLEDGOR'S OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC. The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever (except as provided under Section 20), including, without limitation: (i) any renewal, extension, amendment or modification of or addition or supplement to or deletion from any Financing Document or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or transfer of any thereof; (ii) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument including, without limitation, this Agreement; (iii) any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or its assignee or any acceptance thereof or any release of any security by the Pledgee or its assignee (except as provided under Section 20); (iv) any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under any such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof; or (v) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation 13
or other like proceeding relating to the Pledgor or the Issuer, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding, whether or not the Pledgor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing. 19. REGISTRATION, ETC. (a) If there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, then upon receipt by the Pledgor from the Pledgee of a written request or requests that the Pledgor cause any registration, qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Limited Liability Company Interests, the Pledgor as soon as practicable and at its expense will cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will cause such qualification and compliance to be declared effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested if such registration, qualification or compliance is necessary to permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such Collateral, including, without limitation, registration under the Securities Act, as then in effect (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with any other government requirements, provided, that the Pledgee shall furnish to the Pledgor such information regarding the Pledgee as the Pledgor may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. The Pledgor will cause the Pledgee to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Pledgee such number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Pledgee from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify the Pledgee and all others participating in the distribution of such Collateral against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Pledgor by the Pledgee expressly for use therein. (b) If at any time when the Pledgee shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Limited Liability Company Interests pursuant to Section 7 hereof, and the Collateral or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Pledgee may sell such Collateral or part thereof, as the case may be, by private sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem necessary or reasonably advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without such registration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in any event the Pledgee (i) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale, and (iii) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Collateral or part thereof. In the event of any such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no responsibility or liability, except to the extent incurred by reason of its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, for selling all or any part of the Collateral at a 14
price which the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid. 20. TERMINATION; RELEASE. (a) After payment in full of the Secured Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the security interest created hereby shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall survive any such termination), and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of the Pledgor, will execute and deliver to the Pledgor a proper instrument or instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement, and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the Pledgor (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement, together with any monies at the time held by the Pledgee or any of its sub-agents hereunder. (b) At any time that the Pledgor desires that the Pledgee assign, transfer and deliver Collateral (and releases therefor) as provided in Section 20(a) hereof, it shall deliver to the Pledgee a certificate signed by a principal executive officer of the Pledgor stating that the release of the respective Collateral is permitted pursuant to such Section 20(a). 21.

The Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints Corporation Service Company the "Process Agent"), with an office on the date hereof at 1177 Avenue of the Americas, 17th Floor, New York, NY 10036, as its agent to receive on its behalf and on behalf of its property, service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process that may be served in any such action or proceeding. Service upon the Process Agent shall be deemed to be personal service on the Pledgor and shall be legal 16
and binding upon the Pledgor for all purposes notwithstanding any failure to mail copies of such (b) legal process to the Pledgor, or any failure on the part of the Pledgor to receive the same. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Pledgee to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law or any right of the Pledgee to bring legal action or proceedings in any other competent jurisdiction. The Pledgor further agrees that the aforesaid courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any claim or counterclaim of the Pledgor based upon the assertion that the rate of interest charged in respect of any of the Secured Obligations under any Financing Document is usurious. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Pledgor further irrevocably agrees to the service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Pledgor at the address referenced in Section 21. (c) The Pledgor agrees that it will at all times continuously maintain an agent to receive service of process in the State of New York on behalf of itself and its properties, and, in the event that for any reason the agent mentioned above shall not serve as agent for the Pledgor to receive service of process in the State of New York on its behalf, the Pledgor shall promptly appoint a successor satisfactory to the Pledgee so to serve, advise the Pledgee thereof, and deliver to the Pledgee evidence in writing of the successor agent's acceptance of such appointment. The foregoing provisions constitute, among other things, a special arrangement for service among the parties to this Agreement for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. (S) 1608. (d) To the extent the Pledgor may, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, be entitled under any applicable Law to require or claim that the Pledgee post security for costs or take similar action, the Pledgor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to claim the benefit of such entitlement. 25. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY RELATING HERETO OR THERETO.

3.4 Subsequently Acquired Collateral. If the Pledgor shall acquire (by purchase, dividend or similar distribution or otherwise) any additional Collateral at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, such Collateral shall automatically (and without any further action being required to be taken) be subject to the pledge and security interests created pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof and, furthermore, the Pledgor will promptly thereafter take (or cause to be taken) all action with respect to such Collateral in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.3 hereof, and will promptly thereafter deliver to the Pledgee (i) a certificate executed by a principal executive officer of the Pledgor describing such Collateral and certifying that the same has been duly pledged in favor of the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) hereunder and (ii) supplements to Annexes A and B hereto as are reasonably necessary to cause such annexes to be complete and accurate at such time. 3.5 Transfer Taxes.

All dividends, distributions or other payments which are received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6 and Section 7 hereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Pledgee, shall be segregated from other property or funds of the Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). 7. REMEDIES IN CASE OF DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT. Subject to the Credit Agreement, if there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this Agreement, any other Financing Document or by law) for the protection and enforcement of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction and also shall be entitled, without limitation, to exercise the following rights: (i) to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral; (ii) to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or nominees; (iii) to vote all or any part of the Collateral (whether or not transferred into the name of the Pledgee) and give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the Collateral and otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof (the Pledgor hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee the proxy
and attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor, with full power of substitution to do so) and to exercise any and all of the rights or powers of the Pledgor in its capacity as a stockholder of the Issuer; (iv) at any time and from time to time to sell, assign and deliver, or grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale, without demand of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of the time or place of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem or otherwise (all of which are hereby waived by the Pledgor to the extent permitted by applicable Law), for cash, on credit or for other property, for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion may determine, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any such sale of Collateral regardless of whether any notice of sale has theretofore been given. The Pledgor hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder (other than the right to pay the Secured Obligations in full), and all rights, if any, of marshalling the Collateral and any other security for the Secured Obligations or otherwise. At any such sale, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Pledgee may bid for and purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption. The Pledgee shall not be liable for failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay in so doing nor shall any of them be under any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto; and (v) to set-off any and all Collateral against any and all Secured Obligations and to apply such Collateral to the payment of any and all Secured Obligations. If, pursuant to applicable Law, prior notice of any of the foregoing actions is required to be given to the Pledgee, the Pledgee hereby acknowledges that the minimum time required by such applicable Law, or if no minimum is specified, ten (10) days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period. 8. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE. Each and every right, power and remedy of the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or in any other Financing Document, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or any other Financing Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. All monies collected by the Pledgee upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with all other monies received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied at the written instruction of the Majority Tranche A Lenders (or, after the Transition Date, the Majority Tranche B Lenders) for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations in the order provided in the Credit Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. 10. PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt given by the Pledgee or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof. 11. [OMITTED] 12. CERTAIN LIMITATIONS (a) The Pledgee shall not be obligated to perform or discharge any obligation of the Pledgor as a result of the pledge hereby effected. (b) The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time or in any event obligate the Pledgee to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Collateral. 13. FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER-OF-ATTORNEY. (a) At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Pledgee, and at the sole expense of the Pledgor, the Pledgor will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments and documents and take such further action as the Pledgee reasonably may deem appropriate in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral and in order for the Pledgee to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted, including, without limitation, the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction and the filing of any other equivalent or similar statement or document under any other applicable Law with any other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to the security interests granted hereby. The Pledgor also hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file any such financing or continuation statement without the signature of the Pledgor to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or instrument shall be immediately delivered to the Pledgee and pledged to the Pledgee hereunder, duly endorsed, to the extent necessary, to the Pledgee. The Pledgor shall not change its name, identity, principal place of business or place of organization in any manner unless the Pledgor shall have given the Pledgee at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice thereof and shall have taken, at the Pledgor's sole expense, all
action necessary or reasonably requested by the Pledgee in order to continue the perfection and priority of the security interests in the Collateral intended to be created by this Agreement.

government requirements, provided, that the Pledgee shall furnish to the Pledgor such information regarding the Pledgee as the Pledgor may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance.

(b) In consideration of the extension by the Tranche A Lenders of the maturity date of the Tranche A Loan under Section 2.9(b) of the Credit Agreement and as a condition to such extension of the maturity date thereunder, effective on each Extension Date and only if such Extension Date occurs, LLC hereby grants to the Holders (to be allocated among the Holders as described in the last paragraph of this Section 2.01(b)), an unconditional, irrevocable option (collectively, the "Additional Option") to purchase from LLC a percentage of the total common equity of the Company outstanding on such Extension Date, computed on a Fully Diluted Basis, as determined pursuant to Section 4.02(b) of this Agreement, which Additional Option may be exercised as provided in Article IV hereof; provided that to the extent that such percentage exceeds one percent (1.0%) for each Additional Option (such excess only, the "Excess Additional Option Percentage"), then, at the Borrower's option, (i) the Holders may receive such Additional Option with respect to the Excess Additional Option Percentage, or (ii) the Borrower may pay on such Extension Date to such Holders an amount equal to the Put Option Purchase Price with respect to such Excess Additional Option Percentage; provided, further, that the Borrower shall exercise its option referred to in the foregoing proviso equally and on a non-discriminatory basis with respect to all Holders entitled to a portion of such Excess Additional Option Percentage.

ARTICLE VIII Registration, Drag-Along, Tag-Along and Preemptive Rights SECTION 8.01. Drag-Along. If, prior to the closing date of the IPO, LLC or the Company shall propose to sell or convey 75% or more of its shares of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities (calculated on an as-converted basis), or any interest therein, to an Independent Third Party (including, without limitation, a sale of the Company by merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of its assets, sale of all of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and Convertible Securities or otherwise) (the "Approved Sale"), LLC or the Company shall give prompt written notice (the "Sale Notice") to the Holders setting forth the terms and conditions of the proposed transfer, including the identity of the Independent Third Party, the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities to be transferred, the per share price to be paid for the shares of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities to be transferred and the type and nature of the consideration to be received therefor. By so indicating in the Sale Notice, LLC shall be entitled to require the Holders to sell to the Independent Third Party in the same transaction their portion of the Option and Option Shares, on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Sale Notice; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.01 shall not apply to the sale or conveyance of any Common Stock of the Company pledged by LLC pursuant to the terms of the Stock Pledge Agreement until such time as such Common Stock is no longer pledged thereunder. Without limitation as to the foregoing, the Holders will consent to and raise no objections against the Approved Sale. If the Approved Sale is structured as a merger or consolidation, each Holder shall waive any dissenters rights, appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with such merger or consolidation. The Holders will take all necessary and desirable actions in connection with the consummation of any Approved Sale. For purposes of this Section 8.01, an "Independent Third Party" is any Person who, prior to such sale, does not own in excess of 5% of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities in the aggregate on a Fully Diluted Basis, who is not controlling, controlled by or under common control with any such 5% owner of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities in the aggregate and who is not the

Each Holder, by written notice to LLC delivered within 10 days after the date of such Tag-Along Notice, shall be entitled to require LLC to include in the proposed sale to the Independent Third Party in the same transaction all of its Option and Option Shares (or, if LLC is selling less than all of the Company's Common Stock it owns, a percentage of each such Holder's Option and Option Shares equivalent to the percentage of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities and rights to acquire shares of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Securities to be sold by LLC or the Company), on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Tag-Along Notice; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.02 shall not apply to the sale or conveyance of any Common Stock of the Company pledged by LLC pursuant to the terms of the Stock Pledge Agreement until such time as such Common Stock is no longer pledged thereunder. All fractional shares resulting from the calculation contained in the prior sentence will be rounded to the nearest whole share. LLC shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the agreement of the prospective transferee(s) to the participation of the Holders in any contemplated transfer and LLC shall not transfer any of its shares to the prospective transferee(s) if the prospective transferee(s) declines to allow participation of the Holders. Following their compliance with the foregoing, LLC and any Holders who have elected to participate in the contemplated transfer may, within 90 days after the expiration of the 10-day period referenced above, transfer all of the shares specified in the Tag-Along Notice to the transferee(s) specified in the Tag-Along Notice at a price not less than the price per share specified in the Tag-Along Notice and on other terms no less favorable to the transferors in any material respect than the terms specified in the Tag-Along Notice. SECTION 8.03. Expenses of Sale. As between the Holders and the Company, the Company will pay the costs of any sale of the Option and Option Shares pursuant to a sale pursuant to Section 8.01 or 8.02 of this Agreement to the extent that such costs are incurred for the benefit of all holders of Common Stock and rights to acquire Common Stock and are not otherwise paid by the acquiring party. Costs incurred by the Holders on their own behalf will not be considered costs of the transaction hereunder. ARTICLE IX Registration Rights SECTION 9.01. Piggy-Back and Shelf Registration Rights. (a) If the Company at any time in connection with, or after the consummation of, the IPO proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to any Underwritten Offering by the
22 Company for its own account or for the account of holders of any Common Stock, Convertible Securities or Common Stock Equivalent to be offered for cash (other than on Form S-4 or S-8) then the Company shall in each case give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders at least twenty (20) days before the anticipated filing date, and such notice shall offer (a "Piggy-Back Registration Offer") such Holders the opportunity to include all of the Registrable Securities held by them in such registration statement (a "Piggy-Back Registration"). In such event (x) the right of any Holder to registration pursuant to this Section 9.01(a) may be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and of the inclusion such Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein and (y) in cases initially involving the registration for sale of securities for the account of a holder or holders exercising rights similar to those of the Holders set forth in Section 9.02 of this Agreement, securities shall be registered in such offering in the order of priority set forth in Section 9.02 hereof. If any such Holder desires to have Registrable Securities registered and included in such Underwritten Offering under this Section 9.01(a) such Holder shall so notify the Company in writing within ten (10) days after the receipt by such Holder of the written notice provided for in the preceding sentence (which notification shall set forth the amount of Registrable Securities for which registration is requested), and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to be registered under the Securities Act to the extent requisite to permit the disposition in such Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering, as selected by the Company, shall advise the Company in writing that in its or their opinion the total amount or kind of securities that the Holders, the Company and any other Persons or entities intend to include in such offering exceeds the amount that can be sold in such offering without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered by the Company, the Company shall be required to include in such registration only the amount of Registrable Securities and securities of other persons or entities, if any, that the managing underwriter or underwriters determine, in its or their sole discretion, can be sold without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered. In such event, in cases initially involving the registration for sale of securities for the Company's own account, securities shall be registered in such offering in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities which the Company proposes to register, (ii) second, the securities which may have been requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this Agreement (pro rata based on the amount of securities sought to be registered by such Persons) and (iii) third, the securities of other Persons entitled to exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments of the Company. (b) At any time prior to the date of printing preliminary prospectuses in connection with an Underwritten Offering under Section 9.01(a) hereof, a Holder that previously requested Piggy-Back Registration thereof may withdraw all or part of its Registrable Securities from such offering by providing notice to such effect to the Company. (c) (i) Within forty-five (45) days after delivery of a written notice by Holders of more than 50% of the Registrable Securities which notice may be delivered at any time after the date on which the Company becomes eligible to prepare and file a shelf registration statement (the "Shelf Registration") on Form S-3 (or such successor form to Form S-3 as the Company may at the time be eligible to use), the Company shall file a registration statement for the registration of securities under the Securities Act providing for the sale from time to time by the Holders of all of their Registrable Securities then outstanding, and all
23 Registrable Securities issuable thereafter. The Company may include in the Shelf Registration shares of Common Stock sold for the account of the Company, but no other person. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed by all parties hereto that a request for a Shelf Registration pursuant to this Section 9.01(c) shall not constitute a Demand for a Demand Registration and for all purposes of this Agreement, a Shelf Registration shall not be counted in the tabulation of the number of Demand Registrations under Section 9.02 hereof. (ii) The registration rights of the Holders pursuant to this Section 9.01(c) and the ability to offer and sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration are subject to the following conditions and limitations, and each of the Holders agrees with the Company that (i) if the Company determines in its good faith judgment, at any time prior to or during the effectiveness of the filing of a Shelf Registration pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(ii), that the Company possesses material non-public information relating to a pending or imminent event or announcement or is engaged in confidential negotiations or other confidential business activities (including, but not limited to, information related to any pending or proposed consolidation, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction and any pending discussions related thereto), upon written notice of such determination by the Company delivered to the Holders, the rights of each of the Holders to publicly offer, publicly sell or publicly distribute any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration or to require the Company to take action with respect to the registration or sale of any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration (including any action contemplated by Section 9.04 hereof) will be suspended until the date upon which the Company notifies the Holders in writing that suspension of such rights for the grounds set forth in this Section 9.01(c)(ii) is no longer necessary; provided, however, the Company shall not be permitted to suspend the rights of the Holders pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(ii) for more than an aggregate of ninety (90) days within any twelve-month period; provided, further, that no one suspension shall last more than sixty (60) days. SECTION 9.02. Demand Registration. (a) Demand Registration Rights. At any time and from time to time after the consummation of the IPO, the Majority Holders may make a written request to the Company (each a "Demand") for registration with the SEC under and in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities (each a "Demand Registration"). Within ten (10) days after receipt of a Demand, the Company will send to all of the other Holders written notice (the "Notice") of such Demand and, subject to the conditions set forth in the following paragraph, the Company will include in the Demand Registration all Registrable Securities of such other Holders with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within ten (10) days after receipt by the applicable Holder of the Notice. Any Demand made pursuant to this Section 9.02(a) shall specify the aggregate amount of the Registrable Securities to be registered and shall also specify the intended methods of disposition thereof. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to be registered under the Securities Act to the extent requisite to permit the
24 disposition in such Demand Registration; provided, however, that if the managing underwriter or underwriters of such offering, as selected by the Company, shall advise the Company in writing that in its or their opinion the total amount or kind of securities that the Holders, the Company and any other Persons or entities intend to include in such offering exceeds the amount that can be sold in such offering without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered by the Holders, the Company shall be required to include in such registration only the amount of Registrable Securities and securities of the Company and such other persons or entities, if any, that the managing underwriter or underwriters determine, in its or their sole discretion, can be sold without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered. In such event, securities shall be registered in such offering in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities which have been requested to be included in such registration pursuant to this Section 9.02(a) and pursuant to "piggy back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments of the Company (pro rata based on the amount of the securities sought to be registered by the Holders and such other persons exercising "piggy back" registration rights), and (ii) second, any securities which the Company proposes to register. (b) Effective Registration and Expenses. The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days), after any such Demand a registration statement in respect of the Demand Registration (a "Demand Registration Statement"). The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to have such Demand Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after such filing, but in any event, no later than ninety (90) days after filing of the registration statement. The Company agrees, if necessary, to supplement or amend any Demand Registration Statement, as required by the registration form utilized by the Company or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or as reasonably requested (which request shall result in the filing of a supplement or amendment subject to approval thereof by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) by the Holders included in the Demand Registration Statement, and the Company agrees to furnish to the Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used and/or filed with the SEC. (c) Number of Demand Registrations. The Holders shall be entitled to four (4) Demand Registrations. The Company shall not be deemed to have effected a Demand Registration (i) unless and until the Demand Registration Statement is declared effective and remains effective for a period of at least one hundred and eighty (180) days or until all the securities registered pursuant thereto have been sold, whichever is the first to occur; (ii) if, after the Registration Statement has become effective, it is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the Holders, unless all stop orders, injunctions and orders shall have been lifted or rescinded, all requirements shall have been satisfied or waived, and the registration statement has thereafter become effective again; (iii) if the customary conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of any Holder; or (iv) if the Holders initiating the Demand Registration were unable to sell all of the securities they requested be included in such Demand Registration.
25 (d) Selection of Underwriters and Counsel. The Company shall select the lead managing underwriter in connection with a Demand Registration, subject to the approval of the Holders initiating the Demand Registration, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. SECTION 9.03. Hold-Back Agreements; Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders. The registration rights of the Holders pursuant to this Agreement and the ability to offer and sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement are subject to the following conditions and limitations, and each of the Holders agrees with the Company that: (i) If the Company determines in its good faith judgment, at any time prior to the filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 9.02 hereof, that the Company possesses material non-public information relating to a pending or imminent event or announcement or is engaged in confidential negotiations or other confidential business activities (including, but not limited to, information related to any pending or proposed consolidation, merger, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction and any pending discussions related thereto), upon written notice of such determination by the Company delivered prior to the filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 9.02 hereof, the rights of each of the Holders to publicly offer, publicly sell or publicly distribute any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement or to require the Company to take action with respect to the registration or sale of any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement (including any action contemplated by Section 9.04 hereof) will be suspended until the date upon which the Company notifies the Holders in writing that suspension of such rights for the grounds set forth in this Section 9.03 is no longer necessary; provided, however, the Company shall not be permitted to suspend the rights of the Holders pursuant to this Section 9.03(i) for more than an aggregate of ninety (90) days within any twelve-month period; provided, further, that no one suspension shall last more than sixty (60) days. If the Company shall so postpone the filing of a Demand Registration Statement, the Majority Holders shall have the right to withdraw the request for registration by giving the Company written notice within twenty (20) days after receipt of the notice of postponement (and, in the event of such withdrawal, such request shall not be counted as the one Demand Registration to which the Holders are entitled pursuant to Section 9.02(c) hereof). (ii) In the case of the registration of any underwritten primary offering of capital stock of the Company, each Holder agrees, in connection with such Underwritten Offering, to enter into an underwriting agreement containing such terms and covenants customary for such Underwritten Offerings, including, but not limited to, representations of such Holders in accordance with Section 9.04 of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Section 9.03 shall require any Holder to provide any indemnification or contribution obligations inconsistent with Section 9.06 hereof.

30 thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement effective), in each case on the effective date of such Registration Statement or post-effective amendment, or the date of such Prospectus, including any preliminary prospectus, or supplement, (ii) any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of either of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, or any state securities law, and will reimburse, as incurred, each such indemnified party for any reasonable legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in connection with any such Losses or action or threatened action in respect thereof; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, Prospectus, form of prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use therein. (b) Indemnification by a Holder. In connection with a Registration Statement in which a Holder is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information as is required by law to be disclosed by such seller in a Registration Statement and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, agents and employees, each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents and employees of such controlling persons, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against all Losses arising solely out of or based solely upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, or arising solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company expressly for use therein. In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party promptly shall so notify the person from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure to give notice shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.
31 Any such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly (but in any event, no later than 10 days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of its failure to do so) to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such action, claim or proceeding; or (3) the named parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall (x) reasonably conclude that one or more legal defenses are available to it that are not available to the Indemnified Party or (y) have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party), it being understood, however, that, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties (other than counsel for which the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay under clause (1) above), which firm shall be designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party and is entitled to indemnity hereunder unless such settlement relates solely to the payment of money damages and (x) includes a full unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liabilities on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party. All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) for which the indemnifying party is responsible pursuant to this Section 9.06(c) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten Business Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided that the Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). (d) Contribution. If indemnification under Section 9.06(a) or 9.06(b) hereof is unavailable or insufficient to cover losses of an Indemnified Party, then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in
32 connection with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.06(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or Proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9.06(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.06(d), an Indemnifying Party that is a Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such Indemnifying Party from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such Indemnifying Party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. ARTICLE X Miscellaneous SECTION 10.01. SEC Reports and other Financial Information. LLC shall provide the Holders, within fifteen (15) days after the Company files same with the SEC, copies of the Company's annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution directly to the Senior Obligees; and (iii) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, after any of the events described in clauses (a) through (d) of this Section 2.2, in the event that any payment or distribution of assets of any Credit Party of any kind or character (in cash, property or securities (other than the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account and any proceeds thereof, Reorganization Securities and the pay-in-kind interest due and payable from time to time under Section 2.5(g) of the Credit Agreement) or by set-off or otherwise), shall be received by any Junior Obligee, directly or indirectly, whether on account of any principal, interest, premium or other amount on or in respect of the Junior Obligations or as a redemption, retirement, purchase, defeasance, prepayment or acquisition of any Junior Obligations or otherwise, before all Senior Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full in cash, such payment or distribution shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be immediately paid over to, the Initial Tranche A Lender, for application to payment of all Senior Obligations, to the extent necessary to indefeasibly pay in full in cash all Senior Obligations (including, without limitation, all amounts (including, without limitation, any prepayments) in respect of Senior Obligations, whether due in the ordinary course or by reason of acceleration) remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution directly to the Senior Obligees. 2.3 Authorization of the Initial Tranche A Lender to File Claims, etc. Subject to the rights of the Junior Obligees provided in Section 2.5, in the event that (i) a bankruptcy proceeding shall be commenced by or against the Borrower and (ii) on or before the date which is ten Business Days before the last date upon which the Junior Obligees are required to file a proof of claim in such bankruptcy proceeding any Junior Obligee (the claims of which have not been scheduled by the Borrower in its filing as undisputed) does not file a proof of claim in respect of the Junior Obligations owing to such Junior Obligee (any Junior Obligee, the claims of which have not been scheduled by the Borrower in its filing as undisputed, and which has failed to so file such proof of claim, a "Defaulting Junior Obligee"), then, in such event, such Defaulting Junior Obligee hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers (without imposing any obligation on) the Initial Tranche A Lender under the circumstances set forth in Section 2.2 to file such proof of claim in respect of the Junior Obligations owing to such Defaulting Junior Obligee. The proceeds of all such claims shall be applied as required by the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph to the contrary, (i) except during the Payment Blockage Period, the Company may continue to make payment of interest on any Junior Obligation when due and payable pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (ii) whether or not a Payment Blockage Period is then in effect, the Company may (x) continue to make payment of interest, but solely from proceeds of the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account, on any Junior Obligations when due and payable pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (y) continue to make payment of pay-in-kind interest when due and payable pursuant to the Credit Agreement and (z) make payments to the Junior Obligees under Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement if any Tranche A Lender shall not have accepted the Change of Control Offer to Repay. As used herein, "Payment Blockage Period" shall mean the period commencing the date the Initial Tranche A Lender has delivered a Default Notice to the Administrative Agent and during which period payments in respect of the Junior Obligations are not permitted to be retained by the Junior Obligees pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement; provided that (i) any Payment Blockage Period arising from an Event of Default (other than a payment or bankruptcy Event of Default) by the Company under Section 8 of the Credit Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the date on which such Event of Default is cured or waived in accordance with the Credit Agreement and (B) the date which is 179 days after the date of the receipt by the Administrative Agent of the Default Notice with respect thereto, (ii) no more than one Default Notice may be delivered to initiate a Payment Blockage Period during any consecutive 365-day period, (iii) the Initial Tranche A Lender agrees not to deliver a Default Notice to block payment of amounts payable by the Company to the Junior Obligees under Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement if any Tranche A Lender shall not have accepted the Change of Control Offer to Repay and (iv) any Payment Blockage Period arising from a payment Event of Default shall terminate on the date on which such Event of Default is cured or waived by the Tranche A Lenders in accordance with the Credit Agreement. (c) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 2.4(a), any payment prohibited by said Section shall be received by any Junior Obligee, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over to, the Initial Tranche A Lender, for application pursuant to the provisions of the Credit Agreement and this Agreement. Any payment or distribution that is so paid over to the Initial Tranche A Lender and applied to the Senior Obligations shall not be deemed to have been a payment on account of, and shall not reduce the amount of, the Junior Obligations. -6-
2.5 Limitation on Remedies. (a)(I) So long as any Senior Obligation shall remain outstanding or during any Payment Blockage Period, except as expressly permitted by and subject to the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.5(a)(II) below), the Junior Obligees shall have no right to (i) except to the extent not prohibited by clause (II) of this Section 2.5(a), commence, prosecute or participate in any administrative, legal or equitable action against any of the Credit Parties relating to any Junior Obligations (it being understood that the holders of the Junior Obligations may participate in any such action in which the Tranche A Lender or its representative is participating (and not commenced by the holders of the Junior Obligations in such capacity) to the extent necessary to maintain their claims to, and to preserve their rights in respect of, the Junior Obligations), (ii) commence or join in the commencement of a proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or other similar law in its capacity as a holder of Junior Obligations (it being understood that the holders of the Junior Obligations may participate in any such proceeding not commenced by the holders of the Junior Obligations in such capacity to the extent necessary to maintain their claims to, and to preserve their rights in respect of, the Junior Obligations), or (iii) direct the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to do any of the foregoing and (II) during any Payment Blockage Period, except as expressly permitted by and subject to the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.5(c) below), the Junior Obligees shall have no right to (i) take any action or institute any proceedings to collect or enforce the payment of any of the Junior Obligations (other than the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account and any proceeds thereof), (ii) take any action under the Financing Documents or otherwise to foreclose or sell or otherwise realize upon any Collateral (other than the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account and any proceeds thereof) or enforce any of the Financing Documents or to exercise any right, remedy or power in respect of the Junior Obligations under any of the Financing Documents or otherwise available to it under applicable law, or (iii) direct the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to do any of the foregoing. (b) If any Junior Obligee, in violation of the provisions herein set forth, shall commence, prosecute or participate in any suit, action, case or proceeding against any Credit Party, any Senior Obligee may at the expense of the Junior Obligees, intervene and interpose as a defense or plea the provisions set forth herein, and such Senior Obligee shall, in any event, be entitled to restrain the enforcement of the payment provisions of the Junior Obligations in its own name in the same suit, action, case or proceeding or in any independent suit, action, case or proceeding. (c) In the event of the occurrence and continuance of a Tranche B Event of Default, the Junior Obligees, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall not exercise any of their remedies against any Credit Party or the Collateral under the Financing Documents unless the Junior Obligees shall have first delivered to the Senior Obligees a notice of such Tranche B Event of Default together with reasonable detail describing the nature of such Tranche B Event of Default and the Senior Obligees shall have a period of 180 days after the receipt of such notice to, at its option, elect to cure such Tranche B Event of Default. After the expiration of such 180 day period, if the Tranche B Event of Default shall not have been cured or waived in accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Junior Obligees may (i) exercise their rights and remedies under the Financing Documents (other than to foreclose on the Collateral) and/or (ii) foreclose on the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents; provided that the Junior Obligees may not foreclose on any Collateral unless either (x) the Junior Obligees shall have delivered -7-
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Obligees of binding written commitment(s) from creditworthy purchaser(s) committing to purchase the Collateral in cash or equivalent consideration, subject only to customary closing conditions precedent, such that the net proceeds of the foreclosure of the Collateral shall be sufficient to indefeasibly pay and satisfy the Senior Obligations in full or (y) the Senior Obligees shall have consented thereto in writing. Upon satisfaction of either of the conditions set forth in Section 2.5(c)(iii), the Senior Obligees agree to direct the Collateral Agent to follow the instructions of the Tranche B Lenders with respect to the exercise of the rights and remedies under the Financing Documents to foreclose on the Collateral, subject to the other terms of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, including, without limitation, the order of priority in the application of proceeds with respect thereto as set forth herein or therein. (d) If the Senior Obligees shall elect to cure any Tranche B Event of Default as contemplated in Section 2.5(c) above, the Senior Obligees shall be subrogated to the rights of the Junior Obligees to receive payments or distribution of assets of the Credit Parties made on the Junior Obligations so satisfied or to bring any claim or action against the Credit Parties with respect thereto. (e) In the event that (i) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Credit Agreement and (ii) the Senior Obligee has not delivered a Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee under, and in each case as defined in, the Convertible Notes Indenture, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Junior Obligee or the Administrative Agent from delivering such a Payment Blockage Notice. 2.6 Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair, as among the Credit Parties, the Senior Obligees, and the Junior Obligees, the obligations of the Credit Parties, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the Senior Obligees and the Junior Obligees, as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Financing Documents, the principal of, interest on and other amounts due with respect to the Senior Obligations and the Junior Obligations, or affect the relative rights of the Senior Obligees and the Junior Obligees vis-a-vis other creditors of the Credit Parties. 2.7 No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.

(b) The obligations of the Junior Obligees under these subordination provisions shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment in respect of any Senior Obligation, or any other payment to any holder of any Senior Obligation in its capacity as such, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the holder of such Senior Obligation upon the occurrence of any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or other similar law, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Credit Party or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 2.8 Legend on Tranche B Notes and Warrants.

(b) Subject to the indefeasible payment in full of the Senior Obligations in cash pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof, the Junior Obligees shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the Senior Obligees pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement to the rights of the Senior Obligees to receive payments or distributions applicable to the Senior Obligations until the Junior Obligations shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the Senior Obligees of any cash, property or securities to which the Junior Obligees would be entitled except for the provisions of this Agreement, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, to or for the benefit of the holders of Senior Obligations, shall, as between the Borrower, its creditors other than the Senior Obligees, and the Junior Obligees, be deemed to be a payment by the Borrower to or on account of the Senior Obligations; and no payments or distributions of cash, property or securities to or for the benefit of the Junior Obligees pursuant to the subrogation provisions of this Agreement, which would otherwise have been paid to the Senior Obligees shall be deemed to be a payment by the Borrower to or for the account of the Senior Obligees.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "Collateral Agent," in this Agreement with reference to the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a relationship between independent contracting parties. -10-
3.2 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Financing Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders or any other Person for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Covered Party or any Affiliate of any Covered Party, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Financing Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or for the value of or title to any Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or for any failure of any Covered Party or any other party to any Financing Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.

The Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Collateral -11-
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to the Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". If the Collateral Agent receives any such notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, it shall give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Collateral Agent upon demand as provided above of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Collateral Agent or Agent Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Covered Parties within 90 days of the Collateral Agent's request to the Borrower for payment and without limiting the obligation of the Covered Parties to do so) in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, pro rata in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by such Lenders (as determined by the Administrative Agent). The provisions of this section shall survive termination of this Agreement or earlier resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to set off from any Collateral or proceeds thereof any amounts due and owing to it pursuant to this Section 3.5 solely to the extent such amounts are not paid by any Covered Party or the Lenders as provided herein and in the Financing Documents and such amounts remain unpaid by the Lenders for a period of thirty days after demand therefor. 3.6 Successor Collateral Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor as provided below, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Collateral Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Waiver Lenders upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Waiver Lenders shall have the right to -12-
appoint a successor to the Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed by the Required Waiver Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Collateral Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the giving of any notice of removal of such Collateral Agent, then the resigning Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent being removed, as the case may be, may at the Borrower's expense, appoint a successor to such Collateral Agent. If the Collateral Agent shall resign or be removed pursuant to the foregoing provisions, upon the acceptance of appointment by a successor Collateral Agent hereunder, the former Collateral Agent shall deliver all Collateral then in its possession to the successor Collateral Agent. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as a successor Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such resigning or removed Collateral Agent, and such resigning Collateral Agent or removed Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents. 3.7 Miscellaneous. (a) None of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Financing Document shall require the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured to it. (b) The Collateral Agent may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder or under any Security Document either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and shall not be responsible for any willful misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed. (c) Any corporation into which the Collateral Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the Collateral Agent shall be the successor of the Collateral Agent hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. SECTION 4. MISCELLANEOUS. 4.1 Severability.

In the alternative, each Holder may exercise its right to receive Warrant Shares on a net basis (a "Cashless Exercise"), such that, without the exchange of any funds, the holder receives that number of Warrant Shares otherwise issuable (or payable) upon exercise of the Warrants less that number of Warrant Shares having an aggregate Current Market Price at the time of exercise equal to the aggregate Exercise Price that would otherwise have been paid by the Holder of the Warrant Shares. If the Warrants are not exercised prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Expiration Date, they shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time. No adjustments as to Dividends will be made upon exercise of the Warrants. The Holders will only be able to exercise their Warrants (i) by means of a cashless exercise or (ii) if any registration statement under the Securities Act relating to the Warrant Shares is effective or the exercise of such Warrants is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such securities are qualified for sale or exempt from qualification under the applicable securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which such Holders reside. No Holder may exercise any Warrant to the extent that, immediately following such exercise and upon receipt of any Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, such Holder would either (i) become or be included in any 13D Person that is the single largest holder of voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise become the single largest holder of the Common Stock) (the "Shareholder Limitation"), or (ii) beneficially own (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or be included in any 13D Person that beneficially owns in excess of 4.9% of the voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise beneficially own in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock) (the "4.9% Limitation") after, in either case, giving effect to such exercise (the Shareholder Limitation and the 4.9% Limitation are collectively referred to herein as the "Exercise
12 Limitations"). The determinations of the number of shares that (i) constitute 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock or voting power and (ii) are held by the largest holder will be made in reliance upon the information contained in publicly available filings made with the SEC unless the Company is aware that such information is incorrect and has made the correct information public, to the extent material, and disclosed such information to the Holders at the time of any such proposed exercise. In order to facilitate compliance with the foregoing, each Holder will be required to make a representation that it and its affiliates will comply with the Exercise Limitations immediately after the exercise of any Warrant and receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise. Notwithstanding the Exercise Limitation, however, a Holder may exercise any Warrant that would otherwise cause such Holder to hold Warrant Shares in excess of the Exercise Limitations if, as to such excess number of Warrant Shares (the "Excess Shares"), such Holder (i) irrevocably covenants to the Company to sell such Excess Shares within 10 days after the date of exercise and (ii) confirms that it has, on or prior to such exercise date, entered into a binding arrangement to sell the Excess Shares within 10 days after such exercise date either (a) in a regular way transaction on a national securities exchange (or the principal market where shares of Common Stock are then traded) or (b) to one or more persons that are not "affiliates" (used herein as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act) of such Holder ("Third Parties"), each of whom represents for the benefit of the Company that, upon purchase of the applicable Excess Shares, such Third Party, together with its affiliates, will not be the beneficial owner of a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exercise Limitations. In addition, such Holder shall agree to vote the applicable Excess Shares only in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company or any Third Party that has agreed to purchase such shares, if any record date for a vote of the Common Stock is established for any day between the exercise date and the consummation of the sale of the applicable Excess Shares. The Exercise Limitations will cease to have any force and effect upon consummation of the Utility Spin-Off, if, on the date that is 14 days after delivery to the Company of a request by the Required Holders to such effect (which request may be given no more than once during any 180-day period), the Company shall not have delivered a certificate to the Holders stating that the removal of the Exercise Limitations would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, not be consistent with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements. SECTION 4.02. Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant Shares Issuable. The number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant (the "Warrant Number") is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this Section 4.02; provided that no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 4.02 which shall have the effect of decreasing the Warrant Number (except pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(3)) or increasing the Exercise Price (except pursuant to Section 4.02(a)(3)). For purposes of this Section 4.02, "Common Stock" means shares now or hereafter authorized of any class of common stock of the Company and any other stock of the Company, however designated, that has the right (subject to any prior rights of any class or series of preferred stock) to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Company without limit as to per share amount. (a) Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock.
13 If the Company: (1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its Common Stock; (2) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares; (3) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number; (4) makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock other than Common Stock; or (5) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its capital stock, then Warrant Number immediately prior to such action shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised shall receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the Company which such Holder would have owned immediately following such action if such Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such action. The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. If after an adjustment a Holder upon exercise of a Warrant may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company, the Company shall reasonably determine the allocation of the adjusted Exercise Price between the classes of capital stock. After such allocation, the exercise privilege and the number of shares of each such class of capital stock shall thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Section 4.02. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur. (b) Adjustment for Rights Issue. If the Company distributes any rights, warrants or options to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date mentioned below to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share on that record date, the Warrant Number shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: O + A ----- N' = N x O + A x P ------- M where:
14 N' = the adjusted Warrant Number. N = the current Warrant Number. O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date. A = the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered. P = the purchase price per share of the additional shares. M = the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date. The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights, warrants or options are issued and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options. If at the end of the period during which such rights, warrants or options are exercisable, not all rights, warrants or options shall have been exercised, the Warrant Number shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been if "A" in the above formula had been the number of shares actually issued. (c) Adjustment for Other Distributions. Except with respect to any distribution provided for in Section 4.02(d), if the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets (other than Cash Dividends) or debt securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase debt securities, assets (other than Cash Dividends) or other securities of the Company, the Warrant Number shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula: M N' = N x --------- M - F where: N' = the adjusted Warrant Number. N = the current Warrant Number. M = the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date mentioned below. F = the fair market value on the record date of the assets, securities, rights or warrants distributable to one share of Common Stock. The Board of the Company shall reasonably and in good faith determine the fair market value.3 The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
15 This subsection (c) does not apply to rights, warrants or options referred to in subsection (b) of this Section 4.02 or any assets distributed pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section 4.02. If any adjustment is made pursuant to this subsection (c) as a result of the issuance of rights, warrants or options and at the end of the period during which any such rights, warrants or options are exercisable, not all such rights, warrants or options shall have been exercised, the Warrants shall be immediately readjusted as if "F" in the above formula was the fair market value on the record date of the indebtedness or assets actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, warrants or options divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection (c), if "M - - F" in the above formula is less than $1.00 (or is a negative number) then in lieu of the adjustment otherwise required by this subsection (c), the Company shall distribute to each Holder of a Warrant, the evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, warrants or options (or the proceeds thereof) which would have been distributed to such Holder had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such distribution. (d) Adjustments for Spin-Offs. Upon consummation of any distribution consisting of shares of Capital Stock of, or similar equity interests in, one or more of the Company's Subsidiaries (a "Spin-Off"), including, without limitation, the consummation of the Utility Spin-Off or a Spin-Off of NEG, Inc., the Warrant Number shall be adjusted in accordance with the following formula: P + U N' = N x ------- P Where: N' = the adjusted Warrant Number. N = the then current Warrant Number. P = the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Common Stock of the reorganized Company over the Trading Period. U = the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Common Stock of the Subsidiary which was subject to the Spin-Off over the Trading Period. Trading Period = the 20 consecutive trading days commencing on and including the 20th day of trading of the Common Stock after the effectiveness of such Spin-Off. (1) The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such Spin-Off is made and shall become effective immediately after such Spin-Off. (e) Other Adjustments. The Warrant Shares are subject to further adjustment in the manner set forth in Section 4.09 and Section 3 of the Registration Rights Agreement. (f) When De Minimis Adjustment May Be Deferred. No adjustment in the Warrant Number need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at
16 least 1% in the Warrant Number. Any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 4.02 shall be made to the nearest 1/1000/th/ cent or to the nearest 1/10 millionth of a share, as the case may be. (g) When No Adjustment Required. No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in subsections (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 4.02 if the Holders are to participate, without requiring the Warrants to be exercised, in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of the Company reasonably determine to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. To the extent the Warrants become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the amount of cash into which the Warrants are exercisable. Interest will not accrue on the cash. (h) Notices to Holders. Upon any adjustment of the Warrant Number pursuant to this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly thereafter, and in any event within ten days, (i) provide a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, Controller or any Assistant Controller of the Company setting forth the Warrant Number and the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculations are based and (ii) cause to be given to each of the Holders at its address appearing on the Register written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage prepaid. Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this Section 4.02(h). The Holders shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate. In case: (1) the Company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of shares of Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or of any other subscription rights or warrants; or (2) the Company shall authorize the distribution to all holders of shares of Common Stock of evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than Cash Dividends or Dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or distributions referred to in subsection (a) of this Section 4.02); or (3) of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety, or of any reclassification or change of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination), or a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock; or (4) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; or
17 (5) the Company proposes to take any action (other than actions of the character described in Section 4.02(a) hereof) which would require an adjustment of the Warrant Number pursuant to this Section 4.02, then the Company shall cause to be given to each Holder at its address appearing on the Register, at least 20 calendar days (or 10 calendar days in any case specified in clauses (1) or (2) above) prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, or promptly in the case of events for which there is no record date, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a written notice stating (i) the date as of which the holders of record of shares of Common Stock to be entitled to receive any such rights, options, warrants or distribution are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or consummated, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange such shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. The failure to give the notice required by this Section 4.02(h) or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution, right, option, warrant, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any action. (i) Voluntary Increase. The Company from time to time may increase the Warrant Number by any amount for any period of time (including, without limitation, permanently) if such period is at least 20 days. Whenever the Warrant Number is increased, the Company shall mail to the Holders a notice of the increase. The Company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced Warrant Number takes effect. The notice shall state the increased Warrant Number and the period it will be in effect. An increase of the Warrant Number does not change or adjust the Warrant Number otherwise in effect for purposes of subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02. (j) Notice of Certain Transactions. If: (1) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Warrant Number pursuant to subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02 and if the Company does not arrange for the Holders to participate pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section 4.02; (2) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental Warrant Agreement pursuant to subsection (k) of this Section 4.02; or (3) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company shall, if not already provided pursuant to Section 4.02(h) above, mail to the Holders a notice stating the proposed record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
18 lease, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall mail the notice at least 15 days before such date. Failure to mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction. (k) Reorganization of Company. If the Company consolidates or merges with or into any person, upon consummation of such transaction, the Warrants shall automatically become exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which the Holder would have owned immediately after such consolidation or merger if such Holder had exercised the Warrant immediately before the effective date of the transaction. Concurrently with the consummation of any such transaction, the corporation formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the Company shall enter into a supplemental Agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The successor Company shall mail to Holders a notice describing the supplemental Agreement. If the issuer of securities deliverable upon exercise of the Warrants under the supplemental Agreement is an affiliate of the formed or surviving, corporation, that issuer shall join in the supplemental Agreement. If this subsection (k) applies, subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02 do not apply. (l) When Issuance or Payment May Be Deferred. In any case in which this Section 4.02 shall require that an adjustment in the Warrant Number be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of any Warrant that is exercised after such record date the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Warrant Number prior to any adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof, provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's right to receive such additional Warrant Shares, other capital stock and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (m) Adjustment in Exercise Price. Upon each event that provides for an adjustment of the Warrant Number pursuant to this Section 4.02, Section 4.09 and Section 3 of the Registration Rights Agreement, each Warrant outstanding prior to making the adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to receive that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest ten millionth) equal to the adjusted Warrant Number at an Exercise Price per share of Common Stock obtained from the following formula: N E' = E x --- N' where: N' = the adjusted Warrant Number.
19 N = the Warrant Number prior to adjustment. E' = the adjusted Exercise Price per share of Common Stock. E = the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock. prior to adjustment. (n) Form of Warrants. (i) Irrespective of any adjustments in the Warrant Number or the number or kind of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, the Warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the Warrants initially issuable pursuant to this Agreement. (ii) The form of Warrant Certificate need not be changed because of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.02, and Warrant Certificates issued after such adjustment may state the same Warrant Number and the same number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants as are stated in the Warrant Certificates initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. The Company, however, may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant Certificate that they may deem appropriate to give effect to such adjustments and that does not affect the substance of the Warrant Certificate, and any Warrant Certificate thereafter issued, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant Certificate or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed. SECTION 4.03. Manner of Exercise. (1) The Warrants may be exercised upon (i) surrender to the Company of the related Warrant Certificate, together with the form of election attached thereto to purchase Common Stock on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed by the Holder thereof and (ii) payment to the Company of the Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares being purchased upon such exercise. (a) Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made (i) in cash or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company in New York Clearing House Funds, (ii) in the manner provided in the second paragraph of Section 4.01. (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in the third paragraph of Section 4.01, the Warrants shall be exercisable at the election of such Holder either in full or in part at any time or from time to time, but in no event later than the Expiration Date. SECTION 4.04. Transfer of Warrants and Warrant Shares. Upon the surrender of the Warrant Certificates and the payment of the Exercise Price, the Company shall issue, and shall cause its transfer agent for the Common Stock, which may be the Company (the "Transfer Agent"), to deliver with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written order of the respective Holder and in such name or names as such Holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares so purchased upon the exercise of such Warrants together with cash as provided in Section 4.05. Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any Person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a Holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date of the payment of the Exercise Price. To the extent required by Section 5.02(b), the Company shall, and shall cause the Transfer Agent to, comply with the requirements of such Section.
20 The Company shall keep copies of this Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the Holders during normal business hours at their respective offices at the addresses set forth in Section 7.04 hereof. SECTION 4.05. Fractional Warrant Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue fractional Warrant Shares on the exercise of the Warrants. If more than one Warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the same Holder, the number of full Warrant Shares which shall be issued upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants so presented. If any fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this Section 4.05, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant (or specified portion thereof), the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the Current Market Price per Warrant Share on the day immediately preceding the date the Warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction, computed to the nearest whole cent. SECTION 4.06. Reservation of Warrant Shares. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive or similar rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its authorized and issued Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to transfer Warrant Shares upon exercise of each Warrant, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants. The Holders shall have no duty to verify availability of such shares set aside by the Company. The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the Transfer Agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Company's Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Company will supply such Transfer Agent with duly executed stock certificates required to honor the Warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company will provide or otherwise make available any cash which may be payable as provided in Section 4.05 hereof. The Company will furnish such Transfer Agent a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto. SECTION 4.07. Compliance with Law. If any shares of Common Stock required to be reserved for purposes of exercise of the Warrants require, under any Federal or state law or applicable governing rule or regulation of any national securities exchange, registration with or approval of any Governmental Authority or listing on any such national securities exchange before such shares may be purchased upon exercise, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible endeavor also to cause such shares to be duly registered, approved or listed on the relevant national securities exchange, as the case may be. SECTION 4.08. Payment of Taxes. Except as set forth in Section 6.13, the Company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the issuance of Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any Warrant. SECTION 4.09. Failure to Deliver Shares. If, for any reason whatsoever, the Company shall fail to, or is otherwise unable to, deliver any Warrant Shares to any Holder upon the exercise of such Holder's Warrants (a "Share Delivery Default"), the Company hereby agrees to pay liquidated damages to the Holders on a monthly basis in an amount such that, each
21 Warrant outstanding shall evidence the right to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to the nearest ten millionth) obtained from the following formula: N' = N x 1.005 Where: N' = the adjusted number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by payment of the Exercise Price. N = the number of Warrant Shares previously issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by payment of the Exercise Price prior to adjustment. The adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall be made on a monthly basis beginning on and including the day following the Share Delivery Default to but excluding the day on which the Share Delivery Default has been cured. Following the cure of each such Share Delivery Default with respect to such Warrants and Warrant Shares, the accrual of liquidated damages with respect to such Warrants and Warrant Shares will cease. ARTICLE V Transfer Restrictions SECTION 5.01. Restrictions on Transfers of the Warrants and the Warrant Shares. The following restrictions on transfer shall apply to the Warrants and Warrant Shares: (a) No Holder or transferee thereof shall sell, transfer or convey in any manner whatsoever any Warrant or Warrant Shares except in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. (b) Each Holder may, without the consent of the Company, sell or assign any Warrants or Warrant Shares and the other rights and obligations of such Holder to any Person or any assignee thereof (an "Assignee"). The Assignee shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and such Warrants and shall provide: (i) if such Warrants or Warrant Shares are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or Regulation S under the Securities Act or, in the case of the Warrant Shares, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse of the Warrant Certificate) and, in the case of a transfer pursuant to Rule 144, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that such transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act or any other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company as to the compliance with the legend set forth in Exhibit B; or
22 (ii) if such Warrants or Warrant Shares are being transferred in reliance on another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse of the Warrant Certificate), an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company to the effect that such transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act and a representation letter from the transferee in the form of Exhibit C hereto, and effective immediately upon such transfer or assignment, the Assignee shall be deemed a Holder and shall have the rights and obligation of a Holder pursuant to this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any Holder may assign all or any portion of the Warrants or Warrant Shares held by it as collateral security. SECTION 5.02. Notation; Removal of Legend. (a) A notation will be made in the appropriate transfer records of the Company with respect to any such transfer of the Warrants and Warrant Shares referred to in this Agreement. (b) If any Warrant or Warrant Shares are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, the Company shall, or shall cause the Transfer Agent to, remove from any Warrant Certificate or other certificate representing the Warrant Shares, the transfer restriction legend set forth in Exhibit B hereto or any other legend or markings which in any way purport to restrict the transferability of the Warrants or the Warrant Shares. SECTION 5.03. Surrender of Warrant Certificates. Any Warrant Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange or exercise of the Warrants represented thereby shall, if surrendered to the Company, be promptly canceled by the Company and shall not be reissued by the Company and, except as provided in this Article V or in Article III hereof in case of the exercise of less than all the Warrants represented thereby or in case of a mutilated Warrant Certificate or in the case of a transfer, no Warrant Certificate shall be issued hereunder in lieu thereof. The Company shall dispose of such canceled Warrant Certificates in any manner as the Company may so desire. ARTICLE VI Miscellaneous SECTION 6.01. SEC Reports and other Financial Information. The Company shall provide the Holders, within 15 days after the Company files the same with the SEC, copies of the Company's annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, provided that if any such information, documents or reports are filed with the SEC and available to Holders through EDGAR, then no such information, documents or other reports need be provided. Notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to remain subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, until such time
23 as there are no Warrants or Warrant Shares which constitute Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the Company shall continue to file such annual reports and information, documents and other reports with the SEC, if such continue to be accepted by the SEC, and the Company shall provide the Holders with such annual reports and such information, documents and other reports as the Company provides to the holders of its Common Stock or other securities. SECTION 6.02. Persons Benefiting. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the Company and the Holders any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part hereof. SECTION 6.03. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be granted except by the written agreement of the Company and the holders of a majority of the Warrants then outstanding. SECTION 6.04. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, by facsimile transmission, provided that any matter transmitted by the Company by facsimile (i) shall be immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the number specified on the applicable signature page hereof, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by a hard copy original thereof by express courier) and faxed or delivered, to the address or facsimile number specified for notices on the applicable signature page hereof or to such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto. (a) All such notices, requests and communications (i) sent by express courier will be effective upon delivery to or refusal to accept delivery by the addressee, and (ii) transmitted by facsimile will be effective when sent and facsimile confirmation received; except that all notices and other communications to any Holder shall not be effective until actually received. (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any agreement of any Holder to receive certain notices by telephone and facsimile is solely for the convenience and at the request of the Company. The Holder shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the Company to give such notice and the Holder shall not have any liability to the Company or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by the Holder in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. (c) If the notice or communication shall be in writing, then such notice or communication shall be delivered (i) to the Company at the address set forth below in this Section 6.04(c) (or to such other address or addresses as the Company may notify the Holders in accordance with this Section 6.04), (ii) to any Initial Holder at the address or addresses set forth on the schedules attached hereto (or to such other address or addresses as such Initial Holder may notify the Company in accordance with this Section 6.04) and (iii) to any other Holders at the address or addresses provided by such Holder to the Company in accordance with this Section 6.04 upon becoming a Holder (or to such other address or addresses as such Initial Holder may notify the Company in accordance with this Section 6.04):

A COPY OF THE INTERCREDITOR AND SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT REFERENCED IN THIS LEGEND IS ON FILE WITH THE COLLATERAL AGENT AND IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION AT THE COLLATERAL AGENT'S OFFICES AT DEUTSCHE BANK TRUST COMPANY AMERICAS, 100 PLAZA ONE, MS: 0603, JERSEY CITY, NJ 07311. THIS CERTIFIES THAT [ ], or its registered assigns, is the registered holder of the number of Warrants set forth above (the "Warrants"). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof (the "Holder"), at its option and subject to the provisions contained herein and in the Warrant Agreement referred to below, to purchase from PG&E CORPORATION, a California corporation ("the Company"), one share of Common Stock, no par value (the "Common Stock"), of the Company, at the per share Exercise Price of $0.01 (the "Exercise Price"). Each Warrant shall terminate and become void as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the later of (i) September 2, 2006 and (ii) to the extent that any Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in the Equity Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2002, among the Company, LB I Group Inc. and each other entity named on the signature pages thereof (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), remain outstanding on September 6, 2006 and ten Business Days after the effective date of a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, but no later than September 2, 2007 (the "Expiration Date"). The number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant (the "Warrant Number") and the Exercise Price per share shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events enumerated in the Warrant Agreement. This Warrant Certificate is issued under and in accordance with the Warrant Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2002 (the "Warrant Agreement"), by and among the Company and each entity named on the signature pages thereof (each, an "Initial Holder" and collectively, the "Initial Holders"), and is subject to the terms and provisions contained in the Warrant Agreement, to all of which terms and provisions the Holder of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate consents by acceptance hereof. The Warrant Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Reference is hereby made to the Warrant Agreement for a full statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and obligations of the Company and the Holders of the Warrants. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Warrant Agreement. The Warrants will initially be delivered by the Company to the Initial Holder on June 25, 2002. Subject to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part by presentation and surrender of this Warrant Certificate with the Election to Purchase attached hereto duly executed and with the simultaneous payment of the Exercise Price in cash or check to the Company (for its account) at the office of the Company designated for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Warrants may also be exercised without exchange of funds pursuant to the net exercise ("Cashless Exercise") provisions of Section 4.01 of the Warrant Agreement. As provided in the Warrant Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein set forth, the Warrants shall be exercisable at any time and from time to time on any Business Day on or after June 25, 2002 but no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Expiration Date; provided, however, that Holders of Warrants will only be able to exercise their Warrants (i) by means of a Cashless Exercise or (ii) if any Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to the Warrant Shares is effective or the exercise of such Warrants is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and such securities are qualified for sale or exempt from qualification under the applicable securities laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which such Holders reside; provided, further, however, that no Warrant shall be exercisable after the Expiration Date. No Holder may exercise any Warrant to the extent that, immediately following such exercise and upon receipt of any Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, such Holder would either (i) become or be included in any 13D Person that is the single largest holder of voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise become the single largest holder of the Common Stock) (the "Shareholder Limitation"), or (ii) beneficially own (as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) or be included in any 13D Person that beneficially owns in excess of 4.9% of the voting power represented by the Company's capital stock (or otherwise beneficially own in excess of 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock) (the "4.9% Limitation") after, in either case, giving effect to such exercise (the Shareholder Limitation and the 4.9% Limitation are collectively referred to herein as the "Exercise Limitations"). The determinations of the number of shares that (i) constitute 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock or voting power and (ii) are held by the largest holder will be made in reliance upon the information contained in publicly available filings made with the SEC unless the Company is aware that such information is incorrect and has made the correct information public, to the extent material, and disclosed such information to the Holders at the time of any such proposed exercise. In order to facilitate compliance with the foregoing, each Holder will be required to make a representation that it and its affiliates will comply with the Exercise Limitations immediately after the exercise of any Warrant and receipt of any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise. 2
Notwithstanding the Exercise Limitation, however, a Holder may exercise any Warrant that would otherwise cause such Holder to hold Warrant Shares in excess of the Exercise Limitations if, as to such excess number of Warrant Shares (the "Excess Shares"), such Holder (i) irrevocably covenants to the Company to sell such Excess Shares within 10 days after the date of exercise and (ii) confirms that it has, on or prior to such exercise date, entered into a binding arrangement to sell the Excess Shares within 10 days after such exercise date either (a) in a regular way transaction on a national securities exchange (or the principal market where shares of Common Stock are then traded) or (b) to one or more persons that are not "affiliates" (used herein as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act) of such Holder ("Third Parties"), each of whom represents for the benefit of the Company that, upon purchase of the applicable Excess Shares, such Third Party, together with its affiliates, will not be the beneficial owner of a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exercise Limitations. In addition, such Holder shall agree to vote the applicable Excess Shares only in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company or any Third Party that has agreed to purchase such shares, if any record date for a vote of the Common Stock is established for any day between the exercise date and the consummation of the sale of the applicable Excess Shares. The Exercise Limitations will cease to have any force and effect upon consummation of the Utility Spin-Off, if, on the date that is 14 days after delivery to the Company of a request by the Required Holders to such effect (which request may be given no more than once during any 180-day period), the Company shall not have delivered a certificate to the Holders stating that the removal of the Exercise Limitations would, in the good faith judgment of the Company, not be consistent with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements. The Holders are entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the Warrant Shares. Said registration rights are set forth in full in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Warrant Agreement provides that the number of Warrant Shares and the Exercise Price may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted. No fractional Warrant Shares will be issued upon the exercise of the Warrants, but the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the Current Market Value per Warrant Share on the day immediately preceding the date the Warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by the fraction of a Warrant Share that would be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant. The Company may require from the transferring or exchanging Holder payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Warrant Agreement and exchanges in respect of portions of Warrants not exercised and the Company may deduct such taxes from any payment of money to be made and such transfer or exchange shall not be consummated (if such taxes are not deducted in full) unless or until the Holder shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. Upon any exercise of the Warrants for less than all of the Warrants represented by this Warrant Certificate, there shall be issued to the Holder hereof a new Warrant Certificate representing those Warrants which were not exercised. This Warrant Certificate may be exchanged at the office of the Company by presenting this Warrant Certificate properly endorsed with a request to exchange this Warrant Certificate for other Warrant Certificates evidencing an 3
equal number of Warrants. All shares of Common Stock issuable by the Holders upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable. The holder in whose name this Warrant Certificate is registered may be deemed and treated by the Company as the absolute owner of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate for all purposes whatsoever and the Company shall not be affected by notice to the contrary. The Warrants do not entitle any Holder hereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS WARRANT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. [Signature page follows] 4

Shelf Registration. (a) The Issuer shall: (i) use its best efforts to not later than the date that is 90 days after the date of the consummation of a "plan of reorganization" under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to PG&E (the "Initial Registration Trigger Date"), cause to be filed a registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (together with any amendments thereto, the "Initial Shelf Registration Statement"), which Initial Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities held by, or issuable to, the Holders (or which may be issued to the Holders at any time upon conversion of any PIK Securities, as reasonably determined by the Issuer) that have provided the information required pursuant to the terms of Section 2(c) hereof; (ii) use its best efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission not later than 180 days after the Registration Trigger Date (the "Initial Effectiveness Target Date"); and (iii) after such Initial Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, keep the Initial Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective,

(b) Following the expiration of the Initial Effectiveness Period, the Issuer may make a Shelf Termination Election by delivering written notice thereof and, evidence of the satisfaction of the Transfer Conditions to each Holder of Securities or Transfer Restricted Securities. In the event, however, that, following the expiration of the Initial Effectiveness Period and the making of such Shelf Termination Election, the Issuer issues any PIK Securities and the Transfer Conditions have not been satisfied with respect to any such issuance then the Issuer shall: (i) use its best efforts to file, not later than 20 days after the date on which such PIK Securities are issued (the "Subsequent Registration Trigger Date" and, together with the Initial Registration Trigger Date, a "Registration Trigger Date") cause to be filed a registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (together with any amendments thereto, the "Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement" and, together with the Initial Shelf Registration Statement, a "Shelf Registration Statement") which Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities held by Holders (or which may be issued to the Holders at any time upon conversion of any PIK Securities) that have provided the information required pursuant to the terms of Section 2(c) hereof; (ii) use its best efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission not later than 60 days after
7 the Subsequent Registration Trigger Date (the "Subsequent Effectiveness Target Date" and, together with the Initial Effectiveness Target Date, the "Effectiveness Target Date"); and (iii) after such Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, keep the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Section 4(b) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that (A) it is available for resales by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities entitled to the benefit of this Agreement and (B) conforms with the requirements of this Agreement and the Securities Act for a period (the "Subsequent Effectiveness Period" and, together with the Initial Effectiveness Period, the "Effectiveness Period") ending on the earlier of: (1) the earlier of (A) the second anniversary of the most recent date on which any such PIK Securities were authenticated by the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture and (B) the date on which the Transfer Conditions are satisfied; or (2) such shorter period that will terminate when (x) all of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities are able to sell all Transfer Restricted Securities immediately without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto; provided, however, that, in the case of any Conversion Shares issued or issuable upon conversion of any PIK Securities, the Transfer Conditions have been satisfied or the date as of which this determination is made is at least two years after the issue date of such PIK Security, (y) when no Securities or Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding (whether as a result of repurchase and cancellation, conversion or otherwise) or (z) all Transfer Restricted Securities have been registered under the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement and have been sold in accordance therewith. (c) No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be permitted to include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless such Holder completes a Selling Securityholder Notice and Questionnaire, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (as the same may be amended or modified from time to time to reasonably reflect changes in applicable law) (the "Questionnaire"), and delivers it to the Issuer prior to or on the 15th Business Day after such Holder's receipt of the Questionnaire from the Issuer (each such deadline, a "Questionnaire Deadline"). Prior to such time, each Holder may complete the Questionnaire and deliver it to the Issuer prior to such request and, as a result, shall be entitled to have its Transfer Restricted Securities included in the applicable Shelf Registration Statement filed with the Commission. In addition, upon receipt of one or more written requests for additional information from the Issuer, each Holder who intends to be named as a selling securityholder in the applicable Shelf Registration Statement shall furnish to the Issuer in writing, within 15 Business Days after such Holder's receipt of such request, such additional information regarding such Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of its Transfer Restricted Securities, in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement
8 or Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus included therein and in any application to be filed with or under state securities law, as the Issuer may reasonably request. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to Registration Failure Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 3 hereof unless such Holder shall have provided such reasonably requested information prior to or on the applicable Questionnaire Deadline. Each Holder whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being registered pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement agrees to furnish promptly to the Issuer all information required to be disclosed in order to make information previously furnished to the Issuer by such Holder not materially misleading. 3. Registration Failure Liquidated Damages. (a) If: (i) any Shelf Registration Statement has not been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable Effectiveness Target Date; or (ii) except as provided in Section 4(b)(i) hereof, any Shelf Registration Statement is filed and declared effective but, during the applicable Effectiveness Period, shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without there being filed with the Commission within ten Business Days a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that cures such failure and, in the case of a post-effective amendment, is itself immediately declared effective; (each such event referred to in foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a "Registration Default"), the Issuer hereby agrees, subject to Section 2(c), to pay liquidated damages ("Registration Failure Liquidated Damages") with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default has been cured, accruing at a rate: (A) in respect of the Securities, to each holder of Securities, equal to 0.50% per annum of the Applicable Amount of the Securities; and (B) in respect of any Conversion Shares, to each holder of Conversion Shares, equal to 0.50% per annum of the Applicable Amount of the Conversion Shares. (b) All accrued Registration Failure Liquidated Damages shall be paid in arrears to Record Holders by the Issuer on each Damages Payment Date (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check or (ii) in PIK Securities. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any particular Security or Conversion Share, the accrual of Registration Failure Liquidated Damages with respect to such Security or Conversion Share will cease. The Issuer agrees to deliver all notices, certificates and other documents contemplated by the Indenture in connection with the payment of Registration Failure Liquidated Damages.
9 All obligations of the Issuer set forth in this Section 3 that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such Transfer Restricted Security shall have been satisfied in full; provided, however, that the Registration Failure Liquidated Damages shall cease to accrue on the last day of the Effectiveness Period. The Registration Failure Liquidated Damages set forth above shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities for such Registration Default; provide, however, that the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to any remedy (including, without limitation, monetary damages) which the Holders may have at law or in equity in the event that the Issuer engages in conduct which either is grossly negligent or intentionally malfeasant; provided, further, however, that in no event shall the Issuer's filing and prosecution in good faith of a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and advice of a firm of qualified securities counsel be considered as grossly negligent or intentionally malfeasant for purposes of this Agreement 4. Registration Procedures. (a) In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement, the Issuer shall comply with all the provisions of Section 4(b) hereof and shall use its best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto, shall as expeditiously as possible prepare and file with the Commission a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Securities Act. (b) In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement and any Prospectus required by this Agreement to permit the sale or resale of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Issuer shall: (i) subject to any notice by the Issuer in accordance with this Section 4(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iii)(D), use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause such Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the Effectiveness Period, the Issuer shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and such Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as practicable thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may suspend the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement by written notice (which notice shall not contain any material nonpublic information) to the Holders for a period
10 (each such period, a "Suspension Period"); provided that the Company shall promptly notify the Holders in writing (which notice shall not contain any material non-public information) of the date the Suspension Period will begin and the expected duration of such period; and provided, further, that no Suspension Period shall exceed 45 consecutive days and all such Suspension Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of 90 days within any consecutive twelve-month period if: (x) an event occurs and is continuing as a result of which such Shelf Registration Statement would, in the Issuer's reasonable judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (y) the Issuer reasonably determines that the disclosure of such event at such time would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Issuer (and its subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole); Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Holder has, prior to the receipt of notice of the commencement of a Suspension Period, entered into a binding contract to sell any Conversion Shares pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, and in accordance with the plan of distribution therein, the Issuer agrees not to prevent its transfer agent from delivering such Conversion Shares to the purchaser thereof without any restrictive legend and otherwise in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Indenture. The Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any documents, opinions or other information reasonably requested by the transfer agent in connection with any such sale. (ii) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in force) under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424 and 430A under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. (iii) Advise the underwriter(s), if any, and selling Holders promptly (but in any event within five Business Days) and, if requested by such Persons, to confirm such advice in writing (provided, however, that in no event shall such advice contain any material non-public information):
11 (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to any Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to any Shelf Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act or any notification with respect to the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, or (D) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event (the nature of which need not be disclosed) during the Effectiveness Period, that makes any statement of a material fact made in any Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in any Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of a Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Holder of Securities, by accepting the same, agrees to hold any communication from the Company pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iii) in confidence. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Issuer shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time and will provide to the Purchasers and each Holder who is named in such Shelf Registration Statement prompt notice of the withdrawal of any such order (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material non-public information). (iv) Furnish to each of the selling Holders and each of the underwriter(s), if any, before filing with the Commission, one copy of any Shelf Registration Statement and copies of any Prospectus included therein or any

A selling Holder or underwriter, if any, shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing only if a Shelf Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains a material misstatement or omission with respect to the information concerning such Holder or its intended plan of distribution with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. (v) Make available at reasonable times for inspection by one or more representatives of the selling Holders, designated in writing by a Majority of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are included in a Shelf Registration Statement, any underwriter participating in any distribution pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by such selling Holders or any of the underwriter(s), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Issuer as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise any applicable due diligence responsibilities, and cause the Issuer's officers, directors, managers and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative or representatives of the selling Holders, underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement after the filing thereof and before its effectiveness, provided, however, that any information designated by the Issuer as confidential at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by the recipient thereof; provided, further, that in no event shall the Issuer be required to furnish any material nonpublic information pursuant to this subsection (v).

(vii) Deliver to each selling Holder and each of the underwriter(s), if any, without charge, upon the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably may request; subject to any notice by the Issuer in accordance with this Section 4(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iii) (D), the Issuer hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders and each of the underwriter(s), if any, in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. (viii) The Issuer shall: (A) upon request, furnish to each selling Holder and each underwriter in the case of an underwritten registration where an underwriting agreement is entered into, if any, in such substance and scope as they may reasonably request and as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings for selling security holders, upon the date of closing of any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Registration: (1) opinions, each dated the date of such closing, of counsel to the Issuer covering such of the matters as are customarily covered in legal opinions to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings of securities; and (2) customary comfort letters, dated the date of such closing, from the Issuer's independent accountants (and from any other accountants whose report is contained or incorporated by reference in the Shelf Registration Statement) in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings of securities; (B) set forth in full in the underwriting agreement, if any, indemnification provisions and procedures which provide rights no less protective than those set forth in Section 6 hereof with respect to all parties to be indemnified by the Issuer; and (C) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by such parties to evidence compliance with clause (A) above and with
14 any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the selling Holders pursuant to this clause (ix). (ix) Before any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the selling Holders, the underwriter(s), if any, and their respective counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the selling Holders or underwriter(s), if any, may reasonably request, use best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required (A) to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or a dealer of securities where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or (B) to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not now so subject. (x) Cooperate with the selling Holders and the underwriter(s), if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends (unless required by applicable securities laws); and enable such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, may request at least two Business Days before any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities made by such selling Holders or underwriter(s).

(xii) Subject to Section 4(b)(i) hereof, if any fact or event contemplated by Section 4(b)(iii)(D) hereof shall exist or have occurred, use its best efforts to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to any purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. (xiii) [Reserved]

If so directed by the Issuer, each Holder will deliver to the Issuer (at the Issuer's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice of suspension.

Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, such Holder's officers, directors and employees and each person, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an "Indemnified Holder"), from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities) ("Liabilities"), to which such Indemnified Holder may become subject, insofar as any such Liability arises out of, or is based upon:
17 (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or (B) any blue sky application or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto prepared or executed by the Issuer (or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Issuer expressly for use in such blue sky application or other document or amendment on supplement) filed in any jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities law of any state or other jurisdiction (such application or document being hereinafter called a "Blue Sky Application"); or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall reimburse each Indemnified Holder promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such Liability as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to any Holder in any such case to the extent that any such Liability arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto or Blue Sky Application in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Holder or its related Indemnified Holder specifically for use in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus and provided, further, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to the underwriter for any Holder or, in the case of any non-underwritten offering, to any Holder or its related Indemnified Holder to the extent that (A) such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus if (i) such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, failed to send or deliver a copy of the final prospectus with or prior to the delivery of written confirmation of the sale by such Holder to the Person asserting the claim from which such Liabilities arise, to the extent such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, was required to send and deliver such final prospectus, and (ii) the final prospectus would have corrected such untrue statement or such omission; or (B) such Liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or omission in any such prospectus if (x) such untrue statement or omission is corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus, and (y) having previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Issuer with copies of such prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such underwriter or Holder, as applicable, thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of a Security to the Person asserting the claim from which such Liability arises. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have to any Indemnified Holder. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Holder and shall survive the transfer of the Transfer Restricted Securities by such Holder. (b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, its officers, directors and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any Liability, joint or several, in
18 respect thereof, to which the Issuer or any such officer, director, employee or controlling person may become subject, insofar as any such Liability arises out of, or is based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Blue Sky Application; or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Holder (or its related Indemnified Holder) specifically for use therein, and shall reimburse the Issuer and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Issuer or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such Liability as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Holder may otherwise have to the Issuer or any of its directors, officers, employees or controlling persons and any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Holder shall be liable under this Section 6(b) for any amount in excess of the net proceeds to such Holder as a result of the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that a Majority of Holders shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent jointly a Majority of Holders and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by a Majority of Holders against the Issuer or any of its directors, officers, employees or controlling persons under this Section 6; and, provided further, that if a Majority of Holders shall
19 have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to them and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Issuer and its officers, directors, employees and controlling persons, the fees and expenses of a single separate counsel shall be paid by the Issuer. No indemnifying party shall: (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any Liability referred to therein, each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Liability: (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer from the offering and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the one hand and a Holder with respect to the sale by such Holder of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the other, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (6)(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) but also the relative fault of the Issuer on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions that resulted in such Liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuer on the one hand and a Holder on the other with respect to such offering and such sale shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuer on the one hand, bear to the total proceeds received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities on the other. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuer on the one hand or the Holders on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
20 correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Issuer and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Liability referred to above in this Section 6 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 6, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Transfer Restricted Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 6(d) are several and not joint. 7. Rules 144 and 144A. The Issuer shall file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Issuer is not required to file such reports, it will, upon written request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A, if the Conversion Price meets the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i). The Issuer covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell such Transfer Restricted Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A, if the Conversion Price meets the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3)(i), (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Issuer will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities identified to the Issuer upon request by any Purchaser. Upon the request of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Issuer shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Issuer to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act. 8. Participation in Underwritten Registrations. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder: (i) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 9. Selection of Underwriters. The Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted
21 Securities in an Underwritten Offering if approved by the Issuer. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the Issuer; provided that such investment bankers and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to the Majority of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are included in such offering. 10. Miscellaneous. (a) Remedies. The Issuer acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Issuer to comply with its obligations under Section 2 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Issuer's obligations under Section 2 hereof. The Issuer further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) Adjustments Affecting Transfer Restricted Securities. The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities as a class that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities to include such Transfer Restricted Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. (c) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuer will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. In addition, the Issuer shall not grant to any of its security holders (other than the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in such capacity) the right to include any of its securities in any Shelf Registration Statement provided for in this Agreement other than the Transfer Restricted Securities. The Issuer has not previously entered into any agreement (which has not expired or been terminated) granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person which rights conflict with the provisions hereof. (d) Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Issuer has obtained the written consent of a Majority of Holders. (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, facsimile transmission, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (i) If to a Purchaser, at the address for such Purchaser set forth below such Purchaser's signature on the signature page(s) hereof; (ii) if to a Holder who is not otherwise a Purchaser, at the address set forth on the counterpart signature page to this Agreement provided by such Holder pursuant to Section 10(f) below and
22 (iii) if to the Issuer: PG&E Corporation One Market, Spear Tower Suite 2400 San Francisco, California 94105 Attention: Assistant Treasurer Facsimile: (415) 267-7265 Telephone: (415) 267-7052 With copies to: PG&E Corporation One Market, Spear Tower Suite 2400 San Francisco, California 94105 Attention: Chief Counsel - Corporate Facsimile: (415) 817-8225 Telephone: (415) 817-8200 and Latham & Watkins 633 West Fifth Street Suite 4000 Los Angeles, California 90071 Attention: Tom Sadler Facsimile: (213) 891-8763 Telephone: (213) 485-1234 All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt acknowledged, if transmitted by facsimile; and on the next Business Day, if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. (f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities; provided, however, that (i) this Agreement shall not inure to the benefit of or be binding upon a successor or assign of a Holder unless and to the extent such successor or assign is a Permitted Assign (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or acquired Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder in compliance with any restrictions on transfer applicable thereto and (ii) nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted Securities shall
23 be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Issuer hereby agrees to extend the benefits of this Agreement to subsequent Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who execute a counterpart signature page hereto. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement; provided that a facsimile signature shall be considered due execution and shall be binding upon the signatory thereto with the same force and effect as if the signature were an original, not a facsimile signature. (h) Securities Held by the Issuer or Its Affiliates. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Transfer Restricted Securities is required hereunder, Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Issuer or its "affiliates" (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) (other than the Purchasers or subsequent Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Transfer Restricted Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage. (i) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (j) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. (k) Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired or invalidated thereby. (l) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and the registration rights granted by the Issuer with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the registration rights granted by the Issuer with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. [Signature pages follow]
