        no covered report omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements in the covered report, in light of the         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the         case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of the date on which it was filed).
(2) I have reviewed the contents of this statement with PG&E Corporations audit committee.
