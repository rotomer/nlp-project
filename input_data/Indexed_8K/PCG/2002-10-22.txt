Item 5. Other Events
          On October 18, 2002, PG&E Corporation entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement), with the lenders party thereto, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent, and others, pursuant to which the existing $420 million Tranche B loan previously made by certain of the lenders has been modified (as modified, the Tranche B loan) and certain of the lenders have made new incremental loans in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million (New Loans) with the same terms and conditions as  those applicable to the Tranche B Loan.  The Tranche B loan and the New Loans are collectively referred to herein as the Loans.  The New Loans have been funded into a separate escrow account and will be released to PG&E Corporation on January 17, 2003, unless a bankruptcy proceeding has been commenced by or against PG&E Corporation.  The Loans are payable in a single installment on September 2, 2006, unless prepaid earlier in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
          The Tranche B loan and the New Loans are senior, unsubordinated obligations of PG&E Corporation, which are pari passu with each other.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the options granted to certain lenders of PG&E Corporation to purchase shares of PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. (NEG, Inc.) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Option Agreement entered into on June 25, 2002 (Option Agreement) remain outstanding, the obligations of PG&E Corporation in respect of such options are senior to its obligations in respect of the Loans to the extent provided in the Intercreditor Agreement previously entered into on June 25, 2002, among the lenders party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 25, 2002.  So long as the options remain outstanding, the Intercreditor Agreement will remain in effect to define the extent to which the obligations of PG&E Corporation in respect of such options are senior to its obligations in respect of the Loans.  GPSF-F Inc. (GPSF), an affiliate of General Electric Capital Corporation, the Tranche A lender under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 25, 2002, has exercised its put option under the Option Agreement, and GPSF and PG&E Corporation are in the process of conducting the appraisal process provided under the Option Agreement.  PG&E Corporation and PG&E National Energy Group, LLC, (LLC), a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation which owns 100% of the common stock of NEG, Inc., have agreed with the other holders of options under the Option Agreement that they may exercise their put option on the same terms as those received by GPSF within 45 days after the closing of the put option of GPSF, and, that if not exercised within such 45-day period, the put option is exercisable during any time prior to March 1, 2003.
          All obligations of PG&E Corporation with respect to the Loans are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in 100% of the equity interests in LLC and 100% of the common stock of NEG, Inc., and all proceeds thereof (NEG Collateral); such security interests secure equally and ratably the portions of the Loans held by each lender.  PG&E Corporation is not permitted to dispose of the NEG Collateral except under certain circumstances.  Any proceeds of a permitted disposition of the NEG Collateral must be applied to prepay the Loans.  PG&E Corporation may spin off the NEG Collateral only with the consent of lenders holding more than 50.1% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans.
          In addition, all obligations of PG&E Corporation with respect to the Loans are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in the outstanding common stock of PG&E Corporations subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), and all proceeds thereof.  With respect to 35% of such common stock pledged for the benefit of the lenders, the lenders have customary rights of a pledgee of common stock, provided that certain regulatory approvals may be required in connection with any foreclosure on such stock.  With respect to the remaining 65%, such common stock has been pledged for the benefit of the lenders, but the lenders have no ability to control such common stock under any circumstances and do not have any of the typical rights and remedies of a secured creditor.  However, the lenders do have the right to receive any cash proceeds received upon a disposition of such common stock.
          In connection with the consummation of the Utilitys proposed plan of reorganization (PG&E Plan) in the Utilitys bankruptcy proceeding pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, the Utility has formed a new corporation (Newco) to hold the equity interests in three limited liability companies (Reorganization Subsidiaries) formed to hold certain assets of the Utility.  The PG&E Plan contemplates that, after the transfer of such assets to the Reorganization Subsidiaries, the Utility will distribute the common stock of Newco to PG&E Corporation (the Newco Spin) and PG&E Corporation will distribute the common stock of the Utility to the shareholders of PG&E Corporation (collectively, the Spin).  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the Pledge Agreements pledging the common stock of the Utility, PG&E Corporation may substitute common stock of Newco for the common stock of the Utility in connection with the consummation of the PG&E Plan. 
          Finally, all obligations of PG&E Corporation with respect to the Loans are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all other personal property assets of PG&E Corporation with certain exceptions, including, without limitation, deposit accounts, securities accounts and cash equivalents (other than proceeds of other collateral).
          PG&E Corporation is required to make an offer to prepay the Loans (including prepayment premiums) upon a change in control of PG&E Corporation.  PG&E Corporation also is required to make an offer to prepay the Loans (including prepayment premiums), at least 45 days before (1) a spin-off under any plan of reorganization: (a) to the shareholders of PG&E Corporation of (i) all or any portion of Utility, Newco or any of the Reorganization Subsidiaries or (ii) any of the material assets that are contemplated by the PG&E Plan to be transferred to Newco or any Reorganization Subsidiary or retained by the Utility (Material Reorganization Assets), or (b) to PG&E Corporation of (i) all or any portion of Newco or any of the Reorganization Subsidiaries or (ii) any Material Reorganization Assets or (2) the sale or issuance of more than 15% of the capital stock of the Utility pursuant to a plan of reorganization.
          In addition, if on the date 31 days after confirmation of any plan of reorganization that does not involve a spin-off or sale of more than 15% of the capital stock of the Utility or on the first day of any calendar quarter thereafter, the ratio of (i) the aggregate market value of the common stock of PG&E Corporation for the preceding 30 trading days to (ii) the aggregate outstanding amount of the Loans is less than 5.0:1.0, then PG&E Corporation is required to make an offer to prepay the Loans (including prepayment premiums) on the date 30 days thereafter.
          PG&E Corporation is required to maintain an interest reserve account of at least $130 million until September 2, 2005, and thereafter, an amount equal to the lesser of $130 million or the interest to accrue on the Loans through maturity. 
          The Credit Agreement continues to contain certain limitations on the ability of PG&E Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries to grant liens, consolidate, merge, purchase or sell assets, declare or pay dividends, incur indebtedness, or make advances, loans and investments.  However, the Credit Agreement does not limit (1) the ability of LLC, NEG, Inc., or their respective subsidiariesto grant liens or incur debt and (2) PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated in the PG&E Plan.  The Credit Agreement generally permits LLC, NEG, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries to enter into sales and other disposition of assets in the ordinary course of business and in certain qualified transactions.  In addition, in connection with certain sales and debt restructuring transactions of NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries, PG&E Corporation is permitted to make investments funded from existing cash and future earnings in NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries or in entities that acquire such assets from NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries in such transactions.  The amount of such investments is limited to 75% of the net cash tax savings (less certain costs and expenses) actually received by PG&E Corporation after October 1, 2002 as a result of certain transactions of NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  PG&E Corporation also is permitted to make investments funded from existing cash and future earnings in NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and pay obligations of NEG, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any obligations for which PG&E Corporation becomes a surety or a guarantor) up to a cumulative amount not to exceed $15 million, provided that no default or event of default has occurred under the Credit Agreement, and provided further that LLC and NEG, Inc, are not in bankruptcy.  The proceeds of the New Loans may not be used to make investments in LLC or NEG, Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries.
          The Credit Agreement has been amended to delete provisions that required NEG, Inc. to maintain certain credit ratings and required that a certain ratio of fair market value of NEG, Inc. to the aggregate amount of the outstanding Loans be maintained.  Further, the Credit Agreement no longer provides that a default or event of default under agreements of NEG, Inc. or its subsidiaries constitutes a cross-default under the Credit Agreement. 
          Among other events, the Credit Agreement provides that an event of default occurs if PG&E Corporation fails to pay any indebtedness of $100 million or more when due, if the holders of PG&E Corporation indebtedness of $100 million or more become entitled to accelerate such indebtedness, or if any PG&E Corporation indebtedness of $100 million or more is accelerated. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders may declare the Loans immediately due and payable. 
          The Loans may be prepaid upon payment of a prepayment fee equal to (1) if such prepayment is made on or prior to October 1, 2003, the discounted present value of 2.50% of the principal amount of such prepayment plus the aggregate amount of interest that would accrue on the principal amount of such prepayment from the date of such prepayment to October 1, 2003, (2) if such prepayment is made after October 1, 2003 and on or prior to October 1, 2004, 2.5% of the principal amount prepaid, and (3) if such prepayment is made after October 1, 2004, 0.5% of the principal amount prepaid.
          The Credit Agreement also generally requires mandatory prepayments of the Loans with the net cash proceeds from (1) incurrence of indebtedness, (2) issuance or sale of equity by PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (3) sales of assets by PG&E Corporation, NEG, Inc., LLC, or any subsidiary of NEG, Inc. (with a carve-out for proceeds retained by NEG), (4) the receipt of condemnation or insurance proceeds, (5) and distributions or dividends paid to PG&E Corporation or LLC.  PG&E Corporation must also pay a prepayment fee upon mandatory prepayment.
          PG&E Corporation also has agreed to issue to the lenders additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation with a value equal to 3.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans ($25.2 million).  The actual number of warrants to be issued will be calculated by dividing such value by the average of the volume weighted average price of PG&E Corporation common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the 10 trading days beginning on October 10, 2002 and ending October 24, 2002.  The terms and provisions of the warrants, including a warrant exercise price of $0.01 per share, are substantially identical to the warrants previously issued to the Tranche B lenders on June 25, 2002.  PG&E Corporation has agreed to provide, following consummation of a plan of reorganization of the Utility, registration rights in connection with the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants.
          The net proceeds of the New Loans will be used to fund corporate working capital and general corporate purposes and may not be used to make investments in LLC or NEG, Inc. or any of their respective subsidiaries or, except as required by applicable law or the conditions adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission with respect to holding companies, in the Utility.
          PG&E Corporations 7.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 in the aggregate principal amount of $280 million issued on June 25, 2002 (Notes) and the Indenture relating to the Notes have been amended to delete certain cross-default provisions which provided that a non-payment or an acceleration of indebtedness of NEG, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, or a bankruptcy event with respect to NEG, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, constituted a default or event of default under the Notes and the Indenture.  Further, the Indenture and the Notes have been amended, among other things, to increase the interest rate on the Notes to 9.5% from 7.5%, to extend the maturity of the Notes to June 30, 2010, from June 30, 2007, and to provide the holder of the Notes with a one-time right to require PG&E Corporation to repurchase the Notes on June 30, 2007 at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (including any liquidated damages and pass-through dividends, if any).

W I T N E S S E T H:           WHEREAS, the Borrower is a party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2002 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Existing Credit Agreement"), with the lenders party thereto, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent, and others, pursuant to which such lenders made the Tranche A Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, the "Existing Tranche A Loan") and the Tranche B Loan (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, the "Existing Tranche B Loan");           WHEREAS, the parties hereto wish to amend and restate the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety to modify certain of the terms applicable to the Existing Tranche B Loan, to reflect the repayment of the Existing Tranche A Loan and to provide for the making of an additional Tranche B Loan to the Borrower; and           WHEREAS, (i) the Existing Credit Agreement is being amended and restated pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) certain indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated in connection with this Agreement, will be continued under this Agreement and (iii) all obligations of the Borrower, LLC and NEG, Inc. under the Financing Documents (as such term is defined herein) and all liens and security interests created under the Financing Documents will be continued, amended and restated as provided herein and therein and will not be cancelled or discharged;           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, the parties hereto agree that, upon the Closing Date, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:           SECTION 1.   DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF INTERPRETATION.             1.1   Defined Terms.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and its Schedules and Exhibits shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Appendix A hereto.           1.2   Rules of Interpretation.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the rules of interpretation set forth in Appendix A hereto shall apply to this Agreement.           1.3   Accounting Principles.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all computations and determinations as to financial matters, and all financial statements to be delivered under this Agreement shall be made or prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (including principles of consolidation where appropriate) applied on a consistent basis (except to the extent approved or required by the independent public accountants certifying such statements and disclosed therein).           SECTION 2.   AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF CREDIT FACILITY.             2.1   Existing Loans; the New Tranche B Commitment.  (a)  Prior to the date hereof, the Existing Tranche A Loan was repaid in full.  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, on the Closing Date, (i)  the Existing Tranche B Loan shall be continued as a loan hereunder (the "Continued Tranche B Loan"), which shall mature on the Tranche B Maturity Date, and (ii) (A) each New Tranche B Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the New Tranche B Commitment of such Lender and (B) the Administrative Agent shall transfer such amount to the Tranche B Escrow Account (from which such amount shall be released (x) to the Borrower on the Escrow Release Date, if the Escrow Release Date occurs, and upon such release such amount shall constitute term loans (collectively, the "New Tranche B Loan") made by each New Tranche B Lender to the Borrower in an amount equal to the amount of the New Tranche B Commitment of such Lender or (y) to the Administrative Agent, to be returned to each New Tranche B Lender ratably in accordance with the amounts made available by the New Tranche B Lenders to the Administrative Agent on the Closing Date, if the Bankruptcy Termination Event occurs, in which case no New Tranche B Loans shall be made).  The New Tranche B Loans (A) shall be denominated in Dollars, (B) shall be incurred and maintained as Eurodollar Loans, except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2.7(b) and (C) shall mature on the Tranche B Maturity Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate principal amount of the Continued Tranche B Loan and the New Tranche B Loan outstanding on the Escrow Release Date (after giving effect to the release of funds from the Tranche B Escrow Account on the Escrow Release Date, but without giving effect to any pay-in-kind interest pursuant to Section 2.5(g)) shall be $420,000,000 and $300,000,000, respectively.           (b)   If the Closing Date has not occurred on or prior to October 18, 2002, then, in such event, (i) except as set forth in clause (ii) below, the Lenders shall have no further obligations or liabilities under any of the Financing Documents and the Financing Documents shall have no further force or effect with respect to the Lenders, but the Borrower's obligation to pay the costs, fees and expenses as provided herein and to indemnify the other parties to the Financing Documents shall not be terminated, modified or diminished in any respect, and (ii) the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Existing Financing Documents shall remain in full force and effect, and no modification thereof shall have been made pursuant hereto.           (c)   The Loans are available only on the terms and conditions specified hereunder, and once repaid, in whole or in part, at maturity or by prepayment, may not be reborrowed in whole or in part.           (d)   The Continued Tranche B Loan and the New Tranche B Loan shall be separate and distinct loans that shall have identical terms except as expressly set forth in the Financing Documents.             2.2   Notice  of  Funding.    The  Borrower  shall  give  the Administrative Agent prior notice requesting the funding by each New Tranche B Lender to the Administrative Agent of an amount equal to the New Tranche Commitment of such New Tranche B Lender, provided that any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if given before 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on such day.  Such notice (the "Notice of Funding") shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, in the form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed to specify the aggregate principal amount of the New Tranche B Commitments to be funded, and the date selected to be the Closing Date (which shall be a Business Day).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the New Tranche B Lenders of the contents of such Notice of Funding.           2.3   Disbursement of Funds.  No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the Closing Date, each New Tranche B Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's pro rata share of the amount of the amount requested in the Notice of Funding.  Such amounts will be transferred by the Administrative Agent to the Tranche B Escrow Account.           2.4   Notes.  (a)  The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Continued Tranche B Loan and the New Tranche Loan made by a Lender shall be evidenced by promissory notes duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "Note").           (b)   The Notes issued to a Lender shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to such Lender or its Assignee and be dated the date of issuance thereof, (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Loan made or continued by, or assigned to, such Lender, as the case may be, and be payable in the outstanding principal amount of the Loan evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the Tranche B Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 2.5 in respect of a Base Rate Loan (if converted pursuant to Section 2.7(b)) or a Eurodollar Loan, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in Section 3.1, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 3.2, and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents.             (c)   Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of the Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of its Notes endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of the Loan evidenced thereby.  Failure to make any such notation or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loan.           2.5   Interest.  (a)  The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of any Base Rate Loan from the date of conversion thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(b) until the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate each as in effect from time to time.           (b)   The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date of Borrowing or conversion thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.7(b) at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.           (c)   Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable by the Borrower shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then borne by such Loan.  Interest which accrues under this Section 2.5(c) shall be payable on demand.           (d)   Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, (x) quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date, (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment of the outstanding principal amount of such Base Rate Loan, and (z) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand, and (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, (x) on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand (each such date upon which interest shall be payable, an "Interest Payment Date").           (e)   Upon each Interest Determination Date with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for the relevant Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan and shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof.  Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.           (f)   (i)  Until the Consolidation Date, upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Continued Tranche B Loan, if the Borrower does not on such Interest Payment Date pay the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Continued Tranche B Loan, the amount of such interest shall be withdrawn from the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account (Continued Tranche B Loan) and applied to pay such interest.  The Continued Tranche B Lenders hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to request such withdrawal under the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement (Continued Tranche B Loan) and to pay such interest.            (ii)  Until the Consolidation Date, upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of the New Tranche B Loan, if the Borrower does not on such Interest Payment Date pay the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the New Tranche B Loan, the amount of such interest shall be withdrawn from the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account (New Tranche B Loan) and applied to pay such interest.  The New Tranche B Lenders hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to request such withdrawal under the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement (New Tranche B Loan) and to pay such interest.           (iii)  On or after the Consolidation Date, upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche B Loan, if the Borrower does not on such Interest Payment Date pay the amount of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Tranche B Loan, the amount of such interest shall be withdrawn from the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account (Combined Tranche B Loan) and applied to pay such interest.  The Tranche B Lenders hereby authorize and direct the Collateral Agent to request such withdrawal under the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement (Combined Tranche B Loan) and to pay such interest.           (g)   Upon each Interest Payment Date in respect of any portion of the Tranche B Loan, in addition to the interest payable in cash as described above, the principal amount of such portion will be increased by a pay-in-kind interest amount calculated on the principal amount of such portion at the rate per annum of 4.00% for the period from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date with respect to such portion to the current Interest Payment Date, and such increased principal amount of the Tranche B Loan shall thereafter bear interest (both cash-pay and pay-in-kind) at the same rates as the original principal amount of the Tranche B Loan.  For purposes of this paragraph (g), the Escrow Release Date shall be deemed to be an Interest Payment Date in respect of the New Tranche B Loan, and pay-in- kind interest in respect of the New Tranche B Loan shall accrue from the Closing Date.           2.6   Interest Periods.  At the time the Borrower gives the Notice of Funding, or prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrower shall have the right to elect the interest period (each an "Interest Period") applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three or six-month period; provided that (in each case):           (i)   the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan shall      commence on the date of Borrowing or conversion of such Eurodollar Loan      and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such      Eurodollar Loan shall commence on the day on which the next preceding      Interest Period applicable thereto expires;           (ii)   if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan begins on a      day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar      month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall      end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;           (iii)   if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would      otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest      Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided,      however, that if any Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan would      otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of      the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,      such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;           (iv)   no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a      Default or an Event of Default is then in existence;           (v)   no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of any      Eurodollar Loan shall be selected which extends beyond the Tranche B      Maturity Date; and           (vi)   on the Closing Date, the Interest Period in respect of the      Continued Tranche B Loan shall expire (subject to payment by the      Borrower of any breakage costs pursuant to Section 2.8, determined as      if the expiration of such existing Interest Period on the Closing Date      were a prepayment made on the Closing Date), and the next Interest      Period selected on or after the Closing Date shall end on the first      Business Day which occurs on or after the date which is 91 days after      the Closing Date. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Loan, the Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loan as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected a one-month Interest Period effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.  For purposes of calculating the funding fee payable pursuant to Paragraph 4 of the Escrow Agreement, such funding fee shall be calculated as if an Interest Period in respect of the New Tranche B Loan began on the Closing Date and ended on the first Business Day to occur on or after the date which is 91 days after the Closing Date.           2.7   Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.  (a)  In the event that a Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):           (i)   on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any      changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the      interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for      ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in      the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or            (ii)   at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs      or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with      respect to any Eurodollar Loan of such Lender because of (x) any change      since the Closing Date in any applicable law or governmental rule,      regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the      force of law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof and      including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule,      regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for example, but not      limited to:  (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payment to such      Lender of the principal of or interest on such Lender's Loan or Note or      any other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder (except for changes      in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or      net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in      which it is doing business, organized or in which its principal office      or applicable lending office is located or any subdivision thereof or      therein) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all      events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent      included in the computation of the Eurodollar Rate and/or (y) other      circumstances (other than with respect to taxes) arising since the      Closing Date affecting such Lender (or its Source), the interbank      Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such market; or           (iii)   at any time, that the making or continuance of any      Eurodollar Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental      rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by such Lender      in good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having      force of law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency      occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affects      the interbank Eurodollar market; then, and in any such event, such Lender shall promptly give notice (by telephone  promptly  confirmed  in  writing)  to  the  Borrower  of  such determination.  Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as such Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Lender no longer exist, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon such Lender's written request therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.7(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by Law.           Each Lender, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower (including, but not limited to, such Lender's internal costs for use of its personnel and resources), will use its reasonable efforts to minimize taxes indemnifiable by the Borrower under this Section 2.7(a), including by complying with reasonable requests by the Borrower to do or to refrain from doing any act (including the execution of any certificates or similar documents required to establish an exemption or relief from any tax), if such efforts or any such compliance is, in the good faith discretion of such Lender, of a purely ministerial nature and has no adverse impact on such Lender or any Affiliate or on the business or operations of the foregoing (unless such adverse impact is one of a nature and quality such that it is subject to indemnification and the Borrower has indemnified such Lender against such adverse impact in a manner satisfactory to such Lender determined in its sole discretion).  The Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any taxes that may be imposed on it as a consequence of such compliance.           (b)   At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.7(a)(i) or (ii), the Borrower may, and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.7(a)(iii), the Borrower shall, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to such Lender, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan.           (c)   If a Lender determines that after the Closing Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender (or its Source) or any corporation controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of capital.  In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable, provided that such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this Section 2.7(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.  Such Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.           2.8   Compensation.  The Borrower agrees to compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loan but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain:  (i) if any prepayment or repayment (including any prepayment or repayment made pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.8 or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2) or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan is made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; or (ii) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Loan when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 2.7(b).           SECTION 3.   PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS; TAXES.           3.1   Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Tranche B Loan, ratably, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time on the following terms and conditions:  the Borrower shall give each affected Lender prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) (x) at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay a Base Rate Loan and (y) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay a Eurodollar Loan, which notice (in each case) shall specify the amount of such prepayment which shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $10,000,000, and minimum increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; provided that, the Tranche B Loan may not be prepaid until after all amounts payable to each Holder under the Option Agreement in respect of any Put Notice (as defined in the Option Agreement) theretofore delivered by such Holder.  Each prepayment of the Tranche B Loan made pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be accompanied by payment of a prepayment fee equal to (i) if such prepayment is made on or prior to October 1, 2003, the Voluntary Make-Whole Amount, (ii) if such prepayment is made after October 1, 2003 and on or prior to October 1, 2004, 2.5% of the principal amount prepaid and (iii) if such prepayment is made after October 1, 2004, 0.5% of the principal amount prepaid, which fee shall be distributed among each Tranche B Lender ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Tranche B Loan held by such Tranche B Lender.           3.2   Mandatory Repayments.

(m)   Nothing in this Section 3.2 shall limit any other rights or remedies a Lender may have under Section 8 of this Agreement or under applicable law in connection with any Event of Default.           3.3   Method and Place of Payment.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement and under any Note shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders entitled thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Payment Office or pursuant to such other instruction as the Administrative Agent shall designate to the Borrower in writing.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable rate during such extension.           3.4   Net Payments.  (a)  All payments made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder and under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.  Except as provided in Section 3.4(b), all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is doing business, organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as "Taxes").  If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note.  If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender, for taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is doing business, organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is doing business, organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall reasonably determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence.  The Borrower will furnish to such Lender within 45 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by such Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.           (b)   Any Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.11(a) (unless such Assignee was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment in which case such assignee shall reaffirm its ability to deliver the forms set forth below in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable), on the date of the assignment to such Assignee, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if any such Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C (any such certificate, a "Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note.  In addition, each such Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender will deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or such Lender shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section 3.4(b).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.4(a) but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.4(a) to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 3.4, the Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.4(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes that are effective after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of such Taxes.  The sole consequence of any Lender failing to comply with the requirement to deliver the Internal Revenue Service Forms or the Section 3.4(b)(ii) Certificate shall be that the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.4(a) to gross-up payments to be made to such Lender in respect of any resulting U.S. income or similar taxes.           (c)   Any Lender that is (i) an Assignee pursuant to Section 9.11(a) and (ii) not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes will certify to the Borrower on or prior to the date of the assignment to such Lender that payments to such Lender hereunder and under any Note are, as of the date of such assignment, not subject to any withholding tax imposed by any taxing jurisdiction located outside of the United States.           (d)   Each Lender, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower (including, but not limited to, the Lender's internal costs for use of its personnel and resources), will use its reasonable efforts to minimize taxes indemnifiable by the Borrower under this Section 3.4, including by complying with reasonable requests by the Borrower to do or to refrain from doing any act (including the execution of any certificates or similar documents required to establish an exemption or relief from any tax), if such efforts or any such compliance is, in the good faith discretion of such Lender, of a purely ministerial nature and has no adverse impact on such Lender or any Affiliate or on the business or operations of the foregoing (unless such adverse impact is one of a nature and quality such that it is subject to indemnification and the Borrower has indemnified such Lender against such adverse impact in a manner satisfactory to such Lender determined in its sole discretion).  The Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any taxes that may be imposed on it as a consequence of such compliance.  No Lender shall be required to disclose any tax return or filing or any related information it deems confidential and all positions taken by each Lender in any tax return, filing or proceeding shall be within the sole control of such Lender.           3.5   Allocation.  The parties agree that the Notes issued by the Borrower to the New Tranche B Lenders under this Agreement and the New Warrants issued by the Borrower to the New Tranche B Lenders under the New Warrant Agreement will, for federal tax purposes, be treated as an "investment unit" as such term is defined under Section 1273(c)(2) of the Code and the parties agree that the consideration paid by each New Tranche B Lender for its Note and New Warrants shall be allocated as set forth on Schedule 3.5.           3.6   [OMITTED].           3.7   Application of Payments; Sharing.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Section 3.7, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations of the Borrower hereunder, it shall promptly distribute such payment to the Lenders pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.             (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to particular Lenders or to Lenders holding a particular Loan, if it should receive any payment hereunder on account of the Obligations (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Financing Documents, or otherwise), which, in any such case, is in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Obligations obtained by all Lenders, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all the Lenders in such amount; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, in the event that (i) during the period between the Closing Date and the date which is 91 days after the Closing Date, an Event of Default occurs under Section 8.1(e) and (ii) during the proceeding constituting such Event of Default any payment made by the Borrower in respect of either the Continued Tranche B Loan or the New Tranche B Loan, as the case may be, prior to the commencement of any such proceeding is avoided or otherwise recovered pursuant to Sections 547 and 550 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any lien granted by the Borrower prior to the commencement of any such proceeding to secure either the Continued Tranche B Loan or the New Tranche B Loan, as the case may be, is avoided or otherwise recovered pursuant to Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code,  then, in any such case, solely for purposes of this paragraph, such payment or such lien shall be deemed not to have been avoided or recovered, and (for greater certainty) any amount that would have been received in respect of the Continued Tranche B Loan or the New Tranche B Loan, as the case may be, if such lien had not been so avoided shall be deemed to have been received and not avoided.  Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, all proceeds of the Tranche B Escrow Account (including all substitutions and replacements therefor) shall be applied solely to the New Tranche B Loan ratably among the New Tranche B Lenders according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the New Tranche B Loan held by the New Tranche B Lenders, and shall not be shared with the Continued Tranche B Lenders on account of the Continued Tranche B Loan.           3.8   Offers to Repay.  (a)  Upon a Change of Control, the Borrower shall prepare and provide to each Lender an Offer to Repay Notice, which shall include an offer (the "Change of Control Offer to Repay") to prepay on the date (each, a "Change of Control Offer Settlement Date") that is ten (10) Business Days after the date of the Offer to Repay Notice, such Lender's Loan, together with a prepayment fee (the "Change of Control Prepayment Fee") equal to 1.5% of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's Loan, and each Lender wishing to accept the Change of Control Offer to Repay (which shall be determined by such Lender in its sole discretion) shall reply, in the form of Exhibit E-2, indicating whether such offer is accepted or rejected in whole or in part (and if so, to what extent) by the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Change of Control Offer Settlement Date, failing which such offer will be deemed to have been accepted in whole by such Lender and such repayment will be made by the Borrower to such Lender.  On the Change of Control Offer Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to those Lenders who have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Change of Control Offer to Repay the aggregate amount necessary to prepay that portion of the outstanding Loans, together with the Change of Control Prepayment Fee, in respect of which such Lenders have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Change of Control Offer to Repay in accordance with this Section 3.8(a).           (b)   Not later than 45 days prior to the date (the "Spin-Off Date") of any Spin-Off, the Borrower shall prepare and provide to each Lender an Offer to Repay Notice, which shall include an offer (the "Spin Offer to Repay") to prepay on a date (each, a "Spin Offer Settlement Date") that is on or before the Spin-Off Date, such Lender's Loan, together with a prepayment fee (the "Spin Prepayment Fee") equal to the Put Prepayment Fee Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's Loan, and each Lender wishing to accept the Spin Offer to Repay (which shall be determined by such Lender in its sole discretion) shall reply, in the form of Exhibit E-2, indicating whether such offer is accepted or rejected in whole or in part (and if so, to what extent) by the close of business on the date that is ten (10) days after the date of receipt of the Offer to Repay Notice by such Lender, failing which such offer will be deemed to have been accepted in whole by such Lender and such repayment will be made by the Borrower to such Lender.  On the Spin Offer Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to those Lenders who have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Spin Offer to Repay the aggregate amount necessary to prepay that portion of the outstanding Loans, together with the Spin Prepayment Fee, in respect of which such Lenders have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Spin Offer to Repay in accordance with this Section 3.8(b); provided, that in the event that both (1) the PGE Plan is confirmed and (2) immediately upon the consummation of the Newco Spin, the Borrower has delivered to the Collateral Agent the stock certificates representing the common stock of Newco received by the Borrower in the Newco Spin such that the Lenders shall have a perfected first priority security interest in the common stock of Newco pursuant to the Utility Pledge Agreements, the Spin-Off Date shall be deemed to be the earlier of (i) the date of the PGE Spin and (ii) the date 30 days after the date of the Newco Spin.  For avoidance of doubt, no Spin-Off shall be permitted prior to the prepayment of all amounts owing to Lenders that accept the Borrower's Spin Offer to Repay in accordance with this Section 3.8(b).           (c)   Upon and after the confirmation of any Non-Spin Plan of Reorganization, if on any Test Date the Post-Confirmation Market Value to Loan Ratio is less than 85% of the Pre-Closing Market Value to Loan Ratio, then, not later than 5 Business Days after such Test Date, the Borrower shall prepare and provide to each Lender an Offer to Repay Notice, which shall include an offer (the "Non-Spin Offer to Repay") to prepay on a date (each, a "Non-Spin Offer Settlement Date") that is on or before the date twenty-five (25) Business Days after the date of the Offer to Repay Notice, such Lender's Loan, together with a prepayment fee (the "Non-Spin Prepayment Fee") equal to the Put Prepayment Fee Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's Loan, and each Lender wishing to accept the Non-Spin Offer to Repay (which shall be determined by such Lender in its sole discretion) shall reply, in the form of Exhibit E-2, indicating whether such offer is accepted or rejected in whole or in part (and if so, to what extent) by the close of business on the date that is ten (10) days after the date of receipt of the Offer to Repay Notice by such Lender, failing which such offer will be deemed to have been accepted in whole by such Lender and such repayment will be made by the Borrower to such Lender.  On the Non-Spin Offer Settlement Date, the Borrower shall pay to those Lenders who have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Non-Spin Offer to Repay the aggregate amount necessary to prepay that portion of the outstanding Loans, together with the Non-Spin Prepayment Fee, in respect of which such Lenders have accepted (or are deemed to have accepted) the Non-Spin Offer to Repay in accordance with this Section 3.8(c).

The amount of such Indebtedness or other obligations not listed on Schedule 5.31(b) as of August 31, 2002 does not exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate.

To the extent that any undertaking in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 9.2 may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower will contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of such undertaking.           (e)   Settlement.  So long as the Borrower is in compliance with its obligations under this Section 9.2, the Borrower shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person under this Section 9.2 for any settlement made by such Indemnified Person without the Borrower's consent.

The assigning Lender and the Assignee shall enter into an assignment agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), with respect to the sale or assignment of the Loan to be assigned and, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 9.11, upon execution and delivery of such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to effect the addition of the Assignee, and any reference to the assigning Lender hereunder or under the other Financing Documents shall thereafter refer to such Lender and to the Assignee to the extent of their respective interests, and (ii) the assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment agreement, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under the Financing Documents.

(c)   A Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.11, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender.           (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Financing Document to the contrary, any Lender may assign all or any portion of the Loan held by it as collateral security, provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loan or Note made by the Borrower to or for the account of the assigning or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect to such assigned Loan or Note to the extent of such payment.  No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.           (e)   The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this Section 9.11, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.  Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans.  With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.  The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 9.11(a).

On or prior to such effective date, the Borrower, at its own expense, upon request, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (in exchange for the Note of the assigning Lender) a new Note to the order of such Assignee in an amount equal to the Loan acquired by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if such assigning Lender has retained a Loan, a new Note to the order of such assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Loan retained by it hereunder.           9.12   Survival.    (a)  All  indemnities  set  forth  herein, including, without limitation, Section 9.2, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making and repayment of the Loans.  In addition, each representation and warranty made or deemed to be made pursuant hereto shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and no Lender shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any extension of credit, any Default or Event of Default which may arise by reason of such representation or warranty proving to have been false or misleading, notwithstanding that such Lender may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time such extension of credit was made.           (b)   Notwithstanding  the  execution  and  delivery  of  this Agreement, all representations and warranties of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Financing Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and all obligations of the Borrower under Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of the Existing Credit Agreement and other payment obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.2 and 3.4 of the Existing Credit Agreement accrued as of the Closing Date shall not terminate and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents (as defined herein).           9.13   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY RELATING HERETO OR THERETO.  THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE LENDERS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.           9.14   Right of Set-off.  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable Law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including without limitation by branches and agencies of such Lender wherever located), to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations or liabilities of the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Financing Document, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured.           9.15   Severability.  Any provision hereof which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof and without affecting the validity or enforceability of any provision in any other jurisdiction.           9.16   Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  (a)  THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OF THE OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENTS (UNLESS SUCH DOCUMENT EXPRESSLY STATES OTHERWISE THEREIN) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW RULES THEREOF (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW).

The Borrower further agrees that the aforesaid courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any claim or counterclaim of the Borrower based upon the assertion that the rate of interest charged by or under this Agreement or under the other Financing Documents is usurious.  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Borrower further irrevocably agrees to the service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Borrower at the address referenced in Section 9.3, such service to be effective upon the date indicated on the postal receipt returned from the Borrower.

(a)  Concurrently with the consummation of a Qualified NEG Sale, the Lenders agree to cause the Collateral Agent (at the expense of the Borrower) to release the security interest held by the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the Stock Pledge Agreement or the LLC Pledge Agreement, as the case may be, in the Capital Stock being sold in such Qualified NEG Sale (so long as the Borrower complies with the requirements of Section 3.2(g)).           (b)   Concurrently with the consummation of a Spin-Off or a public offering of the common stock of PGE Utility in accordance with Section 7.2(xi), the Lenders agree to cause the Collateral Agent (at the expense of the Borrower) to release the security interest held by the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the Utility Pledge Agreements, in the Capital Stock of PGE Utility being disposed of in such Spin-Off or public offering (so long as the Borrower complies with the requirements of Section 3.8 or 3.2(d), as applicable).           9.25   Delivery of Lender Addendum.  Each Tranche B Lender becoming a party hereto on the Closing Date shall become a party hereto by delivery to the Administrative Agent a Lender Addendum duly executed by such Tranche B Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.           9.26   Special Exculpation.  NO CLAIM MAY BE MADE BY THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON AGAINST THE COLLATERAL AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR THE AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS OR AGENTS OF ANY OF THEM FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH AND THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES NOT TO SUE UPON ANY CLAIM FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR.            9.27   Intercreditor Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that this Agreement and the other Financing Documents are not intended to amend the Intercreditor Agreement or to affect any or the rights or remedies pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement of the parties thereto.  To the extent that provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement affects the rights and remedies of the holders of the Existing Tranche B Loan, nothing herein or in any other Financing Document shall be deemed to modify such provisions, nor shall anything herein or in any other Financing Document subject the New Tranche B Loan, or the holders thereof, or any security interest created pursuant to the Security Agreements, the Utility Pledge Agreements or the Tranche B Interest Reserve Account Control Agreement (New Tranche B Loan), to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.             9.28   Amended and Restated Security Documents.  If no Default or Event of Default under Section 8.1(e) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date which is 91 days after the Closing Date, the parties hereto hereby authorize and direct the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent as promptly as practicable thereafter to enter into amendments and restatements of the Security Agreements, the Utility Pledge Agreements and the Tranche B Reserve Account Control Agreements, in such form as the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall agree upon (but in all cases to be substantially similar to the existing documents), in each case to cause the New Tranche B Loan and the Continued Tranche B Loan to be equally and ratably secured by the Collateral covered by such Security Documents, without any distinction between the New Tranche B Loan and the Continued Tranche B Loan (the date upon which such amended and restated Security Documents shall become effective, the "Consolidation Date").  In connection with such amendment and restatement, the Borrower shall cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, such legal opinions as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request in respect of such amended and restated Security Documents.  No further consent of the Lenders to any such amendments and restatements shall be required.           9.29   Consent to Convertible Note Amendment.  Each Lender consents to the amendment to the Convertible Notes and the Convertible Notes Indenture described in Section 4.1(v), a copy of which has been provided to the Lenders.           SECTION 10.   THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; THE SYNDICATION AGENT, THE LEAD ARRANGER AND THE BOOKRUNNER.             10.1   Appointment.  Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. shall be the Administrative Agent and shall act as specified herein and in the other Financing Documents.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and the holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other Financing Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents or employees.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute, deliver and perform each Security Document and such Lender agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of the Administrative Agent contained in the Security Documents.           10.2   Nature of Duties.  The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Security Documents.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Financing Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or by reason of the use of the term "agent" with reference to the Administrative Agent, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Financing Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other Financing Document except as expressly set forth herein.           10.3   Lack  of  Reliance  on  the  Administrative  Agent.  Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender, each Lender and each holder of any Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Borrower, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall not be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Financing Document or the financial condition of the Borrower or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or the financial condition of the Borrower or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.           10.4   Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent.  If the Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the Required Waiver Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Financing Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Waiver Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or the holder of any Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Financing Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Waiver Lenders.           10.5   Reliance.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Financing Document its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.           10.6   Indemnification.  To the extent the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in proportion to its respective Loan, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,  claims,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Financing Document, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Financing Document; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.           10.7   The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.  With respect to its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, and with respect to any Loan held by it or made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the term "Lender," "Required Waiver Lenders", "holder of Note" or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.             10.8   Holders.  The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.           10.9   Resignation or Replacement of the Administrative Agent.  (a)  The Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other Financing Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Borrower and each Lender.  Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (c) and (d) below or as otherwise provided below.           (b)   The Administrative Agent may be replaced at the written request of the Required Waiver Lenders at any time by such Lenders giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent.  Such replacement shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (c) and (d) below or as otherwise provided below.            (c)   Upon any such notice of resignation or replacement, as the case may be, the Required Waiver Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other financial institution which is a Lender and which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall be continuing).           (d)   If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Waiver Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.           (e)   If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to clause (c) or (d) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of resignation or replacement was given by the Administrative Agent or the Required Waiver Lenders, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent's resignation or replacement shall become effective and the Required Waiver Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any other Financing Document until such time, if any, as the Required Waiver Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.           10.10   The Syndication Agent, Lead Arranger and Bookrunner.  None of the Syndication Agent, the Lead Arranger or the Bookrunner, in such respective capacity, shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Financing Document, nor shall any of such Persons, in such respective capacities, have any obligations or liabilities hereunder or under any other Financing Document.           10.11   Direction to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent.  Each of the Lenders authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver the Security Documents and to perform their respective obligations thereunder.  Each Lender agrees that it is bound by the provisions in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Lenders to the same extent as if such Lender were a party thereto, including, without limitation, any provisions of the Security Documents requiring the Lenders to indemnify the Collateral Agent.  The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are express third-party beneficiaries of this Section.           SECTION 11.   COLLATERAL AGENT.           11.1   Appointment.  Each Lender hereby appoints, designates and authorizes the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Security Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of any Security Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Each Lender authorizes the Collateral Agent to execute, deliver and perform each of the Security Documents and such Lender agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of the Collateral Agent contained in the Security Documents.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Security Documents, the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Security Documents, and the Collateral Agent does not have or shall not be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with  any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the Security Documents or otherwise exist against the Collateral Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "Collateral Agent," in this Agreement with reference to the Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a relationship between independent contracting parties.             11.2   Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Collateral Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with any Security Document or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders or any other Person for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained in any Security Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Collateral Agent under or in connection with, any Security Document, or for the value of or title to any Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of any Security Document, or for any failure of any Covered Party or any other party to any Security Document to perform its obligations thereunder.  The Collateral Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, any Security Document, or to inspect the books or records of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower.  Anything in this Agreement or any Security Document to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to loss of profits).           11.3   Reliance by Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively, and shall be fully protected in so relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Security Document (i) if such action would, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent (upon consultation with counsel), be contrary to applicable Law or the terms of any Security Document, (ii) if such action is not specifically provided for in the Security Documents and it shall not have received such written advice or concurrence of the Required Waiver Lenders, in each case as the Collateral Agent deems appropriate, (iii) unless, if it so requests, such Collateral Agent shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Security Documents in accordance with a written request or written consent of the Required Waiver Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.           11.4   Notice of Default.  The Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to the Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".  If the Collateral Agent receives any such notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, it shall give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  The Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested in writing by the Required Waiver Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the Collateral Agent has received any such request, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default under the Security Documents as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.           11.5   Indemnification.    Whether  or  not  the  transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Collateral Agent, its officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys in fact ("Agent Related Person") (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower within 90 days of the Collateral Agent's request to the Borrower for payment and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), pro rata in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by such Lenders (as determined by the Administrative Agent), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Collateral Agent or the Agent Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Collateral Agent upon demand as provided above of any costs or out-of- pocket expenses incurred by such Collateral Agent or Agent Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower within 90 days of the Collateral Agent's request to the Borrower for payment and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Security Documents or any document contemplated by or referred to therein, pro rata in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by such Lenders (as determined by the Administrative Agent).  The provisions of this section shall survive termination of the Security Documents or earlier resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent.           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to set off from any Collateral or proceeds thereof any amounts due and owing to it pursuant to this Section 11.5 solely to the extent such amounts are not paid by the Borrower or the Lenders as provided in the Security Documents and such amounts remain unpaid by the Lenders for a period of thirty days after demand therefor.           11.6   Successor Collateral Agent.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor as provided below, the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Collateral Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Waiver Lenders upon thirty (30) days prior written notice.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Waiver Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor to the Collateral Agent.  If no successor Collateral Agent shall have been appointed by the Required Waiver Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Collateral Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the giving of any notice of removal of such Collateral Agent, then the resigning Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent being removed, as the case may be, may at the Borrower's expense, appoint a successor to such Collateral Agent or petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a successor.  If the Collateral Agent shall resign or be removed pursuant to the foregoing provisions, upon the acceptance of appointment by a successor Collateral Agent hereunder, the former Collateral Agent shall deliver all Collateral then in its possession to the successor Collateral Agent.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as a successor Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such resigning or removed Collateral Agent, and such resigning Collateral Agent or removed Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Security Documents.            11.7   Miscellaneous.  (a)    None of the provisions of the Security Documents shall require the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur any liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties thereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured to it.           (b)   The Collateral Agent may execute any of the trusts or powers or perform any duties under any Security Document either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians or nominees appointed with due care, and shall not be responsible for any willful misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed.           (c)    Any corporation into which the Collateral Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the Collateral Agent shall be the successor of the Collateral Agent under the Security Documents without the execution or filing of any paper with any party to the Security Documents or any further act on the part of any of the parties to the Security Documents except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.           (d)   The Collateral Agent shall not take any instructions with respect to the Security Documents from any entity that is not a Lender hereunder.           IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their duly authorized officers to execute and deliver this Agreement as of the date first above written.

The Pledgee shall also be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:             (i)  all other or additional capital stock or other property      (including, but not limited to, cash dividends other than as set forth      above) paid or distributed by way of dividend or otherwise in respect      of the Collateral;                 (ii) all other or additional capital stock or other property paid      or distributed in respect of the Collateral by way of split, spin-off,      split-up, reclassification, combination or similar rearrangement;                 (iii)     all other or additional capital stock or other property      (including, but not limited to, cash) which may be paid in respect of      the Collateral by reason of any consolidation, merger, exchange,       conveyance of assets, liquidation or similar reorganization; and                 (iv) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all shares      of Newco Stock distributed in respect of the Collateral.            Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit or restrict in any way the Pledgee's right to have pledged to it proceeds of the Collateral in any form in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.  All dividends, distributions or other payments which are received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6 and Section 7 hereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Pledgee, shall be segregated from other property or funds of the Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).        7.   REMEDIES IN CASE OF DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT. Subject to the Credit Agreement, if there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this Agreement, any other Financing Document or by law) for the protection and enforcement of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction and also shall be entitled, without limitation, to exercise the following rights:           (i)  to receive all amounts payable in respect of the Collateral;             (ii) upon receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals, to transfer all or any part of the Collateral into the Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or nominees;              (iii)     upon receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals, to vote all or any part of the Collateral (whether or not transferred into the name of the Pledgee) and give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the Collateral and otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof (the Pledgor hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee the proxy and attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor, with full power of substitution to do so) and to exercise any and all of the rights or powers of the Pledgor in its capacity as a stockholder of the Issuer;             (iv) at any time and from time to time to sell, assign and deliver, or grant options to purchase, all or any part of the Collateral, or any interest therein, at any public or private sale, without demand of performance, advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of the time or place of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem or otherwise (all of which are hereby waived by the Pledgor to the extent permitted by applicable Law), for cash, on credit or for other property, for immediate or future delivery without any assumption of credit risk, and for such price or prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute discretion  
  may determine, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.  The Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any such sale of Collateral regardless of whether any notice of sale has theretofore been given.  The Pledgor hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by law any right or equity of redemption with respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale hereunder (other than the right to pay the Secured Obligations in full), and all rights, if any, of marshalling the Collateral and any other security for the Secured Obligations or otherwise.  At any such sale, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Pledgee may bid for and purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold free from any such right or equity of redemption.  The Pledgee shall not be liable for failure to collect or realize upon any or all of the Collateral or for any delay in so doing nor shall any of them be under any obligation to take any action whatsoever with regard thereto; and             (v)  to set-off any and all Collateral against any and all Secured Obligations and to apply such Collateral to the payment of any and all Secured Obligations.        If, pursuant to applicable Law, prior notice of any of the foregoing actions is required to be given to the Pledgee, the Pledgee hereby acknowledges that the minimum time required by such applicable Law, or if no minimum is specified, ten (10) days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period.        8.   REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE.  Each and every right, power and remedy of the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or in any other Financing Document, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or any other Financing Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.        9.   APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.  All monies collected by the Pledgee upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, together with all other monies received by the Pledgee hereunder, shall be applied at the written instruction of the Administrative Agent for satisfaction of the Secured Obligations in the order provided in the Credit Agreement.        10.  PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL.  Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt given by the Pledgee or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof.        11.  [OMITTED]        12.  CERTAIN LIMITATIONS  (a)  The Pledgee shall not be obligated to perform or discharge any obligation of the Pledgor as a result of the pledge hereby effected.    
       (b)  The acceptance by the Pledgee of this Agreement, with all the rights, powers, privileges and authority so created, shall not at any time or in any event obligate the Pledgee to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating to the Collateral to which it is not a party, or to take any action hereunder or thereunder, or to expend any money or incur any expenses or perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Collateral.        13.  FURTHER ASSURANCES; POWER-OF-ATTORNEY.  ii)  At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Pledgee, and at the sole expense of the Pledgor, the Pledgor will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments and documents and take such further action as the Pledgee reasonably may deem appropriate in order to perfect and preserve the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral and in order for the Pledgee to obtain the full benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted, including, without limitation, the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction and the filing of any other equivalent or similar statement or document under any other applicable Law with any other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to the security interests granted hereby.  The Pledgor also hereby authorizes the Pledgee to file any such financing or continuation statement without the signature of the Pledgor to the extent permitted by applicable Law.  If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or instrument shall be immediately delivered to the Pledgee and pledged to the Pledgee hereunder, duly endorsed, to the extent necessary, to the Pledgee.              (b)  The Pledgor hereby appoints the Pledgee such Pledgor's attorney- in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor or otherwise, to act from time to time, solely after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and subject to the Credit Agreement, in the Pledgee's reasonable discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument which the Pledgee may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement.        14.  [OMITTED]         15.  TRANSFER BY THE PLEDGOR.  The Pledgor will not sell or otherwise dispose of, grant any option with respect to, or mortgage, pledge or otherwise encumber any of the Collateral or any interest therein (except as may be permitted in accordance with the terms of the Financing Documents).        16.  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PLEDGOR.  iii)  The Pledgor represents, warrants and covenants that:             (i)  it is the legal, beneficial and record owner of, and has      good and marketable title to, all Collateral consisting of Pledged      Stock and it has all rights in the Collateral necessary for the      security interest purported to be created hereunder to attach      (subject, in each case, to no pledge, lien, security interest, charge,      option or other encumbrance whatsoever, except the liens and security      interests created by this Agreement);                  (ii) it has full power, authority and legal right to pledge all      the Collateral pledged by it pursuant to this Agreement;                  (iii)     this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and      delivered by the Pledgor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding      obligation of the Pledgor enforceable against the Pledgor in      accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the      enforceability hereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,  
       insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws generally      affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles (regardless of      whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law);                  (iv) except to the extent already obtained or made, no consent of      any other party (including, without limitation, any stockholder or      creditor of the Pledgor or the Issuer) and no consent, license,      permit, approval or authorization of, exemption by, notice or report      to, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental      Authority is required to be obtained by the Pledgor in connection with      (a) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, (b) the      validity or enforceability of this Agreement, (c) the perfection or      enforceability of the Pledgee's security interest in the Collateral or      (d) except for compliance with or as may be required by applicable      securities laws, the exercise by the Pledgee of any of its rights or      remedies provided herein; provided, that any Person acquiring the      voting securities of the Issuer or Newco may require prior approval      from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the California      Public Utilities Commission.                        (v)  the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement      will not violate any provision of any applicable Law or regulation or      of any order, judgment, writ, award or decree of any court, arbitrator      or Governmental Authority, domestic or foreign, applicable to the      Pledgor, or of the certificate of incorporation, operating agreement,      limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement or by-laws      of the Pledgor or of any securities or other interests issued by the      Pledgor or the Issuer, or of any mortgage, deed of trust, indenture,      lease, loan agreement, credit agreement or other material contract,      agreement or instrument or undertaking to which the Pledgor or the      Issuer is a party or by which any of its assets may be bound and will      not result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to      create or impose) any lien or encumbrance on any of the assets of the      Pledgor or the Issuer except as contemplated by this Agreement;                   (vi) all of the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock has been      duly and validly issued and acquired, is fully paid and non-assessable      and is subject to no options to purchase or similar rights; and                 (vii)     the pledge and collateral assignment to the Pledgee of      the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock, together with continued      possession by the Pledgee of any certificates, instruments, documents      or other writings evidencing the Pledged Stock and/or the making of      relevant filings or recordings and/or any other action required to be      taken in accordance with Section 3.2 (all of which have been made or      taken, as the case may be), creates in favor of the Pledgee a valid      and perfected first priority security interest in such Collateral, and      the proceeds thereof, subject to no prior Lien or encumbrance (other      than any Permitted Lien that is a non-consensual lien arising by      operation of law) or to any agreement purporting to grant to any third      party a Lien or encumbrance (other than any Permitted Lien that is a      non-consensual lien arising by operation of law, and other than the      Lien created by the Utility Stock Pledge Agreement (35%)  New Tranche      B Loan) on the property or assets of the Pledgor which would include      the Pledged Stock and the Pledgee is entitled to all the rights,      priorities and benefits afforded by the Uniform Commercial Code or      other relevant law as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction to      perfected security interests in respect of such Collateral.             (b)  The Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will defend the Pledgee's right, title and security interest in and to the Collateral and the proceeds thereof against the claims and demands of all persons whomsoever; and the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will have like title to and right to pledge any other property at any time hereafter  
  pledged to the Pledgee as Collateral hereunder and will likewise defend the right thereto and security interest therein of the Pledgee.        17.  JURISDICTION OF ORGANIZATION; NAME.    The Pledgor's name, jurisdiction of organization and identification number are set forth in Annex B hereto.  The Pledgor will not change its name or its jurisdiction of organization, except upon 15 days' prior written notice to the Collateral Agent and delivery to the Collateral Agent of all additional executed financing statements and other documents reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the security interests provided for herein.         18.  PLEDGOR'S OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC.  The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever (except as provided under Section 20), including, without limitation:  (i) any renewal, extension, amendment or modification of or addition or supplement to or deletion from any Financing Document or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or transfer of any thereof; (ii) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument including, without limitation, this Agreement; (iii) any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or its assignee or any acceptance thereof or any release of any security by the Pledgee or its assignee (except as provided under Section 20); (iv) any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under any such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof; or (v) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to the Pledgor or the Issuer, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding, whether or not the Pledgor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing.        19.  REGISTRATION, ETC.  (a)  If there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, then upon receipt by the Pledgor from the Pledgee of a written request or requests that the Pledgor cause any registration, qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock, the Pledgor as soon as practicable and at its expense will cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will cause such qualification and compliance to be declared effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested if such registration, qualification or compliance is necessary to permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such Collateral, including, without limitation, registration under the Securities Act, as then in effect (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with any other government requirements, provided, that the Pledgee shall furnish to the Pledgor such information regarding the Pledgee as the Pledgor may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. The Pledgor will cause the Pledgee to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Pledgee such number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Pledgee from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify the Pledgee and all others participating in the distribution of such Collateral against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact  
  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Pledgor by the Pledgee expressly for use therein.        (b)  If at any time when the Pledgee shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 7 hereof, and the Collateral or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Pledgee may sell such Collateral or part thereof, as the case may be, by private sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem necessary or reasonably advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without such registration.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in any event the Pledgee (i) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale, and (iii) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Collateral or part thereof.  In the event of any such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no responsibility or liability, except to the extent incurred by reason of its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, for selling all or any part of the Collateral at a price which the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid.        20.  TERMINATION; RELEASE.    After payment in full of the Secured Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the security interest created hereby shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall survive any such termination), and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of the Pledgor, will execute and deliver to the Pledgor a proper instrument or instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement, and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the Pledgor (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement, together with any monies at the time held by the Pledgee or any of its sub-agents hereunder.          21.

The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or define the meaning hereof.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one instrument.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall prove to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement which shall remain binding on all parties hereto.   The rights, powers, privileges and immunities of the Collateral Agent set forth in the Credit Agreement shall apply to the Collateral Agent as if expressly set forth herein.        24.

(b)  In addition to the actions required to be taken pursuant to Section 3.2(a) hereof, the Pledgor shall from time to time, at the sole expense of the Pledgor, cause appropriate financing statements (on Form UCC-1 or other appropriate form) under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the various relevant States, in form covering all Collateral hereunder (with the form of such financing statements to be satisfactory to the Pledgee), to be filed in the relevant filing offices so that at all times the Pledgee has a security interest in all Collateral which is perfected by the filing of such financing statements (in each case to the maximum extent perfection by filing may be obtained under the laws of any relevant State).           3.3  Subsequently Acquired Collateral.  If the Pledgor shall acquire (by purchase, dividend or similar distribution or otherwise) any additional Collateral at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, such Collateral shall automatically (and without any further action being required to be taken) be subject to the pledge and security interests created pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof and, furthermore, the Pledgor will promptly thereafter take (or cause to be taken) all action with respect to such Collateral in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2 hereof, and will promptly thereafter deliver to the Pledgee (i) a certificate executed by a principal executive officer of the Pledgor describing such Collateral and certifying that the same has been duly pledged in favor of the Pledgee (for the benefit of the Lenders) hereunder and (ii) supplements to Annexes A and B hereto as are reasonably necessary to cause such annexes to be complete and accurate at such time.             3.4  Transfer Taxes.

The Pledgee shall also be entitled to receive directly, and to retain as part of the Collateral:                (i)  all other or additional capital stock or      other property (including, but not limited to, cash      dividends other than as set forth above) paid or distributed      by way of dividend or otherwise in respect of the      Collateral;                (ii) all other or additional capital stock or      other property paid or distributed in respect of the      Collateral by way of split, spin-off, split-up,      reclassification, combination or similar rearrangement;                (iii)all other or additional capital stock or      other property (including, but not limited to, cash) which      may be paid in respect of the Collateral by reason of any      consolidation, merger, exchange, conveyance of assets,      liquidation or similar reorganization; and                (iv) without limiting the generality of the      foregoing, all shares of Newco Stock distributed in respect      of the Collateral.           Nothing contained in this Section 6 shall limit or restrict in any way the Pledgee's right to have pledged to it proceeds of the Collateral in any form in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.  All dividends, distributions or other payments which are received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6 and Section 7 hereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Pledgee, shall be segregated from other property or funds of the Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Pledgee as Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).           7. REMEDIES IN CASE OF DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT. Subject to the Credit Agreement, if there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights, powers and remedies (whether vested in it by this Agreement, any other Financing Document or by law) for the protection and enforcement of its rights in respect of the Collateral, and the Pledgee shall be entitled to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction and also shall be entitled, without limitation, to exercise the following rights:                (i)  to receive all amounts payable in respect of      the Collateral;                (ii) upon receipt of all requisite regulatory      approvals, to transfer all or any part of the Collateral      into the Pledgee's name or the name of its nominee or      nominees;                (iii)upon receipt of all requisite regulatory      approvals, to vote all or any part of the Collateral      (whether or not transferred into the name of the Pledgee)      and give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect      of the Collateral and otherwise act with respect thereto as      though it were the outright owner thereof (the Pledgor      hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Pledgee      the proxy and attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor, with full      power of substitution to do so) and to exercise any and all      of the rights or powers of the Pledgor in its capacity as a      stockholder of the Issuer;                (iv) at any time and from time to time to sell,      assign and deliver, or grant options to purchase, all or any      part of the Collateral, or any interest therein, at any      public or private sale, without demand of performance,      advertisement or notice of intention to sell or of the time      or place of sale or adjournment thereof or to redeem or      otherwise (all of which are hereby waived by the Pledgor to      the extent permitted by applicable Law), for cash, on credit      or for other property, for immediate or future delivery       without any assumption of credit risk, and for such price or      prices and on such terms as the Pledgee in its absolute      discretion may determine, in each case, to the extent      permitted by applicable Law.  The Pledgee shall not be      obligated to make any such sale of Collateral regardless of      whether any notice of sale has theretofore been given.  The      Pledgor hereby waives and releases to the fullest extent      permitted by law any right or equity of redemption with      respect to the Collateral, whether before or after sale      hereunder (other than the right to pay the Secured      Obligations in full), and all rights, if any, of marshalling      the Collateral and any other security for the Secured      Obligations or otherwise.  At any such sale, to the extent      permitted by applicable Law, the Pledgee may bid for and      purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold free from      any such right or equity of redemption.  The Pledgee shall      not be liable for failure to collect or realize upon any or      all of the Collateral or for any delay in so doing nor shall      any of them be under any obligation to take any action      whatsoever with regard thereto; and                (v)  to set-off any and all Collateral against any      and all Secured Obligations and to apply such Collateral to      the payment of any and all Secured Obligations.           If, pursuant to applicable Law, prior notice of any of the foregoing actions is required to be given to the Pledgee, the Pledgee hereby acknowledges that the minimum time required by such applicable Law, or if no minimum is specified, ten (10) days, shall be deemed a reasonable notice period.           8. REMEDIES, ETC., CUMULATIVE.  Each and every right, power and remedy of the Pledgee provided for in this Agreement or in any other Financing Document, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Pledgee of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or any other Financing Document or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Pledgee of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Pledgee to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Pledgee to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.           9. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

PURCHASERS OF COLLATERAL.  Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Pledgee hereunder (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise), the receipt given by the Pledgee or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Pledgee or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication or nonapplication thereof.           11.

PLEDGOR'S OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE, ETC.  The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, suspended, discharged, terminated or otherwise affected by, any circumstance or occurrence whatsoever (except as provided under Section 20), including, without limitation:  (i) any renewal, extension, amendment or modification of or addition or supplement to or deletion from any Financing Document or any other instrument or agreement referred to therein, or any assignment or transfer of any thereof; (ii) any waiver, consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect of any such agreement or instrument including, without limitation, this Agreement; (iii) any furnishing of any additional security to the Pledgee or its assignee or any acceptance thereof or any release of any security by the Pledgee or its assignee (except as provided under Section 20); (iv) any limitation on any party's liability or obligations under any such instrument or agreement or any invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any such instrument or agreement or any term thereof; or (v) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to the Pledgor or the Issuer, or any action taken with respect to this Agreement by any trustee or receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding, whether or not the Pledgor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing.           19.  REGISTRATION, ETC.  (a)  If there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, then upon receipt by the Pledgor from the Pledgee of a written request or requests that the Pledgor cause any registration, qualification or compliance under any Federal or state securities law or laws to be effected with respect to all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock, the Pledgor as soon as practicable and at its expense will cause such registration to be effected (and be kept effective) and will cause such qualification and compliance to be declared effected (and be kept effective) as may be so requested if such registration, qualification or compliance is necessary to permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of such Collateral, including, without limitation, registration under the Securities Act, as then in effect (or any similar statute then in effect), appropriate qualifications under applicable blue sky or other state securities laws and appropriate compliance with any other government requirements, provided, that the Pledgee shall furnish to the Pledgor such information regarding the Pledgee as the Pledgor may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance. The Pledgor will cause the Pledgee to be kept advised in writing as to the progress of each such registration, qualification or compliance and as to the completion thereof, will furnish to the Pledgee such number of prospectuses, offering circulars or other documents incident thereto as the Pledgee from time to time may reasonably request, and will indemnify the Pledgee and all others participating in the distribution of such Collateral against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) or by any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein (or in any related registration statement, notification or the like) a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by an untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Pledgor by the Pledgee expressly for use therein.           (b)  If at any time when the Pledgee shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or any part of the Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock pursuant to Section 7 hereof, and the Collateral or the part thereof to be sold shall not, for any reason whatsoever, be effectively registered under the Securities Act, as then in effect, the Pledgee may sell such Collateral or part thereof, as the case may be, by private sale in such manner and under such circumstances as the Pledgee may deem necessary or reasonably advisable in order that such sale may legally be effected without such registration.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in any event the Pledgee (i) may proceed to make such private sale notwithstanding that a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under such Securities Act, (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single possible purchaser to effect such sale, and (iii) may restrict such sale to a purchaser who will represent and agree that such purchaser is purchasing for its own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of such Collateral or part thereof.  In the event of any such sale, the Pledgee shall incur no responsibility or liability, except to the extent incurred by reason of its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, for selling all or any part of the Collateral at a price which the Pledgee, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid.           20.  TERMINATION; RELEASE.    After payment in full of the Secured Obligations and termination of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement and the security interest created hereby shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Section 11 hereof shall survive any such termination), and the Pledgee, at the request and expense of the Pledgor, will execute and deliver to the Pledgor a proper instrument or instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and termination of this Agreement, and will duly assign, transfer and deliver to the Pledgor (without recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise applied or released pursuant to this Agreement, together with any monies at the time held by the Pledgee or any of its sub-agents hereunder.             21.

(d)  Concurrently herewith, the parties hereto are entering into the Utility Stock Pledge Agreement (35%)-Continued Tranche B Loan and the Utility Stock Pledge Agreement (35%)-New Tranche B Loan, in each case covering collateral that is separate and distinct from the Collateral.
