Item 5. Other Events
A.  Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2002 Attrition Revenue Adjustment
          On December 3, 2002, an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a draft decision proposing to deny Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) request for a 2002 attrition revenue adjustment   The Utility has requested an annual increase of $76.7 million to its electric distribution revenue requirement and an annual increase of $19.5 million to its gas distribution revenue requirement to allow for recovery of its capital investments and escalating costs of providing electric and gas distribution services in 2002. 
          The ALJs draft decision states that the Utilitys recorded numbers are too stale and the escalation rates too uncertain to sustain a finding increasing rates and that any increase in rates would require a general rate case.
          Comments on the draft decision are due December 23, 2002.  When the CPUC acts on the draft decision, it may adopt all or part of it as written, amend or modify it, or set it aside and prepare its own decision.  
          Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility can predict the outcome of this matter. 
B.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy - Monthly Operating Report
          On December 2, 2002, the Utility filed its monthly operating report for the month ended October 31, 2002 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
