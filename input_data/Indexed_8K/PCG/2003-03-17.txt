Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2002 Attrition Revenue Adjustment
          On March 13, 2003, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) denied Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) request for a 2002 attrition revenue adjustment.  As previously disclosed, an administrative law judge of the CPUC had issued a draft decision on December 3, 2002 that proposed denying the Utilitys request.  The Utility had requested an annual increase of $76.7 million to its electric distribution revenue requirement and an annual increase of $19.5 million to its gas distribution revenue requirement to allow for recovery of its capital investments and escalating costs of providing electric and gas distribution services in 2002.  The attrition rate adjustment mechanism is designed to avoid a reduction in earnings in years between general rate cases to reflect increases in rate base and expenses.
          The CPUC stated that the Utilitys recorded umbers were out of date, the escalation rates were too uncertain to sustain a finding increasing rates and any increase in rates would require a general rate case. 
          The Utility has thirty days to file an application for rehearing with the CPUC.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
