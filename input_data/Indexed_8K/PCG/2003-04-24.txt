Pacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy
Further Stay of Confirmation Trial
        As previously disclosed, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and certain other parties have been participating in a judicially supervised settlement conference in order to explore the possibility of resolving differences between the Utilitys proposed plan of reorganization and the alternative proposed plan of reorganization presented by the CPUC and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors.  In order to accommodate the settlement conference, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (Bankruptcy Court) issued an order on March 11, 2003 staying all proceedings in the confirmation trial for 60 days.  On April 23, 2003, at the request of the judge who is supervising the settlement conference, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order continuing the stay on all proceedings in the confirmation trial for an additional 30 days.  The Bankruptcy Court did not stay proceedings related to ordinary case motions, claims objections, and certain other matters not related to the confirmation trial. 
        The Bankruptcy Court indicated that it will continue a status conference previously scheduled for May 12, 2003, to June 16, 2003, at which time the Bankruptcy Court will schedule further matters relating to discovery and the resumption of the confirmation trial, if necessary.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
