Item 5. Other Events
     On June 19, 2003, PG&E Corporation and its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) and the staff of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced a proposed settlement agreement regarding the competing plans of reorganization submitted in the Utilitys proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (Bankruptcy Court).  The proposed settlement agreement, which the CPUC staff will recommend to the CPUC and to the Bankruptcy Court, follows judicially supervised settlement discussions before Judge Randall Newsome.  Under the proposed settlement agreement, the parties would agree to jointly support a proposed plan of reorganization (Settlement Plan) that embodies the terms and conditions contained in the settlement agreement.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility would agree that they would no longer propose to disaggregate the historic businesses of the Utility as provided for in PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys proposed plan of reorganization (PG&E Plan).  Instead the Utility would remain a vertically integrated utility subject to the CPUCs jurisdiction.  In the proposed settlement agreement, the CPUC would acknowledge that it is fair and in the public interest to allow the Utility to recover, over a reasonable time, prior uncollected costs and to provide the opportunity for the Utilitys shareholders to earn a reasonable rate of return on the Utilitys business. 
     The settlement agreement is subject to the approval of the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and the CPUC and execution of the settlement agreement on or before December 31, 2003.  The CPUC will conduct a public hearing process before deciding whether or not to approve the settlement agreement.  A copy of the proposed settlement agreement is filed with this report as an exhibit.
     The settlement agreement is expressly conditioned on the preparation and approval by the Bankruptcy Court of the Settlement Plan, the disclosure statement for the Settlement Plan, and the Bankruptcy Courts order confirming the Settlement Plan, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each party.  The proposed settlement agreement provides, among other conditions, that the Settlement Plan would not become effective (Effective Date) until (1) Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) have issued credit ratings for the Utility of not less than BBB- and Baa3, respectively, and (2) the CPUC has given final, nonappealable approval for all rates, tariffs, and agreements necessary to implement the Settlement Plan, although PG&E Corporation and the Utility would have the right to waive the finality provision. 
Among other terms, the settlement agreement provides that:
     
 
Regulatory Asset
The CPUC would establish an after-tax regulatory asset of $2.21 billion (Regulatory Asset) as a new, separate and additional part of the Utilitys rate base. The Regulatory Asset would be amortized on a mortgage-style basis over nine years beginning January 1, 2004.  The details and mechanics of the amortization are set forth on Appendix A to the settlement agreement.
The net after-tax amount of any refunds, claim offsets or other credits from generators or other energy suppliers relating to the Utilitys power procurement costs that the Utility actually realizes in cash or by offset of creditor claims in its bankruptcy case would be applied to reduce the outstanding balance and the remaining amortization of the Regulatory Asset.  Amounts received in cash by the Utility from the master settlement agreement resolving an  El Paso Natural Gas Company matter pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and related civil litigation may also effect such a reduction, if consistent with CPUC rules or orders. 
The Regulatory Asset would earn a return on equity (ROE) of at least 11.22 percent for the life of the Regulatory Asset and after the equity component of the Utilitys capital structure reaches 52 percent, the authorized equity component of the Regulatory Asset would be no less than 52 percent for the life of the Regulatory Asset. 
Balances in the Utilitys Transition Cost Balancing Account (which tracks the amount of the Utilitys undercollected transition and electricity procurement costs) as of the Effective Date would have no further impact on the Utilitys retail electric rates and would not be subject to further CPUC review except for verification of recorded balances.
The Utilitys rate base for its retained generation (URG) already established by the CPUC would be deemed just and reasonable and would not be subject to modification, adjustment or reduction, except as necessary to reflect capital expenditures and any change in authorized depreciation; provided that the CPUC would not be precluded from determining the reasonableness of any capital expenditures made on URG after the Effective Date.  The CPUC would commit that it would not reduce or impair the value of the Regulatory Asset or the URG rate base by taking the Regulatory Asset or the URG rate base, their amortization or earnings into account when setting other Utility revenue requirements and resulting rates.  The CPUC would not take the settlement agreement or the Regulatory Asset into account in establishing the Utilitys authorized ROE or capital structure. 
The CPUC would timely act upon the Utilitys applications to collect in rates prudently incurred costs (including return of and return on) of any new, reasonable investment in utility plant and assets. The CPUC would promptly adjust the Utilitys rates consistent with Assembly Bill 57 and Senate Bill 1976 and the CPUC-California Department of Water Resources (DWR) Rate Agreement to ensure that the Utility collection of the following is not impaired:  (1) Fixed Transition Amounts to service existing Rate Reduction Bonds; (2) Regulatory Asset amortization and return; and (3) base revenue requirements ( electric and gas distribution, URG, gas commodity procurement, existing QF contract costs and associated return).  The CPUC would not discriminate against the Utility by reason of the Utilitys bankruptcy, the Utilitys pending federal lawsuit against the CPUC Commissioners to recover its previously incurred costs of providing electric service from ratepayers under the federal filed rate doctrine (the Filed Rate Case), the settlement agreement, the Regulatory Asset, or any other matters addressed or resolved by the proposed settlement agreement.
e.g.,
Ratemaking Matters
The CPUC would maintain the Utilitys retail electric rates at current levels through December 31, 2003.  As of January 1, 2004, the CPUC may adjust the Utilitys retail electric rates prospectively consistent with the settlement agreement, Settlement Plan, the confirmation order and California law.  The proposed settlement agreement contemplates that retail electric rates will be reduced in January 2004, with future reductions thereafter. 
The CPUC would set the Utilitys capital structure and authorized ROE in the Utilitys annual cost of capital proceedings in its usual manner; provided that, from January 1, 2004 until either S&P confers on the Utility a company credit rating of at least A- or Moodys confers on the Utility a company credit rating of at least A3, the authorized ROE would be no less than 11.22 percent per year and the authorized equity ratio for ratemaking purposes would be no less than 52 percent, except that for 2004 and 2005, the authorized equity ratio would equal the greater of the forecast average equity ratio in the cost of capital proceeding and 48.6 percent. 
   As soon as practicable after the CPUC decision approving the settlement agreement, the Utility would be required to file an advice letter to implement all the rate and tariff changes necessary to implement the Settlement Plan. The CPUC would act promptly on the advice filing and revised rates and tariffs and to review and issue a decision promptly on the merits of any application for rehearing of the approval of the advice filing.  The CPUC also would act promptly on certain of the Utilitys pending ratemaking proceedings, including the Utilitys pending 2003 General Rate Case.
Implementation of Ratemaking.
   There would be no restrictions on the ability of the Boards of Directors of the Utility or PG&E Corporation to declare and pay dividends or repurchase common stock, other than the capital structure and stand-alone dividend conditions contained in prior CPUC decisions authorizing the formation of the holding company.  Further, the Utility would agree that it would not pay any dividend on its common stock before July 1, 2004.
Dividend Payments and Stock Repurchases.
  The CPUC could require the Utility to accept assignment of or assume legal and financial responsibility for the DWR contracts only if the following conditions were met:  (1) the company credit rating for the Utility following such assumption  would be no less than A from S&P and A2 from Moodys, (2) the CPUC first made a finding that the contracts are just and reasonable, and (3) the CPUC had acted to ensure full and timely recovery in retail electric rates of all contract costs without further review.  The CPUC would retain the right to review administration and dispatch of the DWR contracts consistent with applicable law.
DWR Contracts.
   The CPUC would agree that the headroom, surcharge and base revenues accrued or collected by the Utility through and including December 31, 2003 are property of the Utilitys Chapter 11 estate, have been or will be used for utility purposes, including to pay claims in the Chapter 11 case, have been included in the Utilitys retail electric rates consistent with state and federal law, and are not subject to refund. For this purpose, headroom means the Utilitys total net after-tax income reported under GAAP, less earnings from operations, plus after-tax amounts accrued for bankruptcy-related administration and bankruptcy-related interest costs, all multiplied by 1.67, provided that the calculation will reflect the outcome of the Utilitys 2003 General Rate Case.  The settlement agreement provides that if headroom revenues accrued by the Utility during 2003 are greater than $875 million, the Utility will refund the excess to ratepayers and if headroom revenues are less than $775 million, the CPUC would allow the Utility to collect the shortfall.
Headroom Revenues.
 .  
Dismissal of Filed Rate Case, Other Litigation and Proceedings
On or as soon as practicable after the later of the Effective Date or the date the CPUC decision approving the settlement agreement is final and nonappealable, the Utility would dismiss with prejudice the Filed Rate Case and withdraw the PG&E Plan.  In exchange, on or before January 1, 2004, the CPUC would establish and authorize the collection of the Regulatory Asset and the URG rate base, and, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, resolve the pending Annual Transition Cost Proceeding in which the CPUC is reviewing the reasonableness of the Utilitys procurement costs incurred during the energy crisis with no adverse impact on the Utilitys cost recovery as filed.  
On or as soon as practicable after the later of the Effective Date or the date the CPUC decision approving the settlement agreement is final and nonappealable, the Utility, PG&E Corporation, on the one hand, and the CPUC, on the other, will execute full mutual releases and dismissals with prejudice of certain claims, actions or regulatory proceedings, as specified in the settlement agreement, arising out of or related in any way to the energy crisis or the implementation of AB 1890, including the CPUCs investigation into past holding company actions during the energy crisis (but only as to past actions, not prospective matters).
   The Utility and PG&E Corporation would agree that upon execution of the settlement agreement, they will request a stay of all proceedings before the FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other regulatory agencies relating to approvals sought to implement the PG&E Plan.  On the Effective Date or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Utility and PG&E Corporation would withdraw or abandon all applications for such regulatory approvals.
Withdrawal of Applications in Connection with PG&E Plan.
  The treatment of creditors under the proposed Settlement Plan would be consistent with that provided in the PG&E Plan, except that those creditors that were to receive long-term notes to be issued by the limited liability companies contemplated under the PG&E Plan or a combination of cash and such long-term notes would be paid entirely in cash.  It is anticipated that all of the Utilitys existing trade and financial debt, except for certain pollution control bond-related obligations, would be paid in cash under the Settlement Plan.  It is further anticipated that these certain obligations and the Utilitys preferred stock would be reinstated under the Settlement Plan. The Settlement Plan would provide for necessary financing including interest rate hedging and would specify creditor treatment. It is anticipated that the Utility would issue approximately $8 billion in debt securities under the Settlement Plan.
Treatment of Creditors.
.   The Utility would implement three environmental enhancement measures: 
Environmental Measures
the Utility would encumber with conservation easements or donate approximately 140,000 acres of land to public agencies or non-profit conservation organizations,
environmental enhancements associated with these lands funded over 10 years with $70 million of ratepayer funding,
the creation of a non-profit corporation funded by shareholders with $15 million over five years dedicated to support research and investment in clean energy technology, primarily in the Utilitys service territory.
  In connection with any action or proceeding concerning the enforcement of the settlement agreement, the Settlement Plan or the confirmation order or other determination of the parties rights under the settlement agreement, the Settlement Plan or the confirmation order, the CPUC would agree to waive all existing and future rights of sovereign immunity, and all other similar immunities, as a defense. The CPUC would agree to consent to the jurisdiction of any court or other tribunal or forum for such actions or proceedings including, but not limited to, the Bankruptcy Court.
Waiver of Sovereign Immunity.
The settlement agreement would generally terminate nine years after the Effective Date. The parties would agree that the Bankruptcy Court will have jurisdiction over the parties for all purposes relating to enforcement of the settlement agreement, the Settlement Plan, and the confirmation order.  The parties also would agree that the settlement agreement, the Settlement Plan or any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court contemplated or required to implement the settlement agreement or the Settlement Plan would be enforceable under federal law, notwithstanding any contrary state law or future decisions or orders of the CPUC.
Term and Enforceability.
Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information, and Exhibits
Exhibit 99  Proposed Settlement Agreement among PG&E Corporation, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the California Public Utilities Commission
Although PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether or when the settlement agreement and Settlement Plan will become effective, it is anticipated that both the CPUC and the Bankruptcy Court approvals to implement the settlement could occur by the end of the year, enabling the financing and repayment of the creditors to occur in the first quarter of 2004.  This statement and other statements in this report about the anticipated implementation of the settlement agreement and the Settlement Plan are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the outcomes contemplated in the forward-looking statements.  Whether or when the settlement agreement and the Settlement Plan become effective and to what extent PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Settlement Plan are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including:
The outcome and the timing of the CPUCs proceeding to approve the settlement agreement and the resulting retail electric rates,
The outcome and the timing of the Bankruptcy Courts proceeding to confirm the Settlement Plan,
Whether the required credit ratings to implement the Settlement Plan are obtained,
The outcome of any litigation that may arise to challenge the settlement agreement or the Settlement Plan, including the prosecution of any appeals related to the CPUC order approving the settlement agreement or the Bankruptcy Courts confirmation order and the affect any pending appeals may have on the ability of the Utility to complete the financing contemplated under the Settlement Plan,
The outcome of the case pending before the California Supreme Court to consider the CPUCs authority to enter into a settlement agreement with Southern California Edison,
The impact of future ratemaking actions of the CPUC,
Changes that may be made to California's electric industry restructuring legislation and to other applicable regulations, including for example, legislation that would repeal major portions of the electric industry restructuring law or that would extend the CPUC's jurisdiction to regulate certain activities of the parent companies of the California investor-owned electric and gas utilities,
Future equity or debt market conditions, future interest rates, future credit ratings, and other factors that may affect the ability to implement the Settlement Plan or affect the terms, amount, and value of the debt securities proposed to be issued under the Settlement Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrants have duly caused this report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Dated:  June 19, 2003

                                                                       
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
This Settlement Agreement (Agreement) is made and entered into by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), PG&E Corporation (the Parent or PG&E Corporation) (PG&E and PG&E Corporation are collectively referred to as the PG&E Proponents), and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, as of ___________, 2003 (each of which is individually referred to as a Party, and collectively as the Parties)
A.        On April 6, 2001, PG&E filed a voluntary case under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, Case No. 01-30923 DM (the Chapter 11 Case), pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (the Court).
B.         The PG&E Proponents filed a Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, dated April 19, 2002, as Modified by Modifications Dated July 9, 2002, October 18, 2002, December 13, 2002, December 26, 2002, February 21, 2003, February 24, 2003, and May 22, 2003 (the PG&E Plan).
C.        On April 15, 2002, the Commission filed its original plan of reorganization for PG&E.  Subsequently, the Commission and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the OCC) appointed in the Chapter 11 Case filed a Second Amended Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code for Pacific Gas and Electric Company, dated November 6, 2002.  Then, on December 5, 2002, the Commission and the OCC filed their Third Amended Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the Commission Plan).
D.        The Court began trial on the competing plans of reorganization on November 18, 2002.  During the trial on the PG&E Plan, the Court entered an order staying further confirmation and related proceedings for 60 days to facilitate a mandatory settlement process before the Honorable Randall J. Newsome, Bankruptcy Judge.  On April 23, 2003, at the request of Judge Newsome, the Court issued an order staying further confirmation and related proceedings for an additional 30 days.  On June 9, 2003, the Court issued an order staying further confirmation and related proceedings for an additional four days, with a status conference scheduled for June 20, 2003.
E.         Neither PG&E nor PG&E Corporation has declared or paid any dividends to holders of their common stock since October 2000, and are agreeing in this Agreement not to do so before July 1, 2004.  As a result, PG&Es and PG&E Corporations shareholders have foregone and will forego dividends of approximately $1.7 billion.
F.         The Parties desire to settle their differences with respect to the competing plans of reorganization and the other matters specified herein, and to jointly support a plan of reorganization for PG&E (the Settlement Plan), all as set forth more specifically below. 
G.        In the exercise of its police and regulatory powers, the Commission is entering into this Agreement and shall adopt such decisions and orders as necessary to implement and carry out the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to, establishing Retail Electric Rates to provide for payment in full of the Securities and the Regulatory Asset (each as defined below) in accordance with their respective terms.
(1)        The Parties recognize that reliable electric and gas service is of the utmost importance to the safety, health, and welfare of Californias citizenry and economy. 
(2)        The Parties expect that under the Settlement Plan, Retail Electric Rates (as defined below) will be reduced on January 1, 2004, with further reductions expected thereafter.
(3)        As part of this Agreement, the PG&E Proponents will withdraw the PG&E Plan and no longer propose to disaggregate the historic businesses of PG&E.  Instead, PG&E will remain a vertically-integrated utility subject to the Commissions jurisdiction to regulate in the public interest.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Settlement Plan, and the Confirmation Order (as defined below), PG&E shall continue to be regulated by the Commission in accordance with the Commissions policies and practices and the laws and regulations applicable to similarly situated investor-owned utilities in the State of California.
(4)        The Parties enter into this settlement to enable PG&E to emerge from Chapter 11 and fully resume its traditional role of providing safe and reliable electric and gas service at just and reasonable rates, subject to Commission regulation.
(5)        It is in the public interest to restore PG&E to financial health and to maintain and improve PG&Es financial health in the future to ensure that PG&E is able to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service to its customers at just and reasonable rates.  The Parties intend that PG&E emerge from Chapter 11 as soon as possible with a company credit rating of Investment Grade and that PG&Es company credit rating will improve over time.  Investment Grade credit ratings are necessary for PG&E to emerge from Chapter 11 and will directly benefit PG&Es ratepayers by reducing the cost of the financings (i) required for emergence and (ii) required to fund future operations and capital expenditures.  In order to help accomplish these goals, it is fair and in the public interest to allow PG&E to recover, over a reasonable time, prior uncollected costs and to provide the opportunity for PG&Es shareholders to earn a reasonable rate of return on PG&Es utility business, all as described herein.
(6)        Among other things, as part of this Agreement, PG&E will release claims against the Commission that would have been retained by PG&E or its Parent under the PG&E Plan.  In lieu of those claims and the value that PG&Es shareholders would have received from the transactions provided for under the PG&E Plan, PG&Es shareholders will receive value over nine years through this Agreement, the Settlement Plan and the Confirmation Order (as defined below), including amortization of the Regulatory Asset as provided for herein.
(7)        The Commission acknowledges and agrees that the benefit of this Agreement to PG&Es shareholders requires that the Commission provide timely and full recovery of PG&Es reasonable costs of providing utility service, including return of and return on investment in utility plant and recovery of operating expenses, including power procurement costs, over the full nine-year amortization period of the Regulatory Asset.  The Commission intends to provide PG&E with the opportunity to recover all of its prudently incurred costs as well as a return of and return on its investment in utility plant.  The Commission also intends that any operational mandate it imposes that requires PG&E to expend funds or incur costs, including demand reduction or energy conservation programs, include a timely rate recovery mechanism for the costs of such mandate. 
In consideration of the respective covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement the Parties agree as follows:

The Regulatory Asset shall earn PG&Es authorized return on equity (ROE) on the equity component of PG&Es capital structure as set in PG&Es annual cost of capital proceedings, the ROE on the Regulatory Asset shall be no less than 11.22 percent per year for the life of the Regulatory Asset and that, once the equity component of PG&Es capital structure reaches 52 percent, the authorized equity component for the Regulatory Asset shall be no less than 52 percent for the life of the Regulatory Asset. 
provided that
c.         The Commission will use its usual methodology for tax-effecting the ROE component for purposes of setting PG&Es revenue requirements associated with the unamortized portion of the Regulatory Asset.  The Commission will apply the same method of tax-effecting to the scheduled amortization of the Regulatory Asset.  The Commission shall authorize PG&E to establish a Tax Tracking Account to be used as follows:  In the event that it is finally determined that PG&E is required to pay income taxes on the Regulatory Asset any earlier than the Regulatory Asset is amortized pursuant to Paragraph 2a, PG&E shall record in the Tax Tracking Account the difference between (1) the taxes incurred on account of the Regulatory Asset plus any interest imposed by the federal or state taxing authorities with respect to such earlier recognition of taxable income and (2) the taxes that would have been incurred on account of the Regulatory Asset had it been subject to tax as it was amortized pursuant to Paragraph 2a.  The Tax Tracking Account shall earn PG&Es authorized rate of return in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 2b.  PG&E shall amortize the Tax Tracking Account in Retail Electric rates over the greater of the remaining life of the Regulatory Asset or five years.
d.         PG&E shall continue to cooperate with the Commission and the State in seeking refunds from generators and other energy suppliers.  The net after-tax amount of any refunds, claim offsets or other credits from generators or other energy suppliers relating to PG&Es PX, ISO, QF or ESP costs that PG&E actually realizes in Cash or by offset of creditor claims in the Chapter 11 Case shall be applied by PG&E to reduce the outstanding balance of the Regulatory Asset dollar for dollar.  To the extent that any consideration actually received by PG&E in Cash under the Master Settlement Agreement that resolves the litigation in FERC Docket No. RP00-241-000, , and related litigation in state and federal courts, is in settlement of damages claimed by PG&E that caused PG&E to incur high costs of electricity from March 1, 2000 to date, PG&E shall apply the net after-tax amount of such consideration to reduce the outstanding balance of the Regulatory Asset dollar for dollar, provided that such a reduction is consistent with the rules or orders adopted by the Commission concerning the consideration paid by El Paso under the Master Settlement Agreement.  These reductions shall reduce the remaining amortization of the Regulatory Asset, as set forth in Appendix A, Technical Appendix.
Public Utilities Commission of California v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., et al.,
et al.
e.         Balances in PG&Es TCBA, determined in accordance with Commission Decision No. 01-03-082,  as of January 1, 2004 shall have no further impact on PG&Es Retail Electric Rates and shall be subject to no further review by the Commission except for verification of recorded balances, and PG&Es current Retail Electric Rates will be replaced by the Retail Electric Rates resulting from this Agreement, the Settlement Plan and the Confirmation Order as of January 1, 2004.  This is not intended to affect PG&Es pending application (Application No. 00-07-013) to recover electric restructuring costs booked into the Electric Restructuring Cost Account pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 376 or to otherwise affect recovery of QF and other nonbypassable costs going forward.
f.          The Commission agrees that PG&E should receive the benefit of this Agreement over the entire life of the Regulatory Asset.  To ensure this, the Commission agrees that the URG Rate Base for PG&E already established by the Commission in D.02-04-016 shall be deemed just and reasonable and not subject to modification, adjustment or reduction, except as necessary to reflect capital expenditures and any change in authorized depreciation.  (This shall not preclude the Commission from determining the reasonableness of any capital expenditures made on URG after the Effective Date.)  The Commission further agrees that it shall not in any way reduce or impair the value of the Regulatory Asset or the URG Rate Base by taking the Regulatory Asset or the URG Rate Base, their amortization or earnings into account when setting other revenue requirements and resulting rates for PG&E.  Nor shall the Commission take this Agreement or the Regulatory Asset into account in establishing PG&Es authorized ROE or capital structure. 
g.         The Commission recognizes that the establishment, maintenance and improvement of Investment Grade company credit ratings is vital for PG&E to be able to continue to provide safe and reliable service to its customers.  The Commission further recognizes that the establishment, maintenance and improvement of PG&Es Investment Grade company credit ratings directly benefits PG&Es ratepayers by reducing PG&Es immediate and future borrowing costs, which, in turn, will allow PG&E to finance its operations and make capital expenditures on its distribution, transmission, and generation assets at lower cost to its ratepayers.  In furtherance of these objectives, the Commission agrees to act to facilitate and maintain Investment Grade company credit ratings for PG&E.
h.         As part of ensuring that PG&E has the opportunity to recover all its prudently incurred costs of providing service, including return of and return on utility investment, the Commission agrees that it shall timely act upon PG&Es applications to collect in rates its prudently incurred costs (including return of and return on) of any new, reasonable investment in utility plant and assets.
i.          The Commission shall promptly adjust PG&Es rates consistent with AB 57/SB 1976 and the Commission-DWR Rate Agreement to ensure that PG&Es collection of the following is not impaired:  (1) Fixed Transition Amount to service existing Rate Reduction Bonds; (2) Regulatory Asset amortization and return; and (3) base revenue requirements ( electric and gas distribution, URG, gas commodity procurement, existing QF contract costs and associated return). 
e.g.,
j.          The Commission agrees that, in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, PG&Es expected regulatory outcomes and financial performance should be similar to those of the other investor-owned energy utilities in California under similar circumstances.  In furtherance of the foregoing, the Commission shall not discriminate against PG&E by reason of the Chapter 11 Case, the Rate Recovery Litigation, this Agreement, the Regulatory Asset or any other matters addressed or resolved herein.
3.         . 
Ratemaking Matters
a.         The Commission agrees to maintain PG&Es Retail Electric Rates at current levels through December 31, 2003.  As of January 1, 2004, the Commission may adjust PG&Es Retail Electric Rates prospectively consistent with this Agreement, the Settlement Plan, the Confirmation Order and California law.
b.         The Commission shall set PG&Es capital structure and authorized ROE in PG&Es annual cost of capital proceedings in its usual manner; , from January 1, 2004 until either S&P confers on PG&E a company credit rating of at least A- or Moodys confers on PG&E a company credit rating of at least A3, the authorized ROE shall be no less than 11.22 percent per year and the authorized equity ratio for ratemaking purposes shall be no less than 52 percent, except for a transition period as provided below.  The Commission recognizes that, at the Effective Date, PG&Es capital structure will likely not contain 52 percent equity.  Accordingly, for 2004 and 2005, the authorized equity ratio shall equal the Forecast Average Equity Ratio, but in no event shall it be less than 48.6 percent.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 6, PG&E agrees not to pay any dividend on common stock before July 1, 2004. 
provided that
c.         Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a rate freeze or rate cap for PG&Es electric or gas business.
  To ensure that all conditions to the Effective Date are met as soon as possible following issuance of the Confirmation Order, as soon as practicable after the Commission decision approving this Agreement, PG&E shall file an advice letter to implement all the rate and tariff changes necessary to implement the Settlement Plan.  The Commission shall act promptly on the advice filing and revised rates and tariffs.  The Commission shall also review and issue a decision promptly on the merits of any application for rehearing of the approval of the advice filing. 
4.         .
Implementation of Ratemaking
  The Commission and PG&E agree that timely applications by PG&E and timely action by the Commission on such applications are essential to the achievement of the objectives of this settlement.  The Commission agrees that it will promptly act on the pending PG&E ratemaking proceedings listed in Appendix B hereto.
5.         .
Timely Decisions on Ratemaking Matters
           The Parties acknowledge that, for the Parent, as PG&Es shareholder, to receive the benefit of this Agreement, both PG&E and its Parent must be able to pay dividends and repurchase common stock when appropriate.  Accordingly, the Parties agree that, other than the capital structure and stand-alone dividend conditions contained in the PG&E holding company decisions (D.96-11-017 and D.99-04-068), the Commission shall not restrict the ability of the boards of directors of either PG&E or PG&E Corporation to declare and pay dividends or repurchase common stock.
6.
.
Dividend Payments and Stock Repurchases
         If the Commission desires it, PG&E agrees to accept an assignment of or to assume legal and financial responsibility for the DWR Contracts, (a) PG&Es company credit rating, after giving effect to such assignment or assumption, shall be no less than A from S&P and A2 from Moodys; (b) the Commission shall first have made a finding that, for purposes of assignment or assumption, the DWR Contracts to be assigned or assumed are just and reasonable; and (c) the Commission shall have acted to ensure that PG&E will receive full and timely recovery in its Retail Electric Rates of all costs of such DWR Contracts over their life without further review.  The Commission agrees not to require PG&E to assume or accept an assignment of legal or financial responsibility for the DWR Contracts unless conditions (a), (b) and (c) are all met.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Commission to review the prudence of PG&Es administration and dispatch of the DWR Contracts, consistent with applicable law.

Headroom Revenues
a.         The Commission acknowledges and agrees that the Headroom, surcharge, and base revenues accrued or collected by PG&E through and including December 31, 2003 are property of PG&Es Chapter 11 estate, have been or will be used for utility purposes, including to pay creditors in the Chapter 11 Case, have been included in PG&Es Retail Electric Rates consistent with state and federal law, and are not subject to refund.
b.         The Headroom revenues accrued by PG&E during calendar year 2003 shall not exceed $875 million and shall not be less than $775 million, both on a pre-tax basis.  If the amount of Headroom PG&E accrues in 2003 is greater or less than these amounts, the Commission shall take such action in 2004 as is necessary to require PG&E to refund any Headroom accrued in excess of $875 million or, if the accrued Headroom is less than $775 million, to allow PG&E to collect in rates the difference between the Headroom accrued and $775 million.
           On or as soon as practicable after the later of the Effective Date or the date on which the Commission approval of this Agreement is no longer subject to appeal, PG&E shall dismiss with prejudice the Rate Recovery Litigation, foregoing any recovery from ratepayers of costs sought in such litigation not otherwise provided for in this Agreement and the Settlement Plan; withdraw the PG&E Plan; dismiss other pending proceedings, as specified herein; and provide the other consideration described herein.  In exchange, on or before January 1, 2004, the Commission shall establish and authorize the collection of the Regulatory Asset and the URG Rate Base, and on or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the Commission shall resolve Phase 2 of the presently pending ATCP Application with no adverse impact on PG&Es cost recovery as filed, and provide the other consideration described herein.  PG&Es motion to dismiss the Rate Recovery Litigation shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Commission.

Dismissal of the Rate Recovery and Other Litigation
         On or as soon as practicable after the later of the Effective Date or the date on which the Commission approval of this Agreement is no longer subject to appeal, PG&E and PG&E Corporation, on the one hand, and the Commission, on the other, will execute full mutual releases and dismissals with prejudice of all claims, actions or regulatory proceedings arising out of or related in any way to the energy crisis or the implementation of A.B. 1890 listed on Appendix C hereto.  All such releases and dismissals with prejudice shall be in form and substance satisfactory to PG&E, PG&E Corporation and the Commission.

Withdrawal of Certain Applications
a.         Promptly upon the Effective Date, PG&E shall withdraw all of its applications previously filed with the FERC, the NRC, the SEC and elsewhere in connection with the PG&E Plan.  A full and complete list of such applications is set forth in Appendix D hereto.  Upon execution of this Agreement, PG&E and PG&E Corporation shall move to obtain or otherwise request a stay of all actions before the FERC, NRC, SEC or a similar agency initiated by PG&E and/or PG&E Corporation to implement the PG&E Plan.  In addition, upon execution of this Agreement by all Parties, PG&E and PG&E Corporation shall suspend all actions to obtain or transfer licenses, permits and franchises to implement the PG&E Plan.  On the Effective Date or as soon thereafter as practicable, PG&E and PG&E Corporation shall withdraw or abandon all such applications for licenses, permits and franchises.
b.         In addition to withdrawing its pending applications at FERC, PG&E and PG&E Corporation agree that, for the life of the Regulatory Asset, neither they nor any of their affiliates or subsidiaries will make any filing under Sections 4, 5 or 7 of the Natural Gas Act to transfer ownership of or ratemaking jurisdiction over PG&Es intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage facilities, and to keep such natural gas pipeline and storage facilities subject to the regulation of the Commission.  In addition, PG&E and PG&E Corporation agree that the Commission has jurisdiction under existing Public Utilities Code section 851 to review and approve any proposal by PG&E to dispose of property necessary or useful in the performance of PG&Es duties to the public.
In order to take advantage of the current favorable interest-rate climate, the Commission agrees that the actual reasonable cost of PG&Es interest rate hedging activities with respect to the financing necessary for the Settlement Plan shall be reflected and recoverable in PG&Es retail gas and electric rates without further review.

Financing
a.         It is anticipated that all of PG&Es existing trade and financial debt, except for the MBIA Insured PC Bonds and the Letter of Credit Backed PC Bonds, shall be paid in Cash under the Settlement Plan.  It is further anticipated that the MBIA Insured PC Bonds, the Letter of Credit Backed PC Bonds and the Preferred Stock shall be reinstated under the Settlement Plan.  The Settlement Plan will detail the proposed financing and creditor treatment.
b.         The financing of the Settlement Plan shall not include any new preferred or common stock. 
c.         All financing shall be arranged and placed by a financing team led by PG&E that includes representatives of the Commission and PG&E and shall be duly authorized by the Commission and subject to the authority and duty of the boards of directors of PG&E and PG&E Corporation to approve such financing.  The financing shall be designed and accomplished so as to minimize the cost to ratepayers consistent with achieving an appropriate and financially flexible capital structure.
d.         In consideration for the agreement by UBS Warburg LLC and Lehman Brothers each to (i) limit its consummation and/or advisory fee to $20 million (in the case of Lehman Brothers inclusive of advisory fees already paid by PG&E Corporation and further subject to the crediting provisions contained in Lehman Brothers engagement letter, and, in the case of UBS Warburg LLC, in lieu of the full consummation fee calculated pursuant to section 2(d) of UBS Warburg LLCs engagement letter with the Commission and the OCC), which shall be payable on the Effective Date, and (ii) jointly provide the bank facilities determined by PG&E to be necessary under the Settlement Plan (subject to negotiation of satisfactory terms and conditions), PG&E agrees to name UBS Warburg LLC and Lehman Brothers as exclusive book runners, lead managers and hedging providers of all financings pursuant to the Settlement Plan with equal economics for 80 percent of the aggregate of total fees and commissions payable on such financings, and otherwise on customary terms as agreed among them.  To the extent that PG&E adds co-managers, the Commission shall have the right to appoint one additional co-manager at the highest level of economics available to co-managers.
e.         All documents used or prepared by PG&E in connection with the financing, including prospectuses, indentures and notes, shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Commission.
f.          The cost of the financing, including principal, interest, any fees or discounts payable to investment bankers, capital markets arrangers or book runners, including the fees to be paid to UBS Warburg LLC and Lehman Brothers pursuant to Paragraph 13d, as well as any past or future call premiums on reacquired debt, shall be fully recoverable as part of the cost of debt to be collected in PG&Es retail gas and electric rates without further review. 
The treatment of creditors under the Settlement Plan will be consistent with that provided in the PG&E Plan, except that those creditors that were to receive Long-Term Notes or a combination of Cash and Long-Term Notes will be paid entirely in Cash.

If it is determined by court order that such an application is required for all or any part of such fees and expenses, then the Parties shall support such application in a written pleading to be filed with the Court and such fees and expenses shall be allowed and treated as an Administrative Expense Claim under the Settlement Plan in the amount approved by the Court.  The Commission shall authorize PG&E to recover the amounts so paid or reimbursed to the Commission in retail rates over a reasonable period of time, not to exceed four years.  PG&E shall not recover any portion of the amounts so paid or reimbursed to PG&E Corporation in retail rates; rather, such costs shall be borne solely by shareholders through a reduction in retained earnings.

LAND CONSERVATION COMMITMENT
                                                                  
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
PG&E shall ensure that the Watershed Lands it owns and Carizzo Plains are conserved for a broad range of beneficial public values, including the protection of the natural habitat of fish, wildlife and plants, the preservation of open space, outdoor recreation by the general public, sustainable forestry, agricultural uses, and historic values.  PG&E will protect these beneficial public values associated with the Watershed Lands and Carizzo Plains from uses that would conflict with their conservation.  PG&E recognizes that such lands are important to maintaining the quality of life of local communities and all the people of California in many ways, and it is PG&Es intention to protect and preserve the beneficial public values of these lands under the terms of any agreements concerning their future ownership or management.
PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation will develop a plan for protection of these lands for the benefit of the citizens of California.  Protecting such lands will  be accomplished through either (1) PG&Es donation of conservation easements to one or more public agencies or qualified conservation organizations consistent with these objectives, or (2) PG&Es donation of lands in fee to one or more public entities or qualified conservation organizations, whose ownership would be consistent with these conservation objectives. 
                                                                               
COMMITMENTS
1.         :  The Watershed Lands and Carizzo Plains shall (1) be subject to permanent conservation easements restricting development of the lands so as to protect and preserve their beneficial public values, and/or (2) be donated in fee simple to one or more public entities or qualified non-profit conservation organizations, whose ownership will ensure the protection of these beneficial public values.  PG&E will not be expected to make fee simple donations of Watershed Lands that contain PG&Es hydroelectric project features.  In instances where PG&E has donated land in fee, some may be sold to private entities subject to conservation easements and others, without significant public interest value, may be sold to private entities with few or no restrictions.
PG&E Shall Place Permanent Conservation Easements on or Donate Watershed Lands
The conservation easements shall provide for the preservation of land areas for the protection of the natural habitat of fish, wildlife and plants, the preservation of open space, outdoor recreation by the general public, sustainable forestry, agricultural uses, and historic values and, shall prevent any other uses that will significantly impair or interfere with those values.  Conservation easements on the Watershed Lands will include an express reservation of a right for continued operation and maintenance of hydroelectric facilities and associated water delivery facilities, including project replacements and improvements required to meet existing and future water delivery requirements for power generation and consumptive water use by existing users, compliance with any FERC license, FERC license renewal or other regulatory requirements. In addition, easements will honor existing agreements for economic uses, including consumptive water deliveries.  The conservation easements shall be donated to and managed by one or more non-profit conservation trustees, qualified conservation organizations or public agencies with the experience and expertise to fully and strictly implement the conservation easements.
2.         : PG&E will work with PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation and the Commission in the development and implementation of the conservation easements and land donation plan.  PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation will recommend to PG&E (1) conservation objectives for the properties, including identification of conservation values, (2) criteria for ultimate disposition of the properties, (3) conservation easements guidelines, and (4) land disposition plans.
Process For Development of the Conservation Easements and Land Donation Plan
3.         :  PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation will prepare a report to the Commission within 18 months of the Effective Date describing the status of the conservation easement and land disposition plan.  PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation will make the report available to the public upon request.  Every two years following the first report, PG&E Environmental Enhancement Corporation will prepare a report to the Commission on the implementation of the conservation easement and land disposition plan.
