EPS guidance is based on
forward-looking statements regarding estimated earnings for 2003 and 2004, and the outcome of the Utility's Chapter 11 proceeding. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions which management believes are reasonable, but these statements are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include:
The outcome of the Utility's Chapter 11 proceeding, including whether the proposed settlement agreement becomes effective and whether the Settlement Plan is implemented;
Whether the assumptions contained in Exhibit C to the Disclosure Statement describing the Settlement Plan are realized;
Unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures;
The level and volatility of wholesale electricity and natural gas prices and the Utility's ability to manage and respond to this volatility successfully;
Changes in market demand and general economic and financial market conditions, including unanticipated changes in interest or inflation rates;
The demand for and pricing of natural gas transportation and storage services;
The Utility's ability to manage the net open position over time which can be affected by whether various counterparties are able to meet their obligations under their power sale agreements with the Utility or with the DWR;
Applicable governmental policies and legislative or regulatory actions;
Future regulatory proceedings related to whether the Utility has complied with all applicable rules, tariffs, and orders, and the extent to which a finding of non-compliance could result in customer refunds, penalties, or other non-recoverable expense;
Pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, including the 2003 General Rate Case, and proceedings to determine the allocable amount of DWR revenue requirements and the method of remittance of pass-through revenues collected by the Utility to the DWR, the timing and impact of the end of the retail electricity rate freeze, the structure of post-rate freeze ratemaking and whether the Utility is required to refund previously collected revenues to ratepayers;
Competition and the level of direct access customers;
New accounting pronouncements, including significant changes in accounting policies material to the Utility;
How the CPUC administers the capital structure, stand-alone dividend and first priority conditions of the holding company conditions;
The effect of compliance with existing and future environmental laws, regulations and policies; and
Whether PG&E Corporation is determined to be liable for any claims asserted by NEG or its creditors in NEG's bankruptcy proceeding against PG&E Corporation and the amount of any claims for which PG&E Corporation is determined to be liable.
