Item 5.     Other Events
          On December 22, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (Bankruptcy Court) issued an order confirming Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) plan of reorganization (Settlement Plan) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after a hearing and review of certain modifications to the Settlement Plan made in order to conform to the settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) entered into among the Utility, its parent, PG&E Corporation, and the California Public Utilities Commission.  The Bankruptcy Court also approved the Settlement Agreement and found that the terms of the Settlement Agreement were enforceable by the Bankruptcy Court as material provisions of the Settlement Plan as if they were set forth verbatim in the Settlement Plan.
The Bankruptcy Court scheduled a hearing on January 5, 2004 to consider proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Further, if any appeals of the confirmation order are filed and if a motion to stay the order pending appeal is filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Court will hear arguments on any motions to stay the confirmation order on January 5, 2004.
