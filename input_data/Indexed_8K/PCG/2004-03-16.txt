          At its meeting on March 16, 2004, the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) announced that it had denied the applications for rehearing of the CPUCs December 18, 2003 decision approving the settlement agreement
entered into among Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), PG&E Corporation and the CPUC on December 19, 2003  (Settlement Agreement) to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 proceeding pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.  The Settlement Agreement is incorporated into the Utilitys confirme

plan of reorganization.
          
Separate applications for rehearing had been filed by the City of Palo Alto
, the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), and Aglet Consumer Alliance (Aglet).
 
CCSF, Aglet, and the CPUCs Office of Ratepayer Advocates, or ORA (an independent office within the CPUC) also had filed a joint application for rehearing.  Within thirty days after the CPUC issues its rehearing decision, one or more of the applicants may seek judicial review of the CPUCs denial of their applications by filing a petition with either a California court of appeal or the California Supreme Court.
