Item 5. Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure
     On March 23, 2004, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) closed its public offering of $6.7 billion in first mortgage bonds. The $6.7 billion in first mortgage bonds consisted of $600 million of 3.60% First Mortgage Bonds due 2009, $500 million of 4.20% First Mortgage Bonds due 2011, $1 billion of 4.80% First Mortgage Bonds due 2014, $3 billion of 6.05% First Mortgage Bonds due 2034, and $1.6 billion of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due 2006. Proceeds of the offering, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to implementing the Utility's confirmed plan of reorganization, are expected to be used to pay allowed creditor claims pursuant to the plan.
     In order to furnish certain exhibits for incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement on Form S-3 previously filed by the Utility with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as amended by Amendment No. 1 (File No. 333-109994) (Registration Statement), the Utility is filing the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 18, 2004, between Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Lehman Brothers Inc. and UBS Securities LLC as Exhibit 1.1 to the Registration Statement, the Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of March 11, 2004, between Pacific Gas and Electric Company and BNY Western Trust Company as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement, the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 23, 2004, between Pacific Gas and Electric Company and BNY Western Trust Company as Exhibit 4.2 to the Registration Statement, the Escrow Deposit and Disbursement Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2004, among Pacific Gas and Electric Company and BNY Western Trust Company as escrow agent and trustee as Exhibit 4.3 to the Registration Statement, the Calculation Agency Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2004, between Pacific Gas and Electric Company and BNY Western Trust Company as Exhibit 4.4 to the Registration Statement, and two opinions of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, dated March 23, 2004, as Exhibits 5.1 and 5.2 to the Registration Statement.
     As a result of recent events, including but not limited to recent actions taken by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's with respect to the credit ratings for the Utility and the first mortgage bonds, and the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) denial of applications for rehearing of its December 18, 2003 decision approving the settlement agreement entered into among the Utility, PG&E Corporation and the CPUC to resolve the Utility's Chapter 11 proceeding (Settlement Agreement), and the closing of the Utility's public offering of $6.7 billion in first mortgage bonds, the Utility anticipates that it will meet the accounting criteria necessary to record certain regulatory assets at March 31, 2004. As discussed in Note 2 to the Utility's December 31, 2003 consolidated financial statements, these regulatory assets include the approximate $2.21 billion after-tax regulatory asset ($3.7 billion pre-tax) provided for under the Settlement Agreement and a regulatory asset of approximately $800 million after-tax ($1.3 billion pre-tax) related to the Utility's 2003 generation rate base which the CPUC found to be just and reasonable under the Settlement Agreement.

The Bonds will be issued pursuant to an Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of March 11, 2004, and the First Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of March 23, 2004 (together, the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and BNY Western Trust Company, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"). This agreement (this "AGREEMENT") is to confirm the agreement concerning the purchase of the Bonds from the Company by the Underwriters.
Until the Release Date (as defined in the Indenture), the Bonds will be secured as to payment of principal and interest by a lien on the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the Indenture) to the extent provided in the Indenture. On and after the Release Date, the Bonds will cease to be secured by the lien on the Mortgaged Property and will become unsecured obligations of the Company.

The Escrow Agent will release the escrowed proceeds upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Upon release, all or substantially all the funds deposited in the escrow account will be used to pay allowed claims under the Plan. 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that: (a) The registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-109994) with respect to the Bonds (i) has been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and the rules and regulations (the "RULES AND REGULATIONS") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") thereunder, (ii) has been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act, (iii) either has become effective under the Securities Act and is not proposed to be amended or is proposed to be amended by amendment or post effective amendment and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any Rule 462(b) registration statement has been issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, are contemplated by the Commission.

(q) The Company is not, nor after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Bonds and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus will be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 ACT"). (r) The Company is not subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (the "PUHCA"), as a "holding company," or as a "subsidiary company," "affiliate" or "associate company" of a "registered holding company," within the meaning of PUHCA. The issuance of the Bonds will not violate any provisions of PUHCA or any rule, regulation or order thereunder. (s) The Company has good and valid title to all real property and all personal property owned by it, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims except such as are described in the Prospectus, are permitted by the Indenture or are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made or to 7
be made of such property by the Company or have a material adverse effect on (i) the condition (financial or other), results of operations or business of the Company or (ii) the authority or the ability of the Company to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement or the Bonds; and all real property and buildings held under material leases by the Company are held by them under leases that will be valid, enforceable and in good standing as of the effective date of the Plan, with no exceptions that would materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such property and buildings by the Company. (t) The Company has good and valid title to all real property and all personal property subject to the liens of the Indenture, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims (i) except for such liens, encumbrances, equities or claims as are described in the Prospectus or are permitted by the Indenture and (ii) except for such defects in title as are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such property by the Company, materially impair the liens of the Indenture or have a material adverse effect on (x) the condition (financial or other), results of operations or business of the Company or (y) the authority or the ability of the Company to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement or the Bonds; and all real property and buildings which are leased by the Company and are subject to the liens of the Indenture are held by it under leases that are valid, enforceable and in good standing as of the effective date of the Plan, with no exceptions that would materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such property and buildings by the Company.

(v) When executed and delivered to the Trustee on or prior to the Closing Date, the Indenture will be effective to grant and create, in favor of the Trustee, a valid and enforceable security interest in such of the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the Indenture) in which a security interest can be granted and created under Division 9 of the California Commercial Code and upon the filing of the financing statements filed or to be filed on the Closing Date and identified on Schedule II hereto, such security interest will be perfected under the California Commercial Code in such of the Mortgaged Property described in such financing statements in which a security interest can be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the California Commercial Code. (w) The Company and its subsidiaries carry, or are covered by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is adequate for the conduct of their businesses and the value of their properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries. The Company (i) has not received notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that substantial capital improvements or other material expenditures will have to be made 8
in order to continue such insurance and (ii) has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers at a cost that is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (x) Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, the Company has such permits, licenses, consents, exemptions, franchises, authorizations and other approvals (each, an "AUTHORIZATION") of, and has made all filings with and notices to, all governmental or regulatory authorities (whether domestic or foreign) and self-regulatory organizations and all courts and other tribunals, including without limitation, under any applicable environmental law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or permit, as are necessary to own, lease, license and operate its properties and to conduct its business, except where the failure to have any such Authorization or to make any such filing or notice is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (each such Authorization, a "MATERIAL AUTHORIZATION"). Each Material Authorization is valid and in full force and effect and the Company is in compliance with all the terms and conditions thereof and with the rules and regulations of the authorities and governing bodies having jurisdiction with respect thereto, except where the failure to be valid and in full force and effect or to be in such compliance is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred (including, without limitation, the receipt of any notice from any authority or governing body) which allows or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would allow, revocation, suspension or termination of any such Material Authorization or results or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Material Authorization; and such Authorizations contain no restrictions that are burdensome to the Company, except where such revocation, suspension, termination or other impairment or such restrictions, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. (y) The Company owns or possesses adequate rights to use all material patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights, licenses, inventions, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures) (collectively, the "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") necessary for the conduct of its business and has no reason to believe that the conduct of its business will conflict with, and has not received any notice of any claim of conflict with, any such rights of others with respect to any of such Intellectual Property that, individually or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect. (z) Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, no labor disturbance by the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent, that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. (aa) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA"); no "REPORTABLE EVENT" (as defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any "PENSION PLAN" (as defined in 9
ERISA) for which the Company has any liability; the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to the termination of, or withdrawal from, any "pension plan;" the Company has not incurred, and does not expect to incur, within the next five calendar years, liability under Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (the "CODE"); the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur liability under Section 4971 of the Code; and each "pension plan" for which the Company would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification. (bb) The Company has filed (or has obtained extension for filing) all material federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns required to be filed through the date hereof and has paid all taxes due thereon, other than those (i) currently payable without penalty or interest or (ii) being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which, in the case of both (i) and (ii), adequate reserves have been established on the books and records of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Except as described in the Prospectus, no tax deficiency has been determined adversely to the Company which has had (nor does the Company have any knowledge of any tax deficiency which, if reasonably expected to be determined adversely to the Company, would result in), individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. (cc) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that (i) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer (or persons performing similar functions) by others within these entities, particularly during the periods in which the filings made by the Company with the Commission which it may make under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are being prepared, (ii) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing of the Company's most recent annual or quarterly report filed with the Commission, and (iii) are effective in all material respects to perform the functions for which they were established. (dd) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. (ee) Based on the evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, the Company is not aware of (i) any significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or any material weaknesses in internal controls or (ii) any fraud, whether or 10
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls. (ff) The Company and its subsidiaries are (i) in compliance with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants ("ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS"), (ii) have received and are in compliance with all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses, and (iii) have not received notice of any actual or potential liability for the investigation or remediation of any disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except where such non-compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals, or liability would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus. Except as set forth in the Prospectus, the Company has not been named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, except in such instances which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (gg) In the ordinary course of its business, the Company periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, the Company has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus. (hh) The industry and market-related data and estimates included in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement are based on or derived from sources which the Company believes to be reliable and accurate in all material respects or represent the Company's good faith estimates that are made on the basis of data derived from such sources. (ii) The Settlement Agreement, dated December 19, 2003 (the "SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT"), among the Company, PG&E Corporation and the CPUC, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and PG&E Corporation, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company and PG&E Corporation, as applicable, and is enforceable against the Company and PG&E Corporation, as applicable, in accordance with its terms except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights or remedies generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Settlement Agreement conforms, or will conform, in all material respects to the description thereof in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The CPUC has authorized the Settlement Agreement. The 11
Settlement Agreement has not been modified in any material way since December 19, 2003 and remains in full force and effect. The CPUC has authorized the issuance and sale by the Company of the Bonds, and such authorization is in full force and effect and sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Bonds to the Underwriters. (jj) Except as set forth in the Prospectus, the Company is in compliance with all conditions set forth by the CPUC in any decisions of the CPUC which impose requirements or conditions on the Company, except where the failure to be in compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. (kk) The Plan has been duly authorized by the Company and PG&E Corporation, and the description thereof in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus is accurate in all material respects. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division (the "BANKRUPTCY COURT"), has issued an order confirming the Plan (the "CONFIRMATION ORDER"). Except for the modification set forth in the Order of the Bankruptcy Court dated February 27, 2004 and the Order dated March 15, 2004, Approving Technical Modification to Plan of Reorganization re: the Effective Date and Supplementing Confirmation Order to Include Such Modification (the "FEBRUARY/MARCH BANKRUPTCY ORDERS"), the Plan has not been modified in any material way or withdrawn since the date of its confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. All conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan will have been satisfied or waived on the Closing Date, other than the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 8.2(f) and 8.2(h) of the Plan. 2. Purchase of the Bonds by the Underwriters. Subject to the terms and conditions and upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a price equal to 99.903% of the principal amount of 3.60% Bonds due 2009, 99.740% of the principal amount of 4.20% Bonds due 2011, 99.847% of the principal amount of 4.80% Bonds due 2014, 99.512% of the principal amount of 6.05% Bonds due 2034 and 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Bonds due 2006, in each case plus accrued interest, if any, from March 23, 2004, the principal amount of each series of the Bonds set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto. The Company agrees to pay to the Underwriters an underwriting fee of $43,475,000. The Underwriters propose to offer the Bonds to the public as set forth in the Prospectus. 3. Delivery of and Payment for Bonds. Delivery of the Bonds shall be made at such place or places as mutually may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on March 23, 2004 or on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as shall be determined by you and the Company (the "CLOSING DATE"). Delivery of the Bonds shall be made to you by or on behalf of the Company against payment of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Delivery of the Bonds shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless you shall otherwise instruct. Delivery of the Bonds at the time and place specified in this Agreement is a further condition to the obligations of each Underwriter. 12
4. Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter that: (a) If the Effective Date is on or before the date of this Agreement, the Company shall comply with the provisions of and make all requisite filings with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) not later than the Commission's close of business on the second Business Day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 430A(a)(3) of the Rules and Regulations. The Company shall advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when, if the Effective Date is on or before the date of this Agreement, any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed. The Company shall notify you promptly of any request by the Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon your request, any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in your opinion, may be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Bonds; and the Company shall not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Bonds by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, which filing is not consented to by you after reasonable notice thereof, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the Company may file any such amendment, supplement or document without any such consent if in the judgment of the Company and its counsel such filing is necessary to comply with law and the Company gives notice to the Underwriters of such amendment, supplement or filing promptly in advance of, or contemporaneous with, making the amendment, supplement or filing. The Company shall advise you promptly of the issuance by the Commission or any state or other regulatory body of any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, suspending or preventing the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or suspending the qualification of the Bonds for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution of any proceedings for any such purpose; and the Company shall use every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other such order and, should a stop order or other such order be issued, to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof. (b) The Company shall furnish to each of you and to counsel for the Underwriters copies of the Registration Statement, as originally filed and each amendment thereto (excluding exhibits other than this Agreement), the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to any of such documents (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus), in each case as soon as available, within enough time to allow proper delivery of such documents by the Underwriters, and in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request. (c) Within the time during which the Prospectus relating to the Bonds is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company shall comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the Rules and Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as is necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Bonds as contemplated by the provisions hereof and by the Prospectus. If, during such period, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as 13
then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company shall promptly notify you and shall, subject to Section 4(a) above, amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus or file any document (at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance. (d) Unless publicly available via EDGAR, as soon as practicable, the Company shall make generally available to its security holders (and shall deliver to the Representatives) an earnings statement satisfying the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations. (e) Whether or not this Agreement becomes effective or is terminated or the sale of the Bonds to the Underwriters is consummated, the Company shall, subject to the terms of any applicable Bankruptcy Court order (provided that, under no circumstances, shall the Underwriters be responsible for the fees and expenses set forth in clauses (A) through (H) below), pay or cause to be paid (A) all fees and expenses (including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees and fees and expenses of the Company's accountants) incurred in connection with the preparation, printing, filing, delivery, recording and shipping, as applicable, of the Registration Statement (including the financial statements therein and all amendments and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Indenture, the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed with the Commission (the "Form T-1") and any amendments or supplements of the foregoing and any documents incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing and the copying, delivery and shipping of this Agreement and Blue Sky Memoranda, (B) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and delivery to the Underwriters of the Bonds (including the cost of printing the Bonds), (C) all filing fees and fees and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with the qualification of the Bonds under state securities or Blue Sky laws, (D) any fees required to be paid to rating agencies incurred in connection with the rating of the Bonds, (E) any fees incurred in connection with any review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Bonds, (F) the fees, costs and charges of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee, (G) any fees in connection with filings required in order to perfect the interests of the Trustee in the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the Indenture) and (H) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. If the sale of the Bonds provided for herein is not consummated by reason of acts of the Company or changes in circumstances of the Company pursuant to Section 8 hereof which prevent this Agreement from becoming effective, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Bonds for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 or if the Underwriters terminate this Agreement under clause (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 8(b) of this Agreement), the Company shall, subject to the terms of any applicable Bankruptcy Court order, reimburse the several Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with any investigation or preparation 14
made by them in respect of the marketing of the Bonds or in contemplation of the performance by them of their obligations hereunder. In addition, the Company shall, subject to the terms of any applicable Bankruptcy Court order, pay all fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on and prior to February 2, 2004 and the first $1,000,000 of fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after February 2, 2004. Thereafter, the Company shall pay 50% of all such fees and disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel. (f) Unless publicly available via EDGAR, during the period of one year from the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to the Underwriters copies of all reports or other communications furnished to shareholders as a group and copies of any reports or financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission and the Company shall furnish to the Underwriters copies of all reports and other communications furnished to the Bond holders. (g) Until termination of the offering of the Bonds, the Company shall timely file all documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (h) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds as set forth in the Escrow Agreement and the Prospectus. (i) The Company will, from the Closing Date to the Release Date (as defined in the Indenture), maintain and preserve its title to the Mortgaged Property (as defined in the Indenture) and the lien of the Indenture, subject to the terms of the Indenture. (j) Promptly from time to time the Company will take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Bonds for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for so long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Bonds; provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction. (k) Until the 30th day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities of the Company in the same market as the Bonds. 5. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the accuracy, as of the date hereof and the Closing Date (as if made at the Closing Date, unless another date is specified in such representation or warranty), of the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in a timely fashion in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof, the Registration Statement and all post-effective 15

(i) On the date hereof and the Closing Date you shall have received letters from Deloitte & Touche LLP, dated respectively the date hereof and the Closing Date and addressed to you, confirming that they are independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations, and stating, as of the date of such letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is given or incorporated in the Prospectus as of a date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, provided that such date shall be after the date of the Prospectus), the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other matters covered by its letter delivered to you concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and, with respect to the letter delivered on the Closing Date, confirming the conclusions and findings set forth in such prior letter. (j) You shall have been furnished by the Company such additional documents and certificates as you or counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request. (k) At the time of the Closing, the Company shall have received written confirmation from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation, as applicable, that on or prior to the effective date of the Plan, the Company's senior debt will have a rating of at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor's Corporation. Since the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any downgrading with respect to any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act or 17
any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any such debt securities (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading of such rating). (l) The Company shall have good and valid title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real property and all personal property subject to the liens of the Indenture, in each case free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims (i) except for such liens, encumbrances, equities or claims as are described in the Prospectus or are permitted by the Indenture and (ii) except for such defects in title as are not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use made or to be made of such property by the Company, materially impair the liens of the Indenture or have a material adverse effect on (x) the condition (financial or other), results of operations or business of the Company or (y) the authority or the ability of the Company to enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement or the Bonds. (m) Other than (i) the financing statements, fixture filings or other instruments similar in effect under any applicable law filed in connection with the First and Refunding Mortgage, dated as of December 1, 1920, between the Company and BNY Western Trust Company, as successor trustee, as heretofore amended and supplemented and (ii) the financing statements filed or to be filed on the Closing Date in favor of the Trustee (which financings statements are identified on Schedule II hereto), no effective financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar in effect under any applicable law covering all or any part of the property subject to the liens of the Indenture shall be on file in any filing or recording office except for financing statements, fixture filings or other instruments similar in effect under any applicable law filed in connection with Permitted Liens (as defined in the Indenture).

All conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan shall have been satisfied or waived except for the closing of the sale of the Bonds under this Agreement and the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 8.2(f) and 8.2(h) of the Plan. (q) On or prior to the Closing Date, (i) no stay of the Confirmation Order shall have been granted and (ii) no appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's denial of a stay of the Confirmation Order or other legal or governmental action challenging the Plan or the confirmation thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or the offering of the Bonds by the Underwriters shall have been filed on or after the date hereof, the effect of which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, makes it inadvisable or 18
impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Bonds on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents shall be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and to counsel for the Underwriters. The Company shall furnish to the Representatives conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents in such number as the Representatives shall reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date, by the Representatives. Any such cancellation shall be without liability of the Underwriters to the Company. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing, or by facsimile or telephone and confirmed in writing. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or (B) any roadshow or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically) (the "MARKETING MATERIALS"), (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any Marketing Materials a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Bonds or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company will not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct); and shall reimburse each Underwriter promptly after receipt of invoices from such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments shall be promptly refunded; provided, however, that (I) the Company shall not be liable under this paragraph 6(a) in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters expressly for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented and (II) with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in, or omission or alleged omission from, any 19
Preliminary Prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of an Underwriter (or its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, which controls such Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Bonds if (A) other than as a result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 4(b) hereof, a copy of the Prospectus was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Bonds to such person and (B) the Prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. (b) Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or (B) any Marketing Materials or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any Marketing Materials, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and shall reimburse the Company promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments shall be promptly refunded; provided, however, that such indemnification or reimbursement shall be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter expressly for use therein. (c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense 20
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; except that the Underwriters shall have the right to employ counsel to represent the Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under such subsection if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm or attorney (in addition to one local counsel) at any one time for all such indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related action in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Bonds or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Bonds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue 21
statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Bonds underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it shall promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in subsection (c) above). (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have, and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 7. Substitution of Underwriters. If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Bonds which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Bonds set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Bonds less the principal amount of the Bonds the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Bonds which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Bonds if the total principal amount of the Bonds which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Bonds, and any non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase 22
more than 110% of the principal amount of the Bonds set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to you who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Bonds. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Bonds that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 6 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 7. Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default. If the non defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to you are obligated or agree to purchase the Bonds of a defaulting Underwriter, either you or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order to effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. 8. Effective Date and Termination. (a) This Agreement shall become effective (i) if the Effective Date is on or before the date of this Agreement, at 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the next Business Day following the date hereof, (ii) if the Effective Date is after the date of this Agreement, at 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the first full Business Day (as defined in Section 13 hereof) following the Effective Date or (iii) at such earlier time after the Registration Statement becomes effective as you shall first release the Bonds for sale to the public.

Until this Agreement is effective, it may be terminated by the Company by giving notice as hereinafter provided to you, or by you by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company except that the provisions of Section 4(e) and Section 6 hereof shall at all times be effective. For purposes of this Agreement, the release of the initial public offering of the Bonds for sale to the public shall be deemed to have been made when you release, by telegram or otherwise, firm offers of the Bonds to securities dealers or release for publication a newspaper advertisement relating to the Bonds, whichever occurs first. (b) Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Underwriters' obligation hereunder is not fulfilled, (iii) trading in the Preferred Stock of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission or the American Stock Exchange, (iv) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange by the Commission or such exchange or other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction or there shall have been a material disruption in the settlement of securities which, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it inadvisable or impractical to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Bonds, or a banking 23
moratorium is declared by either federal or New York State authorities, (v) the United States becomes engaged in hostilities or there is an escalation of hostilities involving the United States or there is a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or an act of terrorism shall have occurred which, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it inadvisable or impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Bonds or (vi) there shall have been such a material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions, or the effect of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such, as to, in the judgment of the Representatives, make it inadvisable or impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Bonds. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(e) and 6 hereof. Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 10 hereof in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, shall be immediately confirmed in writing. 9. Survival of Certain Provisions. The agreements contained in Section 6 hereof and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in Sections 1 and 4 hereof shall survive the delivery of the Bonds to the Underwriters hereunder and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 10. Notices. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, (a) whenever notice is required by the provisions of this Agreement to be given to the Company, such notice shall be in writing or by facsimile addressed to the Company at One Market, Spear Tower, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: General Counsel (fax number: 415-267-7257); (b) whenever notice is required by the provisions of this Agreement to be given to the several Underwriters, such notice shall be in writing or by telegraph addressed to you in care of Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 Seventh Ave, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Debt Capital Markets, Power Group (fax number: 212-526-0943), with a copy to the General Counsel, and in care of UBS Securities LLC, 677 Washington Blvd. Stamford, Connecticut 06901, Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate (fax number: 203-719-0495), with a copy to the General Counsel. 11.

INDENTURE OF MORTGAGE (this "Indenture"), dated as of March 11, 2004 between PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California (the "Company"), and BNY WESTERN TRUST COMPANY, a California banking corporation, as Trustee (the "Trustee").

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. Whenever, subsequent to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board Resolution, Officer's Certificate, Expert's Certificate, Opinion of Counsel or other document or instrument, a clerical, typographical or other inadvertent or unintentional error or omission shall be discovered therein, a new document or instrument may be substituted therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of the actual execution and/or delivery thereof, such substitute document or instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date or dates required with respect to the document or instrument for which it is substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action has been taken by or at the request of the Company which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Bonds issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefit of the lien of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Bonds, except as aforesaid. SECTION 1.06. ACTS OF HOLDERS. (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing or, alternatively, may be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article XV, or a combination of such instruments and any such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Bond, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 11.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 15.06. (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof or may -30-
be proved in any other manner which the Trustee and the Company deem sufficient. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. (c) The ownership, principal amount (except as otherwise contemplated in clause (y) of the first proviso to the definition of Outstanding) and serial numbers of Bonds held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Bond Register. (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder shall bind every future Holder of the same Bond and the Holder of every Bond issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Bond. (e) Until such time as written instruments shall have been delivered to the Trustee with respect to the requisite percentage of principal amount of Bonds for the action contemplated by such instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such Bonds by written notice by such Holder or any subsequent Holder, proven in the manner in which such instrument was proven. (f) Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after any Act of Holders may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such Act of Holders. If the Company shall so determine, new Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Bonds of such series or Tranche. (g) The Company may, at its option, by Company Order, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act solicited by the Company, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. In addition, the Trustee may, at its option, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to join in the giving or making of any Notice of Default, any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 10.02, any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 10.11 or any direction referred to in Section 10.16. If any such record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, or such notice, declaration, request or direction, may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining (i) whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding Bonds have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act (and for that purpose the Outstanding Bonds shall be computed as of the record date) and/or (ii) which Holders may revoke any such Act (notwithstanding subsection (e) of this Section); and any such Act, given as aforesaid, shall be effective whether or not the Holders which authorized or agreed or consented to such Act remain Holders after such record date and whether or not the Bonds held by such Holders remain Outstanding after such record date. -31-
SECTION 1.07. NOTICES, ETC. TO TRUSTEE AND COMPANY. Except as otherwise provided herein, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made or served upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company, or the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder, shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise expressly provided herein) if the same shall be in writing and delivered personally to the addressee (which delivery, with respect to the Trustee, shall be made to its Corporate Trust Office and addressed to the attention of the Corporate Trust Department), or transmitted by facsimile transmission or other direct written electronic means to such telephone number or other electronic communications address as the parties hereto shall from time to time designate, or transmitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight courier guaranteeing next day delivery, charges prepaid, to the applicable address set forth opposite such party's name below or to such other address as either party hereto may from time to time designate: If to the Trustee, to: BNY Western Trust Company 550 Kearny Street, Suite 600 San Francisco, California 94108 Attention: Corporate Trust Administration Fax: (415) 399-1647 If to the Company, to: Pacific Gas and Electric Company 77 Beale Street (street address) P.O.

SECTION 1.08. NOTICE TO HOLDERS OF BONDS; WAIVER. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given, and shall be deemed given, to Holders if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Bond Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. -32-
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event otherwise to be specified therein, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. SECTION 1.09. CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required or deemed to be included in this Indenture by any provision of the Trust Indenture Act, the provision required or deemed to be included by the Trust Indenture Act shall control; and if any provision hereof otherwise conflicts with the Trust Indenture Act, or limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by Section 318(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trust Indenture Act, including the duties imposed by Section 318(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, shall control. SECTION 1.10. EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS. The Article and Section headings in this Indenture and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.11. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company and the Trustee shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 1.12. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE. In case any provision in this Indenture or the Bonds shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 1.13. BENEFITS OF INDENTURE. Nothing in this Indenture or the Bonds, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. -33-
SECTION 1.14. GOVERNING LAW. This Indenture and the Bonds shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereunder, except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable. SECTION 1.15. LEGAL HOLIDAYS. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Bond shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Bonds other than a provision in Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or in the indenture supplemental hereto, Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate which establishes the terms of the Bonds of such series or Tranche, which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section) payment of interest or principal and premium, if any, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, and, if such payment is made or duly provided for on such Business Day, no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day. SECTION 1.16. INVESTMENT OF CASH HELD BY TRUSTEE. Any cash held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent under any provision of this Indenture shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.06 or in Article IX, at the request of the Company evidenced by Company Order, be invested or reinvested in Investment Securities designated by the Company (such Company Order to contain a representation to the effect that the securities designated therein constitute Investment Securities), and any interest on such Investment Securities shall be promptly paid over to the Company as received free and clear of any Lien. Such Investment Securities shall be held subject to the same provisions hereof as the cash used to purchase the same, but upon a like request of the Company shall be sold, in whole or in designated part, and the proceeds of such sale shall be held subject to the same provisions hereof as the cash used to purchase the Investment Securities so sold. If such sale shall produce a net sum less than the cost of the Investment Securities so sold, the Company shall pay to the Trustee or any such Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amount in cash as, together with the net proceeds from such sale, shall equal the cost of the Investment Securities so sold, and if such sale shall produce a net sum greater than the cost of the Investment Securities so sold, the Trustee or any such Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly pay over to the Company an amount in cash equal to such excess, free and clear of any Lien. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any loss incurred in connection with the sale of any Investment Security pursuant to this Section. In the absence of a Company Order directing the Trustee to invest cash held by the Trustee hereunder, the Company hereby directs the Trustee to invest such cash in Government Obligations having maturities of less than one year until the Trustee shall have received a Company Order directing the Trustee to invest such cash in another Investment Security. The Trustee shall not be accountable or liable for any losses resulting from the sale or depreciation in the market value of investments made pursuant to this Indenture and Company Orders. -34-
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, interest on Investment Securities and any gain upon the sale thereof shall be held as part of the Mortgaged Property until such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived, whereupon such interest and gain shall be promptly paid over to the Company free and clear of any Lien. ARTICLE II BOND FORMS SECTION 2.01. FORMS GENERALLY. The definitive Bonds of each series shall be in substantially the form or forms established in the indenture supplemental hereto establishing such series, or in a Board Resolution establishing such series, or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to such a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, in any case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Bonds, as evidenced by their execution of the Bonds. If the form or forms of Bonds of any series are established in a Board Resolution or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution, such Board Resolution and Officer's Certificate, if any, shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 5.01 for the authentication and delivery of such Bonds. The Bonds of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons. The definitive Bonds shall be produced in such manner as shall be determined by the officers executing such Bonds, as evidenced by their execution thereof. SECTION 2.02.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to authenticate and deliver Bonds of any series the terms of which, established as contemplated by this Section, would adversely affect the rights, duties, obligations, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 3.02. DENOMINATIONS. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Bonds, or any Tranche thereof, the Bonds of each series shall be issuable in denominations of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) and any integral multiple thereof. -39-
SECTION 3.03. EXECUTION, DATING, CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Bonds, or any Tranche thereof, the Bonds shall be executed on behalf of the Company by any two of the following: the President, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer. The corporate seal of the Company may be affixed thereto or reproduced thereon and attested by any Authorized Officer. The signature of any or all of these officers on the Bonds may be manual or facsimile. Bonds bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time of execution the President, the Chief Executive Officer, a Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Bonds or did not hold such offices at the date of such Bonds. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Bonds, or any Tranche thereof, each Bond shall be dated the date of its authentication. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to any series of Bonds, or any Tranche thereof, no Bond shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Bond a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer thereof, and such certificate upon any Bond shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Bond has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Bond shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder to the Company, or any Person acting on its behalf, but shall never have been issued and sold (or pledged) by the Company, and (a) the Company shall deliver such Bond to the Bond Registrar for cancellation or shall cancel such Bond and deliver evidence of such cancellation to the Trustee, in each case as provided in Section 3.09, and (b) the Company, at its election, shall deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.04 and need not be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Bond has never been issued and sold (or pledged) by the Company, then, for all purposes of this Indenture, such Bond shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof. SECTION 3.04. TEMPORARY BONDS. Pending the preparation of definitive Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Bonds which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which they are issued, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Bonds may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Bonds. -40-
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, after the preparation of definitive Bonds of such series or Tranche, the temporary Bonds of such series or Tranche shall be exchangeable, without charge to the Holder thereof, for definitive Bonds of such series or Tranche upon surrender of such temporary Bonds at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 7.02 in a Place of Payment for such Bonds. Upon such surrender of temporary Bonds, the Company shall, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Bonds of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, temporary Bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Bonds of the same series and Tranche and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 3.05. REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. The Company shall cause to be kept in one of the offices designated pursuant to Section 7.02, with respect to the Bonds of each series, or any Tranche thereof, a register (the "Bond Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Bonds of such series or Tranche and the registration of transfer thereof. Pursuant to Section 3.01(f), the Company shall designate one Person to maintain the Bond Register for the Bonds of each series, and such Person is referred to herein, with respect to such series, as the "Bond Registrar." Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of its offices as an office in which a Bond Register with respect to the Bonds of one or more series, or any Tranche or Tranches thereof, shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself the Bond Registrar with respect to one or more of such series. The Bond Register(s) shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and the Company at all reasonable times. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, and except as provided below with respect to Global Bonds, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Bond of such series or Tranche at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 7.02 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Bonds of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, any Bond of such series or Tranche may be exchanged at the option of the Holder, for one or more new Bonds of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Bonds to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Bonds are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Bonds which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. -41-
All Bonds delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Bonds shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same obligation, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Bonds surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Bond presented or surrendered for registration of transfer shall be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Every Bond presented or surrendered for exchange shall (if so required by the Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Bonds, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 6.06 or 14.06 not involving any transfer. The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, during a period of fifteen (15) days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers of the Bonds of such series or Tranche called for redemption or (b) any Bond so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Bond being redeemed in part. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Bonds in definitive form, a Global Bond representing all or a portion of the Bonds of a series, or Tranche thereof, may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series or Tranche to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series, or Tranche thereof, or a nominee of such successor Depositary. If at any time (i) the Depositary for the Bonds of a series, or a Tranche thereof, notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Bonds of such series or Tranche or that it is no longer eligible under Section 3.13, and in any such case the Company has not appointed a successor Depositary within 90 days after delivery of such notice, (ii) there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default, or (iii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, issued in the form of one or more Global Bonds shall no longer be represented by such Global Bond or Bonds, then in each such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Bonds of such series or Tranche, will authenticate and deliver, Bonds of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Bond or Bonds representing such series or Tranche in exchange for such Global Bond or Bonds. -42-
In addition, if specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a series of Bonds, or Tranche thereof, the Depositary for such series of Bonds may surrender a Global Bond for such series or Tranche of Bonds in exchange in whole or in part for Bonds of such series or Tranche in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall authenticate and deliver, without charge: (i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Bond or Bonds of the same series or Tranche, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Bonds; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Bond in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Bond and the aggregate principal amount of Bonds delivered to Holders thereof. Bonds issued in exchange for a Global Bond pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Bond, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Bonds to the Persons in whose names such Bonds are so registered. SECTION 3.06. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN BONDS. If any mutilated Bond is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Bond of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction, loss or theft of any Bond and (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Bond is held by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Bond, a new Bond of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Bond has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, but subject to compliance with the foregoing conditions, instead of issuing a new Bond, pay such Bond. Upon the issuance of any new Bond under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. -43-
Every new Bond of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Bond shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Bond shall be at any time enforceable by anyone other than the Holder of such new Bond, and any such new Bond shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Bonds of such series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Bonds. SECTION 3.07. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on any Bond which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Bond (or one or more Predecessor Bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Bonds of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of a Bond shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. The initial payment of interest on any Bond of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Bond or in a Board Resolution, Officer's Certificate or supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the related series of Bonds. Except in the case of a Global Bond at the option of the Company, interest on any series of Bonds may be paid by (i) check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it shall appear on the Bond Register of such series or (ii) wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as designated in writing by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Bond Register of such series. Any interest on any Bond of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the related Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below: (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Bonds of such series (or their respective Predecessor Bonds) are registered at the close of business on a date (herein called a "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than thirty (30) days and not less than ten (10) days -44-
prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than twenty-five (25) days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to such Special Record Date, cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Bonds of such series. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Bonds of such series (or their respective Predecessor Bonds) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date. (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Bonds of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Bonds may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.05, each Bond delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Bond shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Bond. SECTION 3.08. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Bond is registered as the absolute owner of such Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest, if any, on such Bond and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Bond be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 3.09. CANCELLATION BY BOND REGISTRAR. All Bonds surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Bond Registrar, be delivered to the Bond Registrar and, if not theretofore canceled, shall be promptly canceled by the Bond Registrar. The Company may at any time deliver to the Bond Registrar for cancellation any Bonds previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever or which the Company shall not have issued and sold (or pledged), and all Bonds so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Bond Registrar. No Bonds shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Bonds canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Bonds held by the Bond Registrar shall be disposed of in accordance with the Bond Registrar's then customary practice for disposing of securities, unless otherwise directed by a Company Order. SECTION 3.10. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on the Bonds of each series shall be computed on the basis of a -45-
three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) thirty (30) day months and, with respect to any period less than a full calendar month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period. SECTION 3.11. PAYMENT TO BE IN PROPER CURRENCY. In the case of the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the "Required Currency"), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Bonds as contemplated by Section 3.01, the obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium, if any, or interest, if any, thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including without limitation the risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company, the Company shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct. SECTION 3.12. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company, in issuing the Bonds, may use "CUSIP" or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee or Bond Registrar may use CUSIP or such other numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Bonds or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Bonds, in which case none of the Company or, as the case may be, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, or any agent of any of them, shall have any liability in respect of any CUSIP number used on any such notice, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. SECTION 3.13. GLOBAL BONDS. If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01(q) that the Bonds of a series, or a Tranche thereof, are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Bonds, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Company Order with respect to such series or Tranche, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Bonds in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of such series or Tranche, to be represented by one or more Global Bonds, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Bond or Bonds or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instruction or held by the Trustee as custodian for the Depositary, and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for -46-
Bonds in definitive form, this Bond may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary." The Company may at any time designate another Person to act as Depositary in place of the Person designated pursuant to Section 3.01(q). Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01(q) or otherwise for a Global Bond must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation. ARTICLE IV BONDS OF THE INITIAL SERIES There are hereby established five series of Bonds (herein sometimes referred to as "Bonds of the First Series," "Bonds of the Second Series," "Bonds of the Third Series," "Bonds of the Fourth Series" and "Bonds of the Fifth Series" and collectively as "Bonds of the Initial Series"). The form, designation and terms of the Bonds of the Initial Series and the establishment of any additional series comprising Bonds of the Initial Series or the elimination of any series comprising Bonds of the Initial Series established by this Article but not issued shall be established in a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution, and/or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution in accordance with Section 3.01. ARTICLE V ISSUANCE OF BONDS SECTION 5.01. GENERAL. Prior to the Release Date and subject to the provisions of Section 5.02, 5.03 or 5.04, whichever may be applicable, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Bonds of a series, for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of: (a) the instrument or instruments establishing the form or forms and terms of such series, as provided in Sections 2.01 and 3.01; (b) a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of such Bonds and, to the extent that the terms of such Bonds shall not have been established in an indenture supplemental hereto or in a Board Resolution, or in an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, all as contemplated by Section 3.01, either (i) establishing such terms or (ii) in the case of Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, specifying procedures by which such terms are to be established (which procedures may provide for authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or any agent or agents thereof, which oral instructions are to be promptly confirmed electronically -47-
or in writing), in either case in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above; (c) the Bonds of such series, executed on behalf of the Company by an officer specified in Section 3.03; (d) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that: (i) the form or forms of such Bonds have been duly authorized by the Company and have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (ii) the terms of such Bonds have been duly authorized by the Company and have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (iii) when such Bonds shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, such Bonds will constitute valid obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefit of the lien of this Indenture, equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Bonds without any priority of any one Bond over any other Bond; provided, however, that, with respect to Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication and delivery of such Bonds (provided that such Opinion of Counsel addresses the authentication and delivery of all such Bonds) and that, in lieu of the opinions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, counsel may opine that: (x) when the terms of such Bonds shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders or pursuant to such procedures as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order or Orders, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above, such terms will have been duly authorized by the Company and will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (y) when such Bonds shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and the Company Order or Orders or the specified procedures referred to in paragraph (x) above and issued and delivered by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, such Bonds will constitute valid obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefit of the lien of the Indenture, equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Bonds without any priority of any one Bond over any other Bond; (e) an Officer's Certificate to the effect that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided, however, that with respect to Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, either (i) such an Officer's Certificate shall be delivered at the time of the authentication and delivery of each Bond of such series or (ii) the Officer's Certificate delivered at or prior to the time of the first authentication and delivery of the Bonds of such series shall state that the statements therein shall be deemed to be made at the time of each, or each subsequent, authentication and delivery of Bonds of such series; -48-
(f) such other Opinions of Counsel, certificates and other documents as may be required under Section 5.02, 5.03 or 5.04, whichever may be applicable to the authentication and delivery of the Bonds of such series; and (g) except with respect to the issuance of the Bonds of the Initial Series, a Net Earnings Certificate showing the Net Income of the Company for the period therein specified to have been not less than an amount equal to two (2) times the Annual Interest Requirements therein specified; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be entitled to receive a Net Earnings Certificate hereunder if the Bonds of such series are to have no Stated Interest Rate prior to Maturity; and provided, further, that, with respect to Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, other than Bonds theretofore authenticated and delivered, (i) it shall be assumed in the Net Earnings Certificate delivered in connection with the authentication and delivery of Bonds of such series that none of the Bonds of such series not yet authenticated and delivered shall have a Stated Interest Rate in excess of a maximum rate to be stated therein, and thereafter no Bonds of such series which would have a Stated Interest Rate at the time of the initial authentication and delivery thereof in excess of such maximum rate shall be authenticated and delivered under the authority of such Net Earnings Certificate but instead shall only be authenticated and delivered under the authority of a new Net Earnings Certificate which complies with the requirements of this clause (g), including the proviso relating to Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, and (ii) so long as the Stated Interest Rate that Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering bear at the time of the initial authentication and delivery thereof does not exceed the maximum rate assumed in the most recent Net Earnings Certificate delivered with respect to the Bonds of such series, the Trustee shall not be entitled to receive a new Net Earnings Certificate at the time of any subsequent authentication and delivery of the Bonds of such series (unless such Bonds are authenticated and delivered on or after the date which is two (2) years after the most recent Net Earnings Certificate with respect to such series was delivered pursuant to this clause (g), in which case this subclause (ii) shall not apply). For purposes of clause (g), "Net Earnings Certificate" means a certificate signed by an Authorized Officer and an Accountant stating: (1) the "Net Income" of the Company for a period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months within the eighteen (18) calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the month in which the Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery under this Indenture of Bonds is delivered to the Trustee specifying: (A) its operating revenues (which may include revenues of the Company subject to possible refund at a future date); (B) its expenses, excluding (i) expenses for taxes paid or accrued on income or profits and other taxes measured by, or dependent on, net income, (ii) provisions for reserves for renewals, replacements, depreciation, amortization, depletion or retirement of property (or any expenditures therefor), (iii) expenses or provisions for interest on any indebtedness of the Company (including interest on Capital Lease Obligations), for the amortization of debt discount, premium, expense or loss on reacquired debt, for the amortization of payments made on Swap Agreements, for any maintenance and replacement, improvement or sinking fund or other device for the retirement of any indebtedness, or for other amortization, (iv) expenses, -49-
losses or provisions for any non-recurring or extraordinary charge to income or to retained earnings of whatever kind or nature (including, without limitation, the recognition of expense or impairment due to the non-recoverability of assets or expense, charges for changes in accounting principles recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and non-cash writedowns, book losses or other charges) ("Non-Recurring Charges"), whether or not recorded as a non-recurring or extraordinary charge in the Company's books of account, and (v) provisions for any refund of revenues previously collected or accrued by the Company subject to possible refund; (C) the amount remaining after deducting the amount required to be stated in such certificate by clause (B) above from the amount required to be stated therein by clause (A) above; (D) its other income, net of related expenses (excluding Non-Recurring Charges, whether or not recorded as non-recurring or extraordinary charges on the Company's books of account), including, but not limited to, non-utility operating income, cash distributions received from subsidiaries of the Company, any allowance for funds used during construction, and including any portion of such allowance, or of any such analogous amounts, not included in "other items" (or any analogous item) in the Company's books of account, and other deferred costs (or any analogous amounts) in the Company's books of account; and any amounts collected by others to be applied to debt service on indebtedness of the Company, and not otherwise treated on the Company's books as revenue; and (E) the Net Income of the Company for such period of twelve (12) consecutive calendar months (being the sum of the amounts required to be stated in such certificate by clauses (C) and (D) above); and (2) the "Annual Interest Requirements," being the interest requirements for one year, at the respective Stated Interest Rates, if any, borne prior to Maturity, upon: (A) all Bonds Outstanding hereunder at the date of such certificate (excluding any Bonds that will be paid or redeemed through Bonds described in (B) below); provided, however, that, if Outstanding Bonds of any series or Tranche bear interest at a variable rate or rates, then the interest requirement on the Bonds of such series or Tranche shall be determined by reference to the rate or rates in effect on two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the date of such certificate; (B) all Bonds then applied for in pending applications for the original issuance of Bonds, including the application in connection with which such certificate is made; provided, however, that if Bonds of any series or Tranche are to bear interest at a variable rate or rates, then the interest requirement on the Bonds of such series or Tranche shall be determined by reference to the rate or rates to be in effect at the time of the initial authentication and delivery of such Bonds or, if such rate or rates are not determinable at such time, then by reference to the Company's good faith estimate of the rate or rates to be in effect at the time of the initial authentication and delivery of such Bonds; and provided, further, that the determination of the interest requirement on Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering shall be further subject to the other provisions of clause (g) above; and -50-
(C) the principal amount of all other indebtedness secured by a Senior Lien upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof (except (i) indebtedness of the Company the repayment of which supports or is supported by other indebtedness included in Annual Interest Requirements pursuant to one of the other clauses of this definition and (ii) indebtedness outstanding on the date of such certificate secured by a Prepaid Lien upon Mortgaged Property outstanding on the date of such certificate and secured by a lien on a parity with or prior to the lien of this Indenture upon Mortgaged Property), if such indebtedness has been issued, assumed or guaranteed by the Company or if the Company customarily pays the interest upon the principal thereof; provided, however, that if any such indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate or rates, then the interest requirement on such indebtedness shall be determined by reference to the rate or rates in effect two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the date of such certificate. If any of the property of the Company owned by it at the time of the making of any Net Earnings Certificate (a) shall have been acquired during or after any period for which Net Income of the Company are to be computed, (b) shall not have been acquired in exchange or substitution for property the net earnings of which have been included in the Net Income of the Company and (c) had been operated as a separate unit and items of revenue and expense attributable thereto are readily ascertainable by the Company, then the net earnings of such property (computed in the manner that clause (g) above provides for the computation of the Net Income of the Company) during such period or such part of such period as shall have preceded the acquisition thereof, to the extent that the same have not otherwise been included in the Net Income of the Company, shall be so included. In any case where a Net Earnings Certificate is required as a condition precedent to the authentication and delivery of Bonds, such certificate shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an Independent Accountant if the aggregate principal amount of Bonds then applied for plus the aggregate principal amount of Bonds authenticated and delivered hereunder since the commencement of the then current calendar year (other than those with respect to which a Net Earnings Certificate is not required, or with respect to which a Net Earnings Certificate accompanied by a certificate signed by an Independent Accountant has previously been furnished to the Trustee) is ten percent (10%) or more of the sum of (a) the principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, which certificate shall provide that such Independent Accountant has reviewed the Net Earnings Certificate and that such Independent Accountant has no knowledge that any statements in such Net Earnings Certificate are not true; but no such certificate need be signed by an Independent Accountant, as to dates or periods not covered by annual reports required to be filed by the Company, with respect to conditions precedent which depend upon a state of facts as of a date or dates or for a period or periods different from that required to be covered by such annual reports. With respect to Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Bonds, the forms and terms thereof, the validity thereof and the compliance of the authentication and delivery thereof with the terms and conditions of this Indenture, upon the Opinion or Opinions of Counsel and the certificates and other documents delivered pursuant to this Article V at or prior to the time of the first authentication and delivery of Bonds of such series until (i) such time as the Trustee has received written notice that any of such opinions, certificates or other documents have been -51-
superseded or revoked or (ii) such opinions, certificates or other documents expire by their terms. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Bonds of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Company's instructions to authenticate and deliver such Bonds do not violate any applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Company. SECTION 5.02. ISSUANCE OF BONDS ON THE BASIS OF PROPERTY ADDITIONS.

(b) Bonds of any series shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee on the basis of the deposit of cash when the Trustee shall have received, in addition to such deposit, the documents with respect to the Bonds of such series specified in Section 5.01. (c) All cash deposited with the Trustee under the provisions of this Section (herein referred to as "Deposited Cash") shall be held by the Trustee, shall constitute Mortgaged Property and may be withdrawn from time to time by the Company free and clear of any Lien, upon delivery of a Company Order to the Trustee, in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Bonds to the authentication and delivery of which the Company shall be entitled under Section 5.02 or 5.03 hereof. In case such withdrawal of Deposited Cash is, in whole or in part, based upon Property Additions which constitute Unfunded Property, the Company shall comply with Section 5.02 as if such Property Additions were being made the basis for the authentication and delivery of Bonds thereon equivalent in principal amount to the amount of the Deposited Cash to be withdrawn on such basis; or in case the withdrawal of Deposited Cash is, in whole or in part, based upon the right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds based on the delivery to the Trustee of Retired Bonds, the Company shall comply with Section 5.03 relating to such authentication and delivery, recognizing that, in each such case, the action being taken is the withdrawal of Deposited Cash rather than the authentication and delivery of Bonds; provided, however, that the Company shall not in any event be required to deliver the documents specified in Section 5.01 or the Accountant's Certificate specified in Section 5.02(b)(vi). Any withdrawal of Deposited Cash under this subsection (c) shall operate as a waiver by the Company of its right to the authentication and delivery of the Bonds on which such withdrawal is based and such Bonds may not thereafter be authenticated and delivered hereunder. Any Property Additions which have been made the basis of any such right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds so waived shall be deemed to have been made the basis of the withdrawal of such Deposited Cash and shall constitute Funded Property hereunder; and any Retired Bonds which have been made the basis of any such right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds so waived shall be deemed to have been made the basis of the withdrawal of such Deposited Cash. (d) If at any time the Company shall so direct, any Deposited Cash may be used or applied to the purchase, payment or redemption of Bonds in the manner and subject to the conditions provided in clauses (d) and (e) of Section 8.07. -55-
ARTICLE VI REDEMPTION OF BONDS SECTION 6.01. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Bonds of such series or Tranche) in accordance with this Article. SECTION 6.02. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The election of the Company to redeem any Bonds shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate. The Company shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of such Bonds to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Bonds (a) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Bonds or elsewhere in this Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Bonds, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition. SECTION 6.03. SELECTION OF BONDS TO BE REDEEMED. If less than all the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, are to be redeemed, the particular Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the Bond Registrar from the Outstanding Bonds of such series or Tranche not previously called for redemption, by such method as shall be provided for any particular series or Tranche, or, in the absence of any such provision, by such method of random selection as the Bond Registrar shall deem fair and appropriate and which may, in any case, provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Bonds of such series or Tranche or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Bonds of such series or Tranche having a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Bonds of such series or Tranche; provided, however, that if, as indicated in an Officer's Certificate, the Company shall have offered to purchase all or any principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding of any series, or any Tranche thereof, and less than all of such Bonds as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered to the Company for such purchase, the Bond Registrar, if so directed by Company Order, shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Bonds which have not been so tendered. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify the Company and the Trustee in writing of the Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bonds selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Bonds shall relate, in the case of any Bonds redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Bonds which has been or is to be redeemed. -56-

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Bonds, or any Tranche thereof, in accordance with Section 3.01, with respect to any redemption of Bonds at the election of the Company or any redemption which is contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or condition which cannot be ascertained prior to the time a redemption notice is required to be given hereunder, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon receipt by the Trustee or the Paying Agent or Agents for such Bonds, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of such Bonds and accrued interest, if any, thereon to the Redemption Date (or direction from the Company to apply such money for the payment of such Bonds, if such money shall have been deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents upon the condition that the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents will apply such money only at the direction of the Company) and that if such money shall not have been so received (or if such money shall have been received but the Trustee or the Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to apply such money to redeem such Bonds) such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Bonds; provided, however, that conditional notice shall not be given if upon the giving of notice, such Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with Section 9.01. In the event that -57-
such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, or the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to apply such money to the redemption of such Bonds, the redemption shall not be made, and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received or that the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to redeem such Bonds and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents for the Bonds otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Bonds which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption. Notice of redemption of Bonds to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Bond Registrar in the name and at the expense of the Company. Notice of mandatory redemption of Bonds shall be given by the Bond Registrar in the name and at the expense of the Company. SECTION 6.05. BONDS PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Bonds or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Bonds or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Bond for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Bond or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to such Bond; and provided, further, that, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to such Bond, any installment of interest on any Bond the Stated Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holder of such Bond, or one or more Predecessor Bonds, registered as such at the close of business on the related Regular Record Date according to the terms of such Bond and subject to the provisions of Section 3.07. SECTION 6.06. BONDS REDEEMED IN PART. Upon the surrender of any Bond which is to be redeemed only in part at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Bond, without service charge, a new Bond or Bonds of the same series and Tranche, of any authorized denomination requested by such Holder and of like tenor and in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Bond so surrendered. -58-

(a) The Company shall pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Bonds of each series in accordance with the terms of such Bonds and this Indenture. (b) At the Execution Date, the Company is lawfully possessed of the Mortgaged Property. Prior to the Release Date, the Company shall maintain and preserve its title to the Mortgaged Property and the lien of this Indenture so long as any Bonds shall remain Outstanding, subject, however, to the provisions of Article VIII and Article XIV. SECTION 7.02. MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY. The Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for the Bonds of each series, or any Tranche thereof, an office or agency where payment of such Bonds shall be made, and where the registration of transfer or exchange of such Bonds may be effected and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of such Bonds and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, payment of such Bonds shall be made, registration of transfer or exchange thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereof may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies with respect to the Bonds of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, for any or all of the foregoing purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any office or agency required by this Section may be maintained at an office of the Company, in which event the Company shall perform all functions to be performed at such office or agency. SECTION 7.03. MONEY FOR BOND PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any of such Bonds, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and premium or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by the -59-
Company (or any other obligor on such Bonds) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Bonds. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, it shall, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Bonds, deposit with such Paying Agents sums sufficient (without duplication) to pay the principal and premium or interest so becoming due, such sums to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any failure by it so to act. Upon their appointment as Paying Agent, the Company shall cause each Paying Agent for the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, other than the Company or the Trustee, to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent shall: (a) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Bonds in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (b) give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or any other obligor upon such Bonds) to make any payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Bonds; and (c) at any time during the continuance of any such failure, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent and furnish to the Trustee such information as it possesses regarding the names and addresses of the Persons entitled to such sums. The Company may at any time pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if so stated in a Company Order delivered to the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of Article IX; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Bond and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust without further action by the Company, Trustee or any Paying Agent; and, upon such payment or discharge, the Holder of such Bond shall, as an unsecured general creditor and not as the Holder of an Outstanding Bond, look only to the Company for payment of the amount so due and payable and remaining unpaid, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon -60-
cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment to the Company, shall, upon receipt of a Company Request and at the expense of the Company, cause to be mailed, on one occasion only, notice to such Holder that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company.

SECTION 7.06. PAYMENT OF TAXES; LIENS AND DISCHARGE OF LIENS. (a) Until the Release Date, the Company shall pay all taxes and assessments and other governmental charges lawfully levied or assessed upon the Mortgaged Property, or upon any part thereof, or upon the interest of the Trustee in the Mortgaged Property, before the same shall become delinquent, and shall make reasonable effort to observe and conform in all material respects to all valid requirements of any Governmental Authority relative to any of the Mortgaged Property and all covenants, terms and conditions upon or under which any of the Mortgaged Property is held. (b) Until the Release Date, the Company shall not create nor suffer to be created any Lien upon the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, prior to, or pari passu with, the lien of this Indenture, other than Permitted Liens; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as a subordination of the lien of this Indenture to any Permitted Liens encumbering any part of the Mortgaged Property except to the extent that such subordination occurs or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.11 or Section 11.07. Nothing in this Indenture shall be construed as prohibiting the creation or imposition of any Lien on the -61-
Mortgaged Property, so long as such Liens are subordinate in priority to the lien of this Indenture. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the Company shall not be required (i) to observe or conform to any requirement of a Governmental Authority or to cause to be paid or discharged, or to make provision for, any such Lien, or to pay any such tax, assessment or governmental charge so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith and by appropriate legal proceedings, (ii) to pay, discharge or make provisions for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge, the validity of which shall not be so contested if adequate security for the payment of such tax, assessment or other governmental charge and for any penalties or interest which may reasonably be anticipated from failure to pay the same shall be given to the Trustee or (iii) to pay, discharge or make provisions for any Liens existing on the Mortgaged Property on and as of the Execution Date; provided that the same constitute Permitted Liens; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall prohibit the issuance or other incurrence of additional indebtedness, or the refunding of outstanding indebtedness, secured by any Lien prior to the lien hereof which is permitted under this Section to continue to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not increase the principal amount of any Senior Lien Obligations secured by a Senior Lien on any Funded Property. SECTION 7.07. INSURANCE. (a) Subject to clause (e) below, the Company shall (i) keep or cause to be kept all Mortgaged Property insured against loss by fire, to the extent that property of similar character is usually so insured by companies similarly situated and operating like properties, to a reasonable amount, by reputable insurance companies, the proceeds of such insurance (except as to any Minor Loss) to be made payable, subject to applicable law, to the Trustee as the interest of the Trustee may appear, or to any holder of a Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations if the terms of the applicable Senior Lien require such payment, or (ii) in lieu of or supplementing such insurance in whole or in part, adopt some other method or plan of protection against loss by fire at least equal in protection to the method or plan of protection against loss by fire of companies similarly situated and operating properties subject to similar fire hazards or properties on which an equal primary fire insurance rate has been set by reputable insurance companies; and if the Company shall adopt such other method or plan of protection, it shall, subject to applicable law (and except as to any Minor Loss) pay to the Trustee on account of any loss covered by such method or plan an amount in cash equal to the amount of such loss less any amounts otherwise paid to the Trustee in respect of such loss or paid to any holder of a Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations in respect of such loss if the terms of the applicable Senior Lien require such payment. Any cash so required to be paid by the Company pursuant to any such method or plan shall for the purposes of this Indenture be deemed to be proceeds of insurance. In case of the adoption of such other method or plan of protection, the Company shall also furnish to the Trustee a certificate of an actuary or other qualified Person appointed by the Company with respect to the adequacy of such method or plan. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have fire insurance policies with (i) a deductible provision in a dollar amount per occurrence not exceeding the applicable Deductible Limit and/or (ii) co-insurance or self insurance provisions with a dollar -62-
amount per occurrence not exceeding thirty percent (30%) of the loss proceeds otherwise payable. (b) All moneys paid to the Trustee by the Company in accordance with this Section or received by the Trustee as proceeds of any insurance, in either case on account of a loss on or with respect to Funded Property, shall, subject to the requirements of any Senior Lien upon such Funded Property, be held by the Trustee, constitute Mortgaged Property, and, subject as aforesaid, shall be paid by it to the Company free and clear of any Lien to reimburse the Company for an equal amount expended or committed for expenditure in the rebuilding, renewal and/or replacement of or substitution for the property destroyed, damaged or otherwise lost (such property being referred to in this clause (b) as "lost property"), upon receipt by the Trustee of: (i) a Company Request requesting such payment; (ii) an Expert's Certificate: (A) describing the lost property; (B) stating the Funded Property Basis of such lost property or, if such damage, destruction or loss shall have affected only a portion of such Funded Property, stating the allocable portion of such Funded Property Basis (such allocation to be made on any reasonable basis as may be determined by the Company); (C) stating the amounts so expended or committed for expenditure in the rebuilding, renewal, replacement of and/or substitution for such lost property; and (D) stating (I) the Fair Value to the Company of such lost property as rebuilt or renewed or as to be rebuilt or renewed and/or of the replacement or substituted property (such rebuilt, renewed, replaced or substituted property being referred to in this clause (b) as the "replaced property"); provided, that, if any portion of such replaced property is an Acquired Facility and the Fair Value to the Company of such Acquired Facility as set forth in such Expert's Certificate is not a De Minimis Amount, then an Independent Expert shall opine as to the Fair Value to the Company of such Acquired Facility, (II) to the extent such replaced property is subject to a Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations, the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Lien Obligations as of the date of such certificate, and (III) the Net Fair Value of such replaced property; and (iii) an Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of the signer, the Indenture creates, or upon taking of the actions specified in such opinion, the Indenture will create, a lien on the replaced property. Any such moneys not so applied within thirty-six (36) months after its receipt by the Trustee, or in respect of which notice in writing of intention to apply the same to the work of rebuilding, renewal, replacement or substitution then in progress and uncompleted shall not have been given to the Trustee by the Company within such thirty-six (36) months, or which the Company shall at any time notify the Trustee is not to be so applied, shall thereafter be withdrawn, used or applied in the manner, to the extent and for the purposes, and subject to the conditions, provided in Section 8.07; provided, however, that (i) if the amount of such moneys -63-
shall exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the amount stated pursuant to clause (B) in the Expert's Certificate referred to above, or (ii) if any of such moneys remain after the Company shall have replaced the lost property with replaced property and the Net Fair Value of the replaced property is at least equal to the Funded Property Basis of the lost property, then in each case, the amount of such excess shall not be deemed to be Funded Cash, shall not be subject to Section 8.07 and shall be remitted to or upon the order of the Company free and clear of any Lien. All replaced property, to the extent that it has been built or acquired with the proceeds of Funded Cash pursuant to this clause (b), shall constitute Mortgaged Property and Funded Property. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if Mortgaged Property on or with respect to which a loss occurs constitutes Funded Property in part only, the Company may, at its election, obtain the reimbursement of insurance proceeds attributable to the part of such property which constitutes Funded Property under this subsection (b) and obtain the reimbursement of insurance proceeds attributable to the part of such property which constitutes Unfunded Property under subsection (c) of this Section. (c) All moneys paid to the Trustee by the Company in accordance with this Section or received by the Trustee as proceeds of any insurance, in either case on account of a loss on or with respect to Unfunded Property shall, subject to the requirements of any applicable Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations, be held by the Trustee, constitute Mortgaged Property, and, subject as aforesaid, shall be paid by it to the Company free and clear of any Lien upon receipt by the Trustee of: (i) a Company Request requesting such payment; (ii) an Expert's Certificate made and dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such Company Request, stating: (A) that such moneys were paid to or received by the Trustee on account of a loss on or with respect to Unfunded Property; (B) if true, (I) that the aggregate Adjusted Property Additions Basis of all Property Additions which constitute Unfunded Property (excluding, to the extent of such loss, the property on or with respect to which such loss was incurred), is not less than zero (0), or (II) that the amount of such loss does not exceed the aggregate Adjusted Property Additions Basis of all Property Additions acquired, made or constructed on or after the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date of the Company Request requesting such payment; and (C) if neither of the statements contemplated in subclause (B) above can be made, the amount by which zero (0) exceeds the amount referred to in subclause (B)(I) above (showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof) (such amount being referred to in this clause (c) as the "Make-up Amount"); and (iii) an amount in cash, to be held by the Trustee and to constitute Mortgaged Property, equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Make-up Amount if the -64-
Expert's Certificate required by clause (ii) above does not contain either of the statements contemplated in clause (ii)(B) above. To the extent that the Company shall be entitled to withdraw proceeds of insurance pursuant to this subsection (c), such proceeds shall be deemed not to constitute Funded Cash. (d) Whenever under the provisions of this Section the Company is required to deliver moneys to the Trustee and at the same time shall have satisfied the conditions set forth herein for payment of moneys by the Trustee to the Company, there shall be paid to or retained by the Trustee or paid to the Company, as the case may be, only the amount net of any taxes or other governmental charges, any administrative or other miscellaneous expenses of the insurance provider and any amounts allowed by this Indenture to be deducted from amounts payable to the Trustee. (e) Upon the occurrence of the Release Date, this Section 7.07 (other than this clause (e)) shall, automatically and without the need for any further action by any Person, cease to be in effect and the Trustee shall promptly pay to the Company free and clear of any Lien all moneys held by the Trustee pursuant to this Section. SECTION 7.08. RECORDING, FURTHER ASSURANCES. (a) Until the Release Date, the Company shall cause this Indenture and all indentures and instruments supplemental hereto (or notices, memoranda or financing statements or amendments thereto as may be recorded or filed to place third parties on notice thereof) to be promptly recorded and filed and re-recorded and re-filed in such manner and in such places, as may be required by law in order to fully preserve and protect the security of the Holders of the Bonds and all rights of the Trustee, and shall furnish to the Trustee: (i) promptly after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, as originally executed and delivered, and of each supplemental indenture, an Opinion of Counsel either stating that in the opinion of such counsel this Indenture or such supplemental indenture (or any other instrument, notice, memorandum or financing statement in connection therewith) has been properly recorded and filed so as to make effective the lien intended to be created hereby or thereby, and reciting the details of such action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to make such lien effective. The Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subsection (i) if (x) the Opinion of Counsel herein required to be delivered to the Trustee shall state that this Indenture or such supplemental indenture (or any other instrument, notice, memorandum or financing statement in connection therewith) has been received for record or filing in each jurisdiction in which it is required to be recorded or filed and that, in the opinion of such counsel (if such is the case), such receipt for record or filing makes effective the lien intended to be created by this Indenture or such supplemental indenture, and (y) such opinion is delivered to the Trustee within such time, following the date of execution of this Indenture, as originally executed and delivered, or such supplemental indenture, as shall be practicable having due regard to the number and distance of the jurisdictions in which this Indenture or such supplemental indenture (or such other instrument, notice, memorandum or financing statement in connection therewith) is required to be recorded or filed; and -65-
(ii) on or before June 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2005, an Opinion of Counsel stating either (x) that in the opinion of such counsel such action has been taken, since the date of the most recent Opinion of Counsel furnished pursuant to this subsection (ii) or the first Opinion of Counsel furnished pursuant to clause (i) of this subsection (a), with respect to the recording, filing, re-recording, and re-filing of this Indenture and of each indenture supplemental to this Indenture (or any other instrument, notice, memorandum or financing statement or amendments thereto in connection therewith), as is necessary to maintain the lien hereof, and reciting the details of such action, or (y) that in the opinion of such counsel no such action is necessary to maintain such lien. (b) Until the Release Date, the Company shall authorize, execute and deliver such supplemental indenture or indentures and such further instruments and do such further acts as may be necessary or proper to carry out the purposes of this Indenture and to make subject to the lien hereof any property hereafter acquired, made or constructed and intended to be subject to the lien hereof, and to transfer to any new trustee or trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees, the estate, powers, instruments or funds held in trust hereunder. (c) The Company hereby authorizes, until the Release Date, the recordation and filing by the Trustee of one or more financing statements and amendments thereto or any continuation statements with respect thereto to perfect the Trustee's security interest in any portion of the Mortgaged Property. SECTION 7.09. WAIVER OF CERTAIN COVENANTS. The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in (a) any covenant or restriction specified with respect to the Bonds of any one or more series, or any one or more Tranches thereof, as contemplated by Section 3.01 if before the time for such compliance the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series and Tranches with respect to which compliance with such covenant or restriction is to be omitted, considered as one class, shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition; provided, however, that no such waiver shall be effective as to any of the matters contemplated in clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) in Section 14.02 without the consent of the Holders specified in such Section; and (b) Section 7.04, 7.05, 7.06, 7.07 or 7.11 or Article XIII if, before the time for such compliance, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Bonds Outstanding under this Indenture shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition; but, in either case, no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. -66-
SECTION 7.10. ANNUAL OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE AS TO COMPLIANCE. Not later than June 1 in each year, commencing June 1, 2005, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate (which need not comply with Section 1.04) executed by the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer of the Company, as to such officer's knowledge of the Company's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture, such compliance to be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice under this Indenture. SECTION 7.11. LIMITATION ON LIENS. (a) From and after the Release Date, the Company will not, nor will it permit any Significant Subsidiary to, (1) issue, incur, assume or permit to exist any Debt, if such Debt is secured by a Lien on any Principal Property (whether such Principal Property is now owned or hereafter acquired), unless the Company provides that Outstanding Bonds will be equally and ratably secured with such secured Debt or (2) incur or permit to exist any Attributable Debt in respect of Principal Property; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to: (i) to the extent the Company or any Significant Subsidiary consolidates with, or merges with or into, another entity, Liens on the property of such entity securing Debt in existence on the date of such consolidation or merger, provided that such Debt and Liens were not created or incurred in anticipation of such consolidation or merger and that such Liens do not extend to cover any Principal Property; (ii) Liens existing on property hereafter acquired at the time of such acquisition, as long as the Lien was not created or incurred in anticipation thereof and does not extend to or cover any other Principal Property; (iii) Liens of any kind, including purchase money Liens, conditional sales agreements or title retention agreements and similar agreements, upon any property acquired, constructed, developed or improved by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (whether alone or in association with others) which do not exceed the cost or value of the property acquired, constructed, developed or improved and which are created prior to, at the time of, or within 12 months after such acquisition (or in the case of property constructed, developed or improved, within 12 months after the completion of such construction, development or improvement and commencement of full commercial operation of such property, whichever is later) to secure or provide for the payment of any part of the purchase price or cost thereof; provided that the Liens shall not extend to any Principal Property other than the property so acquired, constructed, developed or improved; (iv) Liens in favor of the United States, any state or any foreign country or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of any such jurisdiction to secure payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any indebtedness incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of constructing or improving the property subject to such Lien, including Liens related to governmental obligations the interest on which is tax-exempt under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor section of the Internal Revenue Code; -67-
(v) Liens in favor of the Company, one or more Significant Subsidiaries of the Company, one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the foregoing combination; and (vi) replacements, extensions or renewals (or successive replacements, extensions or renewals), in whole or in part, of any Lien, or of any agreement, referred to above in clauses (i) through (v) inclusive, or replacements, extensions or renewals of the Debt secured thereby (to the extent that the amount of Debt secured by any such Lien is not increased from the amount originally so secured, plus any premium, interest, fee or expenses payable in connection with any replacements, refundings, refinancings, remarketings, extensions or renewals); provided that such replacement, extension or renewal is limited to all or a part of the same property (plus improvements thereon or additions or accessions thereto) that secured the Lien replaced, extended or renewed. (b) Notwithstanding the restriction in subsection (a) of this Section 7.11, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary may, from and after the Release Date, (1) issue, incur or assume Debt secured by a Lien not described in clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (a) above on any Principal Property now or hereafter owned without providing that the Outstanding Bonds be equally and ratably secured with such Debt and (2) issue or permit to exist Attributable Debt in respect of Principal Property, in either case so long as the aggregate amount of such secured Debt and Attributable Debt, together with the aggregate amount of all other Debt secured by Liens not described in clauses (i) through (vi) of subsection (a) above then outstanding and all other Attributable Debt, does not exceed 10% of the Net Tangible Assets of the Company, as determined by the Company as of a month end not more than 90 days prior to the closing or consummation of the proposed transaction. (c) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 7.11, in the event that any Lien at any time meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (i) through (vi) above of Section 7.11(a), or is entitled to be created pursuant to Section 7.11(b), the Company will be permitted to classify (and later reclassify) in whole or in part in its sole discretion such Lien in any manner that complies with this Section 7.11. (d) For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Debt secured by Liens on Principal Property, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Debt denominated in a foreign currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Debt was incurred, in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided that if such Debt is incurred to refinance other Debt denominated in the same foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, the Dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of the Debt being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.11, the maximum amount of Debt secured by Liens on Principal Property that the Company or any Significant Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant will not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. -68-
(e) For purposes of this Section 7.11, "Debt" of a Significant Subsidiary shall mean any debt of such Significant Subsidiary for money borrowed and guarantees by such Significant Subsidiary of debt for money borrowed but in each case excluding liabilities in respect of Capital Lease Obligations or Swap Agreements. SECTION 7.12. COVENANTS REGARDING DIABLO CANYON LEASE. So long as the Diablo Canyon Lease constitutes Mortgaged Property, the Company covenants and agrees that it will not: (i) voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, assign, transfer or convey the leasehold estate created by the Diablo Canyon Lease, (ii) surrender, terminate or cancel the Diablo Canyon Lease, (iii) consent to the subordination of the Diablo Canyon Lease to any monetary lien on the fee estate of the lessor under the Diablo Canyon Lease, (iv) without the prior written consent of the Trustee, fail to exercise in a timely manner any renewal options contained in the Diablo Canyon Lease and (v) without the prior written consent of the Trustee, modify, alter or amend the Diablo Canyon Lease in a manner that has a material adverse effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as a whole. ARTICLE VIII POSSESSION, USE AND RELEASE OF MORTGAGED PROPERTY SECTION 8.01. QUIET ENJOYMENT. Unless one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall be permitted to possess, use, manage, operate and enjoy the Mortgaged Property (except, to the extent not herein otherwise provided, such money, deposit accounts, instruments, investment property and other property as are expressly required by this Indenture to be paid or delivered to, deposited with, or held by, the Trustee hereunder) freely and without any hindrance or interference on the part of the Trustee or of the Holders of the Bonds. SECTION 8.02. DISPOSITIONS WITHOUT RELEASE. With respect to any Mortgaged Property or any interest therein, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company may at any time and from time to time, without any release or consent by, or report to, the Trustee: (a) sell or otherwise dispose of, free from the lien of this Indenture, any machinery, equipment, apparatus, towers, transformers, poles, lines, cables, conduits, ducts, conductors, meters, regulators, holders, tanks, retorts, purifiers, odorizers, scrubbers, compressors, valves, pumps, mains, pipes, service pipes, fittings, connections, services, tools, implements, or any other fixtures or personalty, then subject to the lien hereof, which shall have become old, inadequate, obsolete, worn out, unfit, unadapted, unserviceable, undesirable or unnecessary for use in the operations of the Company upon replacing the same by, or substituting for the same, similar or analogous property, or other property performing a similar or analogous function or otherwise obviating the need therefor (provided, that such similar, analogous or other property constitutes Unfunded Property), having a Cost in the aggregate to the Company at least equal to the Cost in the aggregate of the property sold or otherwise disposed of and subject to the lien -69-
hereof, subject to no Liens prior hereto except Permitted Liens and any other Liens to which the property sold or otherwise disposed of was subject; (b) cancel or make changes or alterations in or substitutions for any and all easements, servitudes, rights-of-way and similar rights and/or interests which are subject to the lien hereof; and (c) grant, free from the lien of this Indenture, easements, ground leases or rights-of-way in, upon, over and/or across the property or rights-of-way of the Company for the purpose of roads, pipe lines, transmission lines, distribution lines, communication lines, railways, removal of coal or other minerals or timber, and other like purposes, or for the joint or common use of real property, rights-of-way, facilities and/or equipment; provided, however, that such grant shall not materially impair the use of the property or rights-of-way for the purposes for which such property or rights-of-way are held by the Company. The Trustee shall, from time to time, execute a written instrument with respect to any particular action taken by the Company under this Section in order to confirm, based solely on its receipt of the documents in subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below of this clause (c), that such action does not require any release or consent by, or report to, the Trustee, upon receipt by the Trustee of (i) a Company Order requesting the same, (ii) an Officer's Certificate stating that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and stating further that said action was duly taken by the Company in conformity with this Section, and (iii) an Opinion of Counsel stating that said action was duly taken by the Company in conformity with this Section. SECTION 8.03. RELEASE OF FUNDED PROPERTY. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company may obtain the release of any part of the Mortgaged Property, or any interest therein, which constitutes Funded Property, and the Trustee shall release all its right, title and interest in and to the same from the lien hereof, upon receipt by the Trustee of: (a) a Company Order requesting the release of such property and transmitting therewith a form of instrument to effect such release; (b) an Officer's Certificate stating that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (c) an Expert's Certificate made and dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such Company Order, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule 2: (i) describing the property to be released; (ii) stating the Fair Value, in the judgment of the signers, of the property to be released; (iii) stating the Funded Property Basis of the property to be released; and -70-
(iv) stating that, in the judgment of the signers, such release will not impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof; (d) an Officer's Certificate, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule 3, stating: (i) the amount in cash (the "Cash Deposit Amount"), if any, to be held by the Trustee and constituting Mortgaged Property (and which cash shall then constitute Funded Cash), which Cash Deposit Amount shall be equal to the difference between (A) the Funded Property Basis of the property to be released, less any taxes and expenses incidental to any sale, exchange, dedication or other disposition of the property to be released, and (B) the aggregate amount of the Cash Deposit Credit Items; and (ii) indicating one or more, or any combination, of the following property (collectively, the "Cash Deposit Credit Items"), if any, and the amounts thereof, which together with the Cash Deposit Amount, if any, to be deposited with the Trustee shall form the basis for the release of property requested in the Company Order referred to in clause (a) above of this Section: (A) the aggregate principal amount of any Purchase Money Obligations delivered to the Trustee, to be held by the Trustee and constituting Mortgaged Property, which are secured by Purchase Money Liens upon the property to be released; (B) the Adjusted Property Additions Basis (or, as provided below in this clause (ii)(B), the Property Additions Basis), of any Property Additions which constitute Unfunded Property described in an Expert's Certificate, dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the Company Order requesting such release and complying with clause (ii) and, to the extent applicable, clause (iii) in Section 5.02(b), delivered to the Trustee; provided, however, that for purposes of the above, the Property Additions Basis shall be substituted in lieu of the Adjusted Property Additions Basis if such Property Additions were acquired, made or constructed on or after the ninetieth (90th) day preceding the date of such Company Order; (C) an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds to the authentication and delivery of which the Company shall be entitled under the provisions of Section 5.03, by virtue of compliance with all applicable provisions of Section 5.03 (except as hereinafter in this Section otherwise provided); provided, however, that such release shall operate as a waiver by the Company of the right to the authentication and delivery of such Bonds and, to such extent, no such Bonds may thereafter be authenticated and delivered under Section 5.03; and any Bonds which were the basis of such right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds so waived shall be deemed to have been made the basis of such release of property; and (D) an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate principal amount of any Outstanding Bonds delivered to the Trustee. (e) the Cash Deposit Amount and the Cash Deposit Credit Items stated in such Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee pursuant to clause (d) of this Section, which in the aggregate -71-
shall be at least equal to the Funded Property Basis of the property to be released, less any taxes and expenses incidental to any sale, exchange, dedication or other disposition of the property to be released; (f) if the release is on the basis of Property Additions or on the basis of the right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds under Section 5.03, all documents contemplated below in this Section; and (g) if the release is on the basis of the delivery to the Trustee of Purchase Money Obligations, as described in clause (d)(ii)(A) in this Section, all documents contemplated below in this Section, to the extent required. If and to the extent that the release of property is, in whole or in part, based upon Property Additions (as described in clause (d)(ii)(B) in this Section), the Company shall, subject to the provisions of said clause (d)(ii)(B) and except as hereafter in this paragraph provided, comply with clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 5.02(b) as if such Property Additions were to be made the basis of the authentication and delivery of Bonds equal in principal amount to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the Funded Property Basis of that portion of the property to be released, as shown by the Expert's Certificate required by clause (c) in this Section, but recognizing that the action to be taken is the release of property rather than the authentication and delivery of Bonds; provided, however, that the Cost of any Property Additions received or to be received by the Company in whole or in part as consideration in exchange for the property to be released shall, for all purposes of this Indenture, be deemed to be the Fair Value of the property to be released as stated in the Expert's Certificate provided for in clause (c) of this Section, (x) plus the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other consideration, further to be stated in such Expert's Certificate, paid and/or delivered or to be paid and/or delivered by, and the amount of any obligations assumed or to be assumed by, the Company in connection with such exchange as additional consideration for such Property Additions and/or (y) less the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any other consideration, which shall also be stated in such Expert's Certificate, received or to be received by the Company in connection with such exchange in addition to such Property Additions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to deliver the documents specified in Section 5.01. Any Property Additions which have become the basis for the release of Funded Property pursuant to this Section shall constitute Funded Property. If and to the extent that the release of property is, in whole or in part, based upon the right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds under Section 5.03 (as described in clause (d)(ii)(C) of this Section), the Company shall, except as hereafter in this paragraph provided, comply with Section 5.03(b) relating to such authentication and delivery, but recognizing that the action to be taken is the release of property rather than the authentication and delivery of Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, in no event shall the Company be required to deliver the documents specified in Section 5.01. If the release of property is, in whole or in part, based upon the delivery to the Trustee of Purchase Money Obligations (as described in clause (d)(ii)(A) of this Section), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee: -72-
(a) an Officer's Certificate (i) stating that no event has occurred and is continuing which entitles the holder of the Purchase Money Lien securing such Purchase Money Obligations to accelerate the maturity of the Purchase Money Obligations, if any, outstanding thereunder, (ii) reciting the aggregate principal amount of Purchase Money Obligations, if any, then outstanding thereunder in addition to the Purchase Money Obligations then being delivered in connection with the release of such property and the terms and conditions, if any, on which additional Purchase Money Obligations are permitted to be issued; and (b) an Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of the signer, (i) such Purchase Money Obligations are valid obligations, (ii) such Purchase Money Lien constitutes, or, upon the taking of the actions specified in such opinion, will constitute, a Lien upon the property to be released, subject, to the knowledge of such counsel, to no Lien prior thereto except Liens generally of the character of Permitted Liens and such Liens, if any, as shall have existed thereon immediately prior to such release as Liens prior to the lien of this Indenture, (iii) if any Purchase Money Obligations in addition to the Purchase Money Obligations being delivered in connection with such release of property are then outstanding, or are permitted to be issued, under such Purchase Money Lien, (A) that such Purchase Money Lien constitutes, or, upon the taking of the actions specified in such opinion, will constitute, a Lien upon all other property, if any, purporting to be subject thereto, subject, to the knowledge of such counsel, to no Lien prior thereto except Liens generally of the character of Permitted Liens and Liens permitted to exist or to be hereafter created under Section 7.06 and (B) that the terms of such Purchase Money Lien, as then in effect, do not permit the issuance of Purchase Money Obligations thereunder except on the basis of property generally of the character of Property Additions, the retirement or deposit of outstanding Purchase Money Obligations, the deposit of prior Lien obligations or the deposit of cash. If the Opinion of Counsel provided to the Trustee pursuant to clause (b) above is conditioned upon the filing and/or recording of any instruments of conveyance, assignment or transfer, the Company shall promptly cause such instruments to be filed and/or recorded in the proper places and manner and shall deliver to the Trustee evidence of such filing and/or recording promptly upon receipt of such evidence by the Company. Any Outstanding Bonds delivered to the Trustee pursuant to clause (d)(ii)(D) of this Section shall forthwith be canceled by the Trustee. Any cash and/or Purchase Money Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (d)(ii)(A) of this Section, and the proceeds of any such Purchase Money Obligations, shall be held by the Trustee and constitute Mortgaged Property and shall be withdrawn, released, used or applied in the manner, to the extent and for the purposes, and subject to the conditions, provided in Section 8.07. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if property to be released constitutes Funded Property in part only, the Company shall obtain the release of the part of such property which constitutes Funded Property under this Section and obtain the release of the part of such property which constitutes Unfunded Property under Section 8.04; provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude the release of such property under any other applicable Section of this Article VIII. In such event, (i) the application of Property Additions in the release under clause (d)(ii)(B) of this Section shall be taken into account in clause (vi) or clause (vii), whichever may be applicable, of the Expert's Certificate described in clause (c) in Section 8.04 -73-
and (ii) the Trustee shall, at the election of the Company, execute and deliver a separate instrument of release with respect to the property released under each of such Sections or a consolidated instrument of release with respect to the property released under both of such Sections considered as a whole. To the extent that only a portion of any Funded Property is to be released under this Section 8.03, the Company shall be entitled to make an allocation of the Funded Property Basis between that portion of the Funded Property being released and that portion of the Funded Property remaining subject to the lien of this Indenture on any reasonable basis as may be determined by the Company. SECTION 8.04. RELEASE OF PROPERTY CONSTITUTING UNFUNDED PROPERTY. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company may obtain the release of any part of the Mortgaged Property, or any interest therein, which constitutes Unfunded Property, and the Trustee shall release all its right, title and interest in and to the same from the lien hereof, upon receipt by the Trustee of: (a) a Company Order requesting the release of such property and transmitting therewith a form of instrument to effect such release; (b) an Officer's Certificate stating that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (c) an Expert's Certificate, made and dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such Company Order, substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule 4: (i) describing the property to be released; (ii) stating (A) the Fair Value, in the judgment of the signers, of the property to be released, (B) to the extent such property to be released is subject to a Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations, the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Lien Obligations as of the date of such certificate, and (C) the Net Fair Value of the property to be released; (iii) stating the Cost and Net Cost of the property to be released; (iv) stating the Property Additions Basis of the property to be released; (v) stating that the property to be released constitutes Unfunded Property; (vi) if true, stating (I) that the aggregate Adjusted Property Additions Basis of all Property Additions which constitute Unfunded Property (excluding the property to be released), is not less than zero (0), or (II) that the Adjusted Property Additions Basis of the property to be released does not exceed the aggregate Adjusted Property Additions Basis of all Property Additions acquired, made or constructed on or after the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date of the Company Order requesting such release; (vii) if neither of the statements contemplated in subclause (vi) above cannot be made, stating (A) the amount by which zero (0) exceeds the amount referred to in subclause (vi)(I) above (showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof) (such amount being -74-
referred to in this Section as the "Make-up Amount") and (B) the amount in cash, if any, to be deposited by the Company, held by the Trustee, and constitute Mortgaged Property, calculated as described in clause (d) below of this Section; and (viii) stating that, in the judgment of the signers, such release will not impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof; (d) if the Expert's Certificate required by clause (c) above does not contain the statement contemplated in clause (c)(vi) above, an amount in cash equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the lower of (i) the Property Additions Basis of the property to be released and (ii) the Make-up Amount, less the aggregate of items of the character described in clauses (d)(ii)(C) and (d)(ii)(D) of Section 8.03 then to be used as a credit against cash required to be deposited under this clause (d) (subject, however, to the same limitations and conditions with respect to such items as are set forth in Section 8.03); and (e) items of the character described in clause (d) above in this Section, if any, being used by the Company as a credit against cash required to be deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (d) above in this Section. SECTION 8.05. RELEASE OF PROPERTIES WITHIN ANNUAL LIMITS. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.03 and 8.04, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company may obtain the release from the lien hereof of any part of the Mortgaged Property, or any interest therein, and the Trustee shall whenever from time to time requested by the Company in a Company Order transmitting therewith a form of instrument to effect such release, and without requiring compliance with any of the provisions of Section 8.03 or 8.04, release from the lien hereof all the right, title and interest of the Trustee in and to the same, provided that the aggregate Fair Value of the property to be so released on any date in a given calendar year, together with the Fair Value of all other property released pursuant to this Section 8.05(a) in such calendar year, shall not exceed the greater of (i) Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) for calendar year 2004; provided, that with respect to any subsequent calendar year, such amount shall be increased by the same percentage increase in the CPI Index for the period commencing January 1, 2004 and ending on January 1 of the applicable calendar year as set forth in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (ii) three percent (3%) of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding. (b) Prior to the granting of any release under this Section, there shall be delivered to the Trustee: (i) an Officer's Certificate stating that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (ii) an Expert's Certificate stating (A) in the judgment of the signers, the Fair Value of the property to be released and the aggregate Fair Value of all other property theretofore released pursuant to this Section in such calendar year, (B) as to Funded Property, the Funded Property Basis thereof, and (C) that, in the judgment of the signers, the release thereof will not impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof. -75-
(c) On or before December 31st of each calendar year, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount in cash equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the aggregate Funded Property Basis of the properties constituting Funded Property so released during such year (the "Cash Deposit Amount") and such Cash Deposit Amount shall constitute Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that the Cash Deposit Amount may be reduced, at the election of the Company, by any of, or any combination of, the Cash Deposit Credit Items specified in clause (d)(ii) of Section 8.03, subject to all of the limitations and conditions specified in such Section, to the same extent as if such property were being released pursuant to Section 8.03. Any cash deposited with the Trustee under this Section may thereafter be withdrawn, used or applied in the manner, to the extent and for the purposes, and subject to the conditions, provided in Section 8.07. SECTION 8.06. PURCHASE MONEY OBLIGATIONS. (a) Any Purchase Money Obligations delivered to the Trustee in consideration of the release of property from the lien of this Indenture, together with any evidence of the applicable Purchase Money Lien held by the Trustee, shall be released from the lien of this Indenture and delivered to or upon the order of the Company upon payment by the Company to the Trustee of an amount in cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Purchase Money Obligations less the aggregate amount theretofore paid to the Trustee (by the Company, the obligor or otherwise) in respect of the principal of such Purchase Money Obligations, such cash to constitute Mortgaged Property. (b) The principal of and interest on any such Purchase Money Obligations secured by a Purchase Money Lien held by the Trustee shall be held by the Trustee as and when the same are received by the Trustee and shall constitute Mortgaged Property. The interest received by the Trustee on any such Purchase Money Obligations shall be deemed not to constitute Funded Cash and shall be remitted to the Company free and clear of any Lien; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such proceeds shall constitute Mortgaged Property and shall be retained by the Trustee until such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. (c) The Trustee shall have and may exercise all the rights and powers of any owner of such Purchase Money Obligations and of all substitutions therefor and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may collect and receive all insurance moneys payable to it under any of the provisions thereof and apply the same in accordance with the provisions thereof, may consent to extensions thereof at a higher or lower rate of interest, may join in any plan or plans of voluntary or involuntary reorganization or readjustment or rearrangement and may accept and hold hereunder new obligations, stocks or other securities issued in exchange therefor under any such plan. Any discretionary action which the Trustee may be entitled to take in connection with any such Purchase Money Obligations or substitutions therefor shall be taken, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in accordance with a Company Order, and, during the continuance of an Event of Default, in its own discretion. (d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may irrevocably waive all right to the withdrawal pursuant to this Section of, and any other rights with respect to, -76-
any Purchase Money Obligations held by the Trustee, and the proceeds of any such Purchase Money Obligations, by delivery to the Trustee of a Company Order: (i) specifying such Purchase Money Obligations and stating that the Company thereby waives all rights to the withdrawal thereof and of the proceeds thereof pursuant to this Section, and any other rights with respect thereto; and (ii) directing that the principal of such Purchase Money Obligations be applied as provided in clause (e) of Section 8.07, specifying the Bonds to be paid or redeemed or for the payment or redemption of which payment is to be made. Following any such waiver, the interest on any such Purchase Money Obligations shall be applied to the payment of interest, if any, on the Bonds to be paid or redeemed or for the payment or redemption of which provision is to be made, as specified in the aforesaid Company Order, as and when such interest shall become due from time to time, and any excess funds remaining from time to time after such application shall be applied to the payment of interest on any other Bonds as and when the same shall become due. Pending any such application, the interest on such Purchase Money Obligations shall be invested in Investment Securities specified in a Company Order. The principal of any such Purchase Money Obligations shall be applied solely to the payment of principal of the Bonds to be paid or redeemed or for the payment or redemption of which provision is to be made, as specified in the aforesaid Company Order. Pending such application, the principal of such Purchase Money Obligations shall be invested in Eligible Obligations specified in a Company Order. The obligation of the Company to pay the principal of such Bonds when the same shall become due at Maturity, shall be offset and reduced by the amount of the proceeds of such Purchase Money Obligations then held, and to be applied, by the Trustee in accordance with this paragraph. SECTION 8.07. WITHDRAWAL OR OTHER APPLICATION OF FUNDED CASH. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.04 with respect to Deposited Cash and except as hereafter in this Section provided, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Funded Cash held by the Trustee, and any other cash which is required to be withdrawn, used or applied as provided in this Section, (a) may be withdrawn from time to time by the Company free and clear of any Lien to the extent of the Adjusted Property Additions Basis (or, as provided below in this clause (a), the Property Additions Basis) of Property Additions constituting Unfunded Property, described in an Expert's Certificate, dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of the Company Order requesting such withdrawal and complying with clause (ii) and, to the extent applicable, clause (iii) in Section 5.02(b), delivered to the Trustee; provided, however, that, for purposes of the above, the Property Additions Basis shall be substituted in lieu of the Adjusted Property Additions Basis if such Property Additions were acquired, made or constructed on or after the ninetieth (90th) day preceding the date of such Company Order; (b) may be withdrawn from time to time by the Company free and clear of any Lien in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds to the authentication and delivery of which the Company shall be entitled under the provisions of -77-
Section 5.03 hereof, by virtue of compliance with all applicable provisions of Section 5.03 (except as hereinafter in this Section otherwise provided); provided, however, that such withdrawal of cash shall operate as a waiver by the Company of the right to the authentication and delivery of such Bonds and, to such extent, no such Bonds may thereafter be authenticated and delivered hereunder; and any such Bonds which were the basis of such right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds so waived shall be deemed to have been made the basis of such withdrawal of cash; (c) may be withdrawn from time to time by the Company free and clear of any Lien in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the aggregate principal amount of any Outstanding Bonds delivered to the Trustee; (d) may, upon delivery of a Company Request to the Trustee, be used by the Trustee for the purchase of Bonds in the manner, at the time or times, in the amount or amounts, at the price or prices (not exceeding one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the principal amount thereof) and otherwise as directed or approved by the Company, all subject to the limitations hereafter in this Section set forth; or (e) may, upon delivery of a Company Request to the Trustee, be applied by the Trustee to the payment (or provision therefor pursuant to Article IX) at Stated Maturity of any Bonds or to the redemption (or similar provision therefor) of any Bonds which are, by their terms, redeemable, in each case of such series as may be designated by the Company, any such redemption to be in the manner and as provided in Article VI, all subject to the limitations hereafter in this Section set forth. Such moneys shall, from time to time, be paid or used or applied by the Trustee, as aforesaid, upon the request of the Company in a Company Order, and upon receipt by the Trustee of an Officer's Certificate stating that, to the knowledge of the signer, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. If and to the extent that the withdrawal of cash is based upon Property Additions (as permitted under the provisions of clause (a) above), the Company shall, subject to the provisions of said clause (a) and except as hereafter in this paragraph provided, comply with clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 5.02(b) as if such Property Additions were made the basis for the authentication and delivery of Bonds equal in principal amount to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the cash so to be withdrawn, but recognizing that the action to be taken is the release of Funded Cash rather than the authentication and delivery of Bonds. Any Property Additions which have become the basis for the withdrawal of cash pursuant to this Section shall constitute Funded Property. If and to the extent that the withdrawal of cash is based upon the right to the authentication and delivery of Bonds (as permitted under the provisions of clause (b) above), the Company shall, except as hereafter in this paragraph provided, comply with Section 5.03(b) relating to such authentication and delivery, but recognizing that the action to be taken is the release of Funded Cash rather than the authentication and delivery of Bonds. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, in no event shall the Company be required to deliver the documents specified in Section 5.01. Notwithstanding the generality of clauses (d) and (e) above, no cash to be applied pursuant to such clauses shall be applied to the payment of an amount in excess of the principal -78-
amount of any Bonds to be purchased, paid or redeemed except to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of all Bonds theretofore, and of all Bonds then to be, purchased, paid or redeemed pursuant to such clauses is not less than the aggregate cost for principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on and brokerage commissions, if any, with respect to, such Bonds. Any Outstanding Bonds delivered to the Trustee pursuant to clause (c) in this Section shall forthwith be canceled by the Trustee. SECTION 8.08. RELEASE OF PROPERTY TAKEN BY EMINENT DOMAIN, ETC. Should any of the Mortgaged Property, or any interest therein, be taken by exercise of the power of eminent domain or be sold to an entity possessing the power of eminent domain under a threat to exercise the same, and should the Company elect not to obtain the release of such property pursuant to other provisions of this Article, the Trustee shall, upon request of the Company evidenced by a Company Order transmitting therewith a form of instrument to effect such release, release from the lien hereof all its right, title and interest in and to the property so taken or sold (or with respect to an interest in property, subordinate the lien hereof to such interest), upon receiving (a) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such property has been taken by exercise of the power of eminent domain or has been sold to an entity possessing the power of eminent domain under threat of an exercise of such power, (b) an Officer's Certificate stating the amount of net proceeds received or to be received for such property so taken or sold, and the amount so stated shall be deemed to be the Fair Value of such property for the purpose of any notice to the Holders of Bonds, (c) if any portion of such property constitutes Funded Property, an Expert's Certificate stating the Funded Property Basis thereof and (d) if any portion of such property constitutes Funded Property, a deposit by the Company of an amount in cash equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Funded Property Basis stated in the Expert's Certificate delivered pursuant to clause (c) above, such deposit to constitute Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that the amount required to be so deposited shall not exceed the portion of the net proceeds received or to be received for such property so taken or sold which is allocable on a pro-rata or other reasonable basis to the portion of such property constituting Funded Property; and provided, further, that the net proceeds of such taking or sale required to be deposited pursuant to this Section shall be reduced by the amount of cash or other consideration that has been delivered to or otherwise deposited with a holder of a Senior Lien securing Senior Lien Obligations in accordance with the provisions of such Senior Lien, all as stated in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee (which shall also state that such cash or consideration has not previously been applied by the Company as a credit against any other deposit of cash required to be made by the Company under this Indenture). Any cash deposited with the Trustee under this Section may thereafter be withdrawn, used or applied in the manner, to the extent and for the purposes, and subject to the conditions, provided in Section 8.07. SECTION 8.09. DISCLAIMER OR QUITCLAIM. In case the Company has sold, exchanged, dedicated, pledged, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or has agreed or intends to sell, exchange, dedicate, pledge, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or a Governmental Authority has ordered the Company to divest itself of, any Excepted Property or any other property not subject to the lien hereof, or the -79-
Company desires to disclaim or quitclaim title to property to which the Company does not purport to have title, the Trustee shall, from time to time, disclaim or quitclaim such property and any interest it may have therein upon receipt by the Trustee of the following: (a) a Company Order requesting such disclaimer or quitclaim and transmitting therewith a form of instrument to effect such disclaimer or quitclaim; (b) an Officer's Certificate describing the property to be disclaimed or quitclaimed; and (c) an Opinion of Counsel stating the signer's opinion that such property does not constitute Mortgaged Property. SECTION 8.10. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) If the Fair Value of the property to be released from the lien of this Indenture in accordance with any provision of this Article, other than Section 8.12, plus the Fair Value of all other property released since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates required by this Indenture, is ten percent (10%) or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, an Independent Expert shall be required to make the certifications in the Expert's Certificate required pursuant to this Article as to the Fair Value of the property to be released and as to the nonimpairment of the security under this Indenture. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, an Expert's Certificate shall not be required to be made by an Independent Expert in the case of any release of property if the Fair Value of such property to be released, as set forth in the certificates required by this Indenture, is a De Minimis Amount. To the extent that the Fair Value of any property to be released from the lien of this Indenture shall be stated in an Independent Expert's Certificate, such Fair Value shall not be required to be stated in any other Expert's Certificate delivered in connection with such release. (b) No release of property from the lien of this Indenture effected in accordance with the provisions, and in compliance with the conditions, set forth in this Article and in Sections 1.04 and 1.05 shall be deemed to impair the security of this Indenture in contravention of any provision hereof. (c) If the Mortgaged Property shall be in the possession of a receiver or trustee, lawfully appointed, the powers hereinbefore conferred upon the Company with respect to the release of any part of the Mortgaged Property or any interest therein or the withdrawal of cash may be exercised, with the approval of the Trustee, by such receiver or trustee, notwithstanding that an Event of Default may have occurred and be continuing, and any request, certificate, appointment or approval made or signed by such receiver or trustee for such purposes shall be as effective as if made by the Company or any of its officers or appointees in the manner herein provided; and if the Trustee shall be in possession of the Mortgaged Property under any provision of this Indenture, then such powers may be exercised by the Trustee in its discretion notwithstanding that an Event of Default may have occurred and be continuing. (d) If the Company shall retain any interest in any property released from the lien of this Indenture as provided in Section 8.03, 8.04 or 8.05, this Indenture shall not become or be, or be required to become or be, a Lien upon such property or such interest therein or any improvements, extensions or additions to such property or renewals, replacements or -80-
substitutions of or for such property or any part or parts thereof or any proceeds of any of the foregoing unless the Company shall execute and deliver to the Trustee an indenture supplemental hereto, in recordable form, containing a grant, conveyance, transfer and mortgage thereof. As used in this subsection, the terms "improvements", "extensions" and "additions" shall be limited as set forth in Section 13.01. (e) Notwithstanding the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee, in its discretion, may release from the lien hereof any part of the Mortgaged Property or permit the withdrawal of cash, upon compliance with the other conditions specified in this Article in respect thereof. (f) No purchaser or grantee of property purporting to have been released hereunder shall be bound to ascertain the authority of the Trustee to execute the release, or to inquire as to any facts required by the provisions hereof for the exercise of such authority; nor shall any purchaser or grantee of any property or rights permitted by this Article to be sold, granted, exchanged, dedicated or otherwise disposed of, be under obligation to ascertain or inquire into the authority of the Company to make any such sale, grant, exchange, dedication or other disposition. SECTION 8.11. PRIORITY OF PURCHASE MONEY LIENS. The Trustee hereby acknowledges and agrees to subordinate the lien of this Indenture to any Purchase Money Lien or conservation easement upon receipt by the Trustee of (i) a Company Request for any such subordination which includes a description of the Purchase Money Lien or the conservation easement to which this Indenture is being subordinated, (ii) an Officer's Certificate stating that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing to the knowledge of the signer, that the mortgage or other instrument or agreement with respect to which a subordination is being requested is a Purchase Money Lien or conservation easement and stating that such Purchase Money Lien or conservation easement does not encumber any Funded Property, and (iii) a form of instrument appropriate and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to effect such subordination. Upon receipt of the foregoing, the Trustee hereby agrees to promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver the instrument described in clause (iii) above or any other instrument that the Company may request in order to evidence or effect the subordination as requested by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall not unless otherwise permitted under the terms of this Indenture, subordinate the lien of this Indenture to any Purchase Money Lien or conservation easement which encumbers Funded Property. SECTION 8.12. RELEASE DATE. The date upon which the lien of this Indenture shall be discharged, canceled, terminated and satisfied and the Mortgaged Property shall be released to the Company free and clear of any Lien (the "Release Date") shall be the date chosen by the Company and specified in a Company Order delivered to the Trustee, which date shall not be earlier than the date of delivery by the Company to the Trustee of each of the following: (a) Written evidence that the Unsecured Debt Ratings, immediately after the Release Date, shall be at least equal to the Issuance Date Secured Debt Ratings; -81-

Upon the occurrence of the Release Date, the Trustee shall promptly (i) authorize, execute and deliver to the order of the Company the documents and instruments necessary to discharge, cancel, terminate and satisfy the lien of this Indenture, (ii) release, quitclaim and otherwise turn over to the Company all Mortgaged Property (other than money and Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.03), and (iii) execute and deliver to the Company such deeds, termination statements and other documents and instruments as, in the judgment of the Company, shall be necessary, desirable or appropriate to effect or evidence such release, quitclaim and turnover. Upon the occurrence of the Release Date and notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or the Bonds, all Bonds, automatically and without any further action by the Company, the Trustee, or any Holder, shall no longer be secured by any collateral and shall constitute unsecured obligations of the Company, all references in this Indenture to the lien of the Indenture or the Mortgaged Property shall be of no further force or effect, and the provisions of this Indenture and the Bonds shall be construed consistently with the status of the Bonds as unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the occurrence of the Release Date, give notice to all Holders of the occurrence of the Release Date in the same manner as a notice of redemption and disseminate a press release through a public medium as is customary for such a press release announcing that the lien of the Indenture has been released as of the Release Date. ARTICLE IX SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 9.01. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF BONDS. Any Bond or Bonds, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, shall be deemed to have been paid and no longer Outstanding for all purposes of this Indenture, and the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall be satisfied and discharged, if there shall have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust: -82-
(a) money (including Funded Cash not otherwise applied pursuant to Section 8.07) in an amount which shall be sufficient, or (b) in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Bonds or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Bonds or portions thereof; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for payment or redemption of less than all the Bonds of any series or Tranche, such Bonds or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Bond Registrar as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent: (x) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Bonds, a Company Order stating that the money and Eligible Obligations deposited in accordance with this Section shall be held in trust, as provided in Section 9.03; (y) if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such obligations constitute Eligible Obligations and do not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, and an opinion of an Independent public Accountant of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the other requirements set forth in clause (b) above have been satisfied; and (z) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Bonds, an Officer's Certificate stating the Company's intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Bonds or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. Upon the deposit of money or Eligible Obligations, or both, in accordance with this Section, together with the documents required by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, the Trustee shall, upon Company Request, acknowledge in writing that such Bonds or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture and that the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof has been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Bonds or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officer's Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Bonds or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Bonds or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefit of the lien of this Indenture (other than with respect to such deposit, which -83-
shall constitute Mortgaged Property) or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article VII (except the covenants contained in Sections 7.02 and 7.03) or any other covenants made in respect of such Bonds or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01, but the indebtedness of the Company in respect of such Bonds or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such Bonds or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture. If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Bond Registrar shall select such Bonds, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 6.03 for selection for redemption of less than all the Bonds of a series or Tranche. In the event that Bonds which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Company's indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section, do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the sixty (60) day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Bonds, to the Holders of such Bonds to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof. Notwithstanding that any Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Bonds under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 6.04, 7.02, 7.03, 11.07 and 11.15 and this Article shall survive. The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Bond would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, such Bond shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Bond shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect of any Bond shall be subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 7.03. -84-
SECTION 9.02. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as hereinafter expressly provided), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute such instruments as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when: (a) no Bonds remain Outstanding hereunder; (b) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 9.01, any Bond, previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 6.04, 7.02, 7.03, 11.07 and 11.15 and this Article shall survive. Upon satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as provided in this Section, the Trustee shall, to the extent not already done so pursuant to Section 8.12, release, quit claim and otherwise turn over to the Company the Mortgaged Property (other than money and Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to Section 9.03) and shall execute and deliver to the Company such deeds and other instruments as, in the judgment of the Company, shall be necessary, desirable or appropriate to effect or evidence such release and quitclaim and the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. SECTION 9.03. APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY. Neither the Eligible Obligations nor the money deposited pursuant to Section 9.01, nor the principal or interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations, shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Bonds or portions of principal amount thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject, however, to the provisions of Section 7.03; provided, however, that any cash received from such principal or interest payments on such Eligible Obligations, if not then needed for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon Company Request and delivery to the Trustee of the documents referred to in subclause (y) of clause (c) in Section 9.01, be invested pursuant to a Company Order in Eligible Obligations of the type described in clause (b) in Section 9.01 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient, together with any other moneys and the proceeds of any other Eligible -85-
Obligations then held by the Trustee, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Bonds or portions thereof on and prior to the Maturity thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestment shall be paid over to the Company as received, free and clear of the lien of this Indenture, except the lien provided by Section 11.07; and provided, further, that any moneys held in accordance with this Section on the Maturity of all such Bonds in excess of the amount required to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due on such Bonds shall be paid over to the Company free and clear of the lien of this Indenture, except the lien provided by Section 11.07; and provided, further, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, moneys to be paid over to the Company pursuant to this Section shall be retained by the Trustee and constitute Mortgaged Property until such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.

"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to the Bonds, means any of the following events which shall have occurred and be continuing: (a) the failure to pay interest, if any, on any Bond within thirty (30) days after the same becomes due and payable; or (b) the failure to pay the principal of or sinking fund installment, if any, or premium, if any, on any Bond after the same becomes due and payable; or (c) the failure to perform or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of which or breach of which is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with) for a period of ninety (90) days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Company by the Trustee, or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least thirty-three percent (33%) in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, unless the Trustee, or the Trustee and the Holders of a principal amount of Bonds not less than the principal amount of Bonds the Holders of which gave such notice, as the case may be, shall agree in writing to an extension of such period prior to its expiration; or (d) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more Persons other than the Company seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Company or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or -86-
order for relief or any such other decree or order shall have remained unstayed and in effect for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; or (e) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by the Company to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against the Company, or the filing by the Company of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or the consent by the Company to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by the Company of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or an admission in writing by the Company of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; or (f) the occurrence of any event of default as defined in any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any Debt of the Company, whether such Debt exists on the Execution Date or shall thereafter be created, if such event of default: (i) is caused by a failure to pay principal after final maturity of such Debt after the expiration of the grace period provided in such Debt (a "Payment Default"), or (ii) results in the acceleration of such Debt prior to its express maturity, and in each case, the principal amount of any such Debt, together with the principal amount of any other such Debt under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $100,000,000 or more; provided, however, that, anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if prior to the Release Date, such event of default is cured or waived or any such acceleration rescinded, or such Debt is repaid, within a period of twenty (20) days from the continuation of such event of default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default under this Indenture shall be automatically cured; provided, further, that with respect to any mortgage, indenture or instrument that exists on the Execution Date, this Section 10.01(f) only applies to the extent that the obligations to pay amounts thereunder are enforceable after the Effective Date. For purposes of Section 10.01(f), the amount of $100,000,000 shall be increased in any calendar year subsequent to 2004 by the same percentage increase in the CPI Index for the period commencing January 1, 2004 and ending on January 1 of the applicable calendar year. SECTION 10.02. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than a majority prior to the Release Date or 33% on or after the Release Date, in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, considered as one class, -87-
may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Bonds are Discount Bonds, such portion of the principal amount of such Bonds as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01) of all Bonds then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount), together with premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, thereon, shall become immediately due and payable; provided, however, that with respect to an Event of Default described in Section 10.01(d) or (e), the principal amount (or, if any of the Bonds are Discount Bonds, such portion of the principal amount of such Bonds as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01) of all Bonds then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without further action by the Trustee or Holders. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have been made, but before any sale of any of the Mortgaged Property has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as provided in this Article, the Event or Events of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 316(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if (a) the Company shall have paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (i) all overdue interest, if any, on all Bonds then Outstanding; (ii) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Bonds then Outstanding which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Bonds; and (iii) all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 11.07; and (b) any other Event or Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of Bonds which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 10.17. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 10.03. ENTRY UPON MORTGAGED PROPERTY. Prior to the Release Date, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company, upon demand of the Trustee and if and to the extent permitted by law, shall forthwith surrender to the Trustee the actual possession of, and the Trustee, by such officers or agents as it may appoint, may enter upon and take possession of, the Mortgaged Property; and the Trustee may hold, operate and manage the Mortgaged Property and make all needful repairs and such renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements as to the Trustee shall seem prudent; and the Trustee may receive the rents, issues, profits, revenues and other income of the Mortgaged Property, to the extent, if any, that the same shall not then constitute Excepted Property; and, after deducting the costs and expenses of entering, taking possession, holding, -88-
operating and managing the Mortgaged Property, as well as payments for insurance and taxes and other proper charges upon the Mortgaged Property prior to the lien of this Indenture and reasonable compensation to itself, its agents and counsel, the Trustee may apply the same as provided in Section 10.07. Whenever all that is then due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Bonds and under any of the terms of this Indenture shall have been paid and all defaults hereunder shall have been cured or shall have been waived as provided in Section 10.17, the Trustee shall surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property to the Company. SECTION 10.04. POWER OF SALE; SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee, by such officers or agents as it shall appoint, with or without entry, in its discretion may, subject to the provisions of Section 10.16 and if and to the extent permitted by law: (a) prior to the Release Date, sell, subject to any mandatory requirements of applicable law, the Mortgaged Property as an entirety, or in such parcels as the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall in writing request, or in the absence of such request, as the Trustee may determine, to the highest bidder at public auction at such place and at such time (which sale may be adjourned by the Trustee from time to time in its discretion by announcement at the time and place fixed for such sale, without further notice) and upon such terms as the Trustee may fix and briefly specify in a notice of sale to be published once in each week for four successive weeks prior to such sale in an Authorized Publication in each Place of Payment for the Bonds of each series; or (b) proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Bonds under this Indenture by sale pursuant to judicial proceedings or by a suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law or otherwise, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the execution of any power granted in this Indenture or for the foreclosure of this Indenture or for the enforcement of any other legal, equitable or other remedy, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights of the Trustee or the Holders of Bonds. SECTION 10.05. INCIDENTS OF SALE. Upon any sale of any of the Mortgaged Property, whether made under the power of sale hereby given or pursuant to judicial proceedings, to the extent permitted by law: (a) the principal amount (or, if any of the Bonds are Discount Bonds, such portion of the principal amount of such Bonds as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01) of all Outstanding Bonds, if not previously due, shall at once become and be immediately due and payable, together with premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, thereon; (b) any Holder or Holders of Bonds or the Trustee may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale, and upon compliance with the terms of sale may hold, retain and possess and dispose of such property, without further accountability, and may, in paying the purchase money therefor, deliver any Outstanding Bonds or claims for interest thereon in lieu of cash to the -89-

SECTION 10.06. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE. If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 10.01 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Bonds with respect to which such Event of Default shall have occurred, the whole amount then due and payable on such Bonds for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 11.07. If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Bonds and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Bonds, wherever situated. -90-

No recovery of any such judgment by the Trustee and no levy of any execution upon any such judgment upon any of the Mortgaged Property or any other property of the Company shall affect or impair the lien of this Indenture upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or any rights, powers or remedies of the Trustee hereunder, or any rights, powers or remedies of the Holders of the Bonds. SECTION 10.07. APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article, including any rents, issues, profits, revenues and other income collected pursuant to Section 10.03 (after the deductions therein provided) and any proceeds of any sale (after deducting the costs and expenses of such sale, including a reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any taxes, assessments or Liens prior to the lien of this Indenture, except any thereof subject to which such sale shall have been made), whether made under any power of sale herein granted or pursuant to judicial proceedings, and any money collected by the Trustee under Section 8.06, together with, in the case of an entry or sale or as otherwise provided herein, any other sums then held by the Trustee as part of the Mortgaged Property, shall be applied in the following order, to the extent permitted by law, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Bonds and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 11.07; Second: To the payment of the whole amount then due and unpaid upon the Outstanding Bonds for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected; and in case such proceeds shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon such Bonds, then to the payment of such principal and interest, if any, thereon without any preference or priority, ratably according to the aggregate amount so due and unpaid, with any balance then remaining to the payment of premium, if any, and, if so specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest, if any, on overdue premium, if any, and overdue interest, if any, ratably as aforesaid, all to the extent permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.06 in respect of interest or pursuant to Section 10.03 shall first be applied to the payment of interest accrued on the principal of Outstanding Bonds; and -91-
Third: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. SECTION 10.08. RECEIVER. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and, during the continuance thereof, the Trustee shall have commenced judicial proceedings to enforce any right under this Indenture, the Trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be entitled, prior to the Release Date, as against the Company, without notice or demand and without regard to the adequacy of the security for the Bonds or the solvency of the Company, to the appointment of a receiver of the Mortgaged Property. SECTION 10.09. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Bonds or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Bonds shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Bonds and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 11.07) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 11.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Bonds or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. SECTION 10.10. TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF BONDS. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or on the Bonds may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be -92-
brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 10.11. LIMITATION ON SUITS. No Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless: (a) such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default; (b) the Holders of at least thirty-three percent (33%) in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (c) such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (d) the Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such proceeding; and (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee during such sixty (60) day period by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien of this Indenture or the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 10.12. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Bond shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 3.07) interest, if any, on such Bond on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Bond (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. -93-
SECTION 10.13. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 10.14. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the availability of the remedies set forth herein (on an individual or cumulative basis) and the procedures set forth herein relating to the exercise thereof shall be subject to (a) the law (including, for purposes of this paragraph, general principles of equity) of any jurisdiction wherein the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof is located to the extent that such law is mandatorily applicable and (b) the rights of any Senior Lienholder and, if and to the extent that any provision of this Article conflicts with any provision of such applicable law and/or with the rights of such Senior Lienholder such provision of law and/or the rights of such holder shall control. SECTION 10.15. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 10.16. CONTROL BY HOLDERS OF BONDS. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee hereunder; provided, however, that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where indemnity would not, in the Trustee's sole discretion, be adequate, and -94-
(b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 10.17. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. Before any sale of any of the Mortgaged Property and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Bonds then Outstanding waive any past default hereunder and its consequences, except a default (a) in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Bond Outstanding, or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Section 14.02 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Bond of any series or Tranche affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any and all Events of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 10.18. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. The Company and the Trustee agree, and each Holder of Bonds by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than ten percent (10%) in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Bond on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Bond (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date). SECTION 10.19. WAIVER OF APPRAISEMENT AND OTHER LAWS. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law, now or hereafter in effect, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this Indenture or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof, or the possession thereof, or any part thereof, by any purchaser at any sale under this Article; and the Company, for itself and all who may claim under it, so far as -95-
it or they now or hereafter may lawfully do so, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws. The Company, for itself and all who may claim under it, waives, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, all right to have the Mortgaged Property marshalled upon any foreclosure of the lien hereof, and agrees that any court having jurisdiction to foreclose the lien of this Indenture may order the sale of the Mortgaged Property as an entirety. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, for itself and all who may claim under it, waives, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, the benefits and protections of Sections 2924, 2924b and 2924c of the California Civil Code and Section 726(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and any amendments thereto or replacements thereof.

(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (b) In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct or its own bad faith, except that: (i) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; -96-

(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. SECTION 11.02. NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. Within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of any default hereunder, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders notice of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Bond, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to a Bond, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, executive committee or a trust committee of directors or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders; provided, further, that, in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 10.01(c), no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least sixty (60) days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default.

In the absence of such actual knowledge or notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume that no such default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Trustee shall not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements herein or of any of the documents executed in connection with Bonds issued hereunder, or as to the existence of a default or Event of Default hereunder.

Each of the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Bond Registrar or any other agent of the Company or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Bonds and, subject to Sections 11.08 and 11.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not such Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Bond Registrar or other agent.

SECTION 11.07. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. The Company agrees (a) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and -99-
the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except to the extent that any such expense, disbursement or advance may be attributable to its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and (c) to indemnify the Trustee (which for purposes of this Section shall include its officers, directors, employees and agents) and hold it harmless from and against any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder or the exercise or performance of its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. Prior to the Release Date, as security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section 11.07, the Trustee shall have a lien secured by this Indenture prior to the Bonds upon the Mortgaged Property and upon all other property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, other than property and funds held in trust (i) for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds or (ii) under Section 9.03 (except moneys payable to the Company as provided in Section 9.03). "Trustee" for purposes of this Section shall include any predecessor Trustee; provided, however, that the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights of any other Trustee hereunder. In addition and without prejudice to the rights provided to the Trustee under any of the provisions of this Indenture, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 10.01(d) or Section 10.01(e), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. SECTION 11.08. DISQUALIFICATION; CONFLICTING INTERESTS. If the Trustee shall have or acquire any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, it shall either eliminate such conflicting interest or resign to the extent, in the manner and with the effect, and subject to the conditions, provided in the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. For purposes of Section 310(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act and to the extent permitted thereby, the Trustee, in its capacity as trustee in respect of the Bonds of any series, shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest arising from its capacity as trustee in respect of the Bonds of any other series. SECTION 11.09. CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be (i) a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws -100-
to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, or (ii) if and to the extent permitted by the Commission by rule, regulation or order upon application, a corporation or other Person organized and doing business under the laws of a foreign government, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) or the Dollar equivalent of the applicable foreign currency and subject to supervision or examination by authority of such foreign government or a political subdivision thereof substantially equivalent to supervision or examination applicable to United States institutional trustees, and, in either case, qualified and eligible under this Article and the Trust Indenture Act. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of such supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 11.10. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 11.11. (b) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 11.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. (d) If at any time: (i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 11.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for at least six months, or (ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 11.09 or Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public -101-
officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (x) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee or (y) subject to Section 10.18, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for at least six (6) months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause (other than as contemplated in clause (y) in subsection (d) of this Section), the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall take prompt steps to appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 11.11. If, within one (1) year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 11.11, become the successor Trustee and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 11.11, the Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Bonds may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. (f) So long as no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee (i) a Board Resolution appointing a successor Trustee, effective as of a date specified therein, and (ii) an instrument of acceptance of such appointment, effective as of such date, by such successor Trustee in accordance with Section 11.11, the Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned as contemplated in subsection (b) of this Section, the successor Trustee shall be deemed to have been appointed pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section and such appointment shall be deemed to have been accepted as contemplated in Section 11.11, all as of such date, and all other provisions of this Section and Section 11.11 shall be applicable to such resignation, appointment and acceptance except to the extent inconsistent with this subsection (f). (g) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders as their names and addresses appear in the Bond Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 11.11. ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, -102-
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee. Such retiring Trustee shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien provided for in Section 11.07. (b) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any instruments which fully vest in and confirm to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts referred to in subsection (a) of this Section. (c) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 11.12. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Bonds shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Bonds so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Bonds. SECTION 11.13. PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY. If the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company or any other obligor upon the Bonds (other than by reason of a relationship described in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act), the Trustee shall be subject to any and all applicable provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company or such other obligor. SECTION 11.14. CO-TRUSTEES AND SEPARATE TRUSTEES. At any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any of the Mortgaged Property may at the time be located, the Company and the Trustee shall have power to appoint, and, upon the written request of the Trustee or of the Holders of at least thirty-three percent (33%) in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, the Company shall for such purpose join with the Trustee in the execution and delivery of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Trustee and, if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, by the Company either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Trustee, of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, or to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If the Company does not join in such appointment within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or if an Event of -103-
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment. Should any written instrument or instruments from the Company be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed to more fully confirm to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Company. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following conditions: (i) the Bonds shall be authenticated and delivered, and all rights, powers, duties and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustee hereunder, shall be exercised solely, by the Trustee; (ii) the rights, powers, duties and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed either by the Trustee or by the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee; (iii) the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the concurrence of the Company, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Company. Upon the written request of the Trustee, the Company shall join with the Trustee in the execution and delivery of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section; (iv) neither the Trustee nor any co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and (v) any Act of Holders delivered to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. SECTION 11.15. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to the Bonds of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Bonds of such series or Tranche issued upon original issuance, exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.06, and Bonds so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory -104-
for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Bonds by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. The provisions of Sections 3.08, 11.04 and 11.05 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent. If an appointment with respect to the Bonds of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Bonds of such series or Tranche may have -105-
endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form: This is one of the Bonds of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. ___________________________, as Trustee By _________________________________________ As Authenticating Agent By _________________________________________ Authorized Officer If all of the Bonds of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Bonds upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Bonds of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 1.04 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint, in accordance with this Section and in accordance with such procedures as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Bonds. ARTICLE XII LISTS OF HOLDERS; REPORTS BY TRUSTEE AND COMPANY SECTION 12.01. LISTS OF HOLDERS. Semiannually, not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days after June 1 and December 1 in each year, commencing 2004, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee, information as to the names and addresses of the Holders as of a date no more than fifteen (15) days prior to the date such information is so furnished, and the Trustee shall preserve such information and similar information received by it in any other capacity and afford to the Holders access to information so preserved by it, all to such extent, if any, and in such manner as shall be required by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that no such list need be furnished so long as the Trustee shall be the Bond Registrar.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). The Company shall notify the Trustee of the listing of any Bonds on any securities exchange. ARTICLE XIII CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE OR OTHER TRANSFER SECTION 13.01. COMPANY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC., ONLY ON CERTAIN TERMS. The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person, or convey, or otherwise transfer, or lease, subject to the lien of this Indenture, all or substantially all of the Mortgaged Property to any Person, unless: (a) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or other transfer, or which leases, all or substantially all of the Mortgaged Property shall be a corporation, shall be organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (such corporation being hereinafter sometimes called the "Successor Corporation") and shall execute and deliver to the Trustee an indenture supplemental hereto, in form recordable and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which: (i) in the case of a consolidation, merger, conveyance or other transfer, or in the case of a lease if the term thereof extends beyond the last Stated Maturity of the Bonds then Outstanding, contains an assumption by the Successor Corporation of the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all the Bonds then Outstanding and the performance and observance of every covenant and condition of this Indenture to be performed or observed by the Company, and (ii) if prior to the Release Date, contains a grant, conveyance, transfer and mortgage by the Successor Corporation, of the same tenor of the Granting Clauses herein, (A) confirming the lien of this Indenture on the Mortgaged Property (as constituted immediately prior to the time such transaction became effective) and subjecting to the lien of this Indenture all property (other than Excepted Property), real, personal and mixed, thereafter acquired by the Successor Corporation which shall constitute an improvement, extension or addition to the Mortgaged Property (as so -107-
constituted) or a renewal, replacement or substitution of or for any part thereof, and, at the election of the Successor Corporation, (B) subjecting to the lien of this Indenture such property, real, personal or mixed, in addition to the property described in subclause (A) above, then owned or thereafter acquired by the Successor Corporation as the Successor Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, specify or describe therein, and the lien confirmed or created by such grant, conveyance, transfer and mortgage shall have force, effect and standing similar to those which the lien of this Indenture would have had if the Company had not been a party to such consolidation, merger, conveyance or other transfer and had itself, after the time such transaction became effective, purchased, constructed or otherwise acquired the property subject to such grant, conveyance, transfer and mortgage; (b) in the case of a lease, such lease shall be made expressly subject to termination by the Company or by the Trustee at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, and also by the purchaser of the property so leased at any sale thereof hereunder, whether such sale be made under the power of sale hereby conferred or pursuant to judicial proceedings; and (c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and treating any indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Company as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company at the time of such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (d) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the merger, consolidation, conveyance, lease or transfer, as the case may be, fully complies with all provisions of this Indenture; provided, however, that the delivery of such an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel shall not be required with respect to any merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease between the Company and any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may merge or consolidate with or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to an Affiliate that has no significant assets or liabilities and was formed solely for the purpose of changing the jurisdiction of organization of the Company or the form of organization of the Company or for the purpose of forming a holding company; provided that the amount of indebtedness of the Company is not increased thereby; and provided, further that the successor assumes all obligations of the Company under this Indenture.

All Bonds so executed by the Successor Corporation, and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, shall in all respects be entitled to the benefit of the lien of this Indenture equally and ratably with all Bonds executed, authenticated and delivered prior to the time such consolidation, merger, conveyance or other transfer became effective. In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, changes in phraseology and form may be made in the Bonds thereafter to be issued and the documentation thereafter to be delivered hereunder as may be appropriate to reflect such occurrence.

additions to such properties and renewals, replacements and substitutions of or for any part or parts thereof. SECTION 13.04. RELEASE OF COMPANY UPON CONVEYANCE OR OTHER TRANSFER.

SECTION 14.02. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF HOLDERS. Subject to the provisions of Section 14.01, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds of all series then Outstanding under this Indenture, considered as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, this Indenture; provided, however, that if there shall be Bonds of more than one series Outstanding hereunder and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Bonds of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or -112-
more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Bond of each series or Tranche so directly affected: (a) except as otherwise specified in the form or terms of the Bonds of any series as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01 with respect to extending the Stated Maturity of any Bond of such series, change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon (or the amount of any installment of interest thereon) or change the method of calculating such rate or reduce any premium payable thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal of any Discount Bond that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 10.02, or change the coin or currency (or other property), in which any Bond or premium, if any, or interest, if any, thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Maturity of any Bond, without, in any such case, the consent of the Holder of such Bond; or (b) prior to the Release Date, permit the creation of any Lien (not otherwise permitted hereby) ranking prior to the lien of this Indenture with respect to all or substantially all of the Mortgaged Property, or (except as expressly permitted hereunder including pursuant to Section 8.12) terminate the lien of this Indenture on all or substantially all of the Mortgaged Property or deprive the Holders of the benefit of the lien of this Indenture; or (c) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of which is required for any waiver of compliance with any provision of this Indenture or of any default hereunder and its consequences, or reduce the requirements of Section 15.04 for quorum or voting; or (d) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 7.09 or Section 10.17 with respect to the Bonds of any series or any Tranche thereof (except to increase the percentages in principal amount referred to in this Section or such other Sections or to provide that other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holders of all Bonds of such series or Tranche) without, in any such case, the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Bond of such series or Tranche; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Section 14.01(g). A supplemental indenture which (x) changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of the Holders of, or which is to remain in effect only so long as there shall be Outstanding, Bonds of one or more specified series, or one or more Tranches thereof, or (y) modifies the rights of the Holders of Bonds of such series or Tranches with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Bonds of any other series or Tranche. -113-
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Officer's Certificate, supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, as the case may be, establishing the Bonds of any series or Tranche shall provide that the Company may make certain specified additions, changes or eliminations to or from the Indenture which shall be specified in such Officer's Certificate, supplemental indenture or Board Resolution establishing such series or Tranche, (a) the Holders of Bonds of such series or Tranche shall be deemed to have consented to a supplemental indenture containing such additions, changes or eliminations to or from the Indenture which shall be specified in such Officer's Certificate, supplemental indenture or Board Resolution establishing such series or Tranche, (b) no Act of such Holders shall be required to evidence such consent and (c) such consent may be counted in the determination of whether or not the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Bonds shall have consented to such supplemental indenture. SECTION 14.03. EXECUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 11.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, immunities or liabilities under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 14.04. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Upon the execution and delivery of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Bonds theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. Any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article may restate this Indenture in its entirety, and, upon the execution and delivery thereof, any such restatement shall supersede this Indenture as theretofore in effect for all purposes. SECTION 14.05. CONFORMITY WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. SECTION 14.06.

Bonds of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Bonds of any series, or any -114-
Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Bonds of such series or Tranche. SECTION 14.07. MODIFICATION WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. To the extent, if any, that the terms of any particular series of Bonds shall have been established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or a Board Resolution as contemplated by Section 3.01, and not in a supplemental indenture, additions to, changes in or the elimination of any of such terms may be effected by means of a supplemental Board Resolution or a supplemental Officer's Certificate, as the case may be, delivered to, and accepted by, the Trustee; provided, however, that such supplemental Board Resolution or supplemental Officer's Certificate shall not be accepted by the Trustee or otherwise be effective unless all conditions set forth in this Indenture which would be required to be satisfied if such additions, changes or elimination were contained in a supplemental indenture shall have been appropriately satisfied. Upon the acceptance thereof by the Trustee, any such supplemental Board Resolution or supplemental Officer's Certificate shall be deemed to be a "supplemental indenture" for purposes of Section 14.04 and 14.06 and a "supplemental indenture", "indenture supplemental" to this Indenture or "instrument" supplemental to this Indenture for purposes of Section 7.08. ARTICLE XV MEETINGS OF HOLDERS; ACTION WITHOUT MEETING SECTION 15.01. PURPOSES FOR WHICH MEETINGS MAY BE CALLED.

A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series and Tranches represented at the meeting, considered as one class. (d) At any meeting each Holder or proxy shall be entitled to one vote for each One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) principal amount of Outstanding Bonds held or represented by such Holder; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Bond challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding.

The acceptance of this Bond shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. The Bonds of this series are subject to mandatory redemption ("Mandatory Redemption") in whole on June 23, 2004 (the "Mandatory Redemption Date"), in the event the Effective Date has not occurred on or before June 21, 2004, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Bonds of this series plus a redemption premium of ___% on such principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest from March 23, 2004 to but not including the Mandatory Redemption Date.

Subject to applicable provisions of law, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Bond shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: With respect to any Interest Determination Date (as defined below), LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars having a maturity of three months for a period commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date in amounts of not less than $1,000,000, as that rate appears on the display on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. "Moneyline Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as page "3750" on Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on any successor service for the purpose of displaying London interbank rates of major banks for U.S. dollar deposits). If no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on an Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will determine LIBOR in respect of such Interest Determination Date as follows: the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. Dollars for the period of three months commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. Dollars in such market at such time, and (a) if at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the B-6
nearest one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (0.000001%), with five-millionths of a percentage point (0.0000005%) rounded upwards) of such quotations, or (b) if fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (0.000001%), with five-millionths of a percentage point (0.0000005%) rounded upwards) of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in The City of New York, on such Interest Determination Date, by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks, having a maturity of three months commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in U.S. Dollars in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR will remain the LIBOR then in effect on such Interest Determination Date. Interest will be payable on January 3, April 3, July 3 and October 3 (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on July 3, 2004, and at Maturity. If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after maturity. "Business Day" means with respect to any Bond, any London Business Day except a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in The City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. "London Business Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. Dollars are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted, in the London interbank market. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to an Interest Reset Date will be the second London Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, interest payments, if any, will be the amount of interest accrued from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the Original Issue Date stated above if no interest has been paid or provided for with respect to this Bond) to but excluding the Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity. Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date stated above or from the last date to which interest hereon has been paid is calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date stated above or from the last date to which interest shall have been paid, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360. All percentages resulting from any calculation hereon will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. For example, 9.876545% (or B-7
..09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation hereon will be rounded to the nearest cent. The interest rate on this Bond will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by California law as the same may be modified by United States law of general applicability. The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of the Holder of this Bond, provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if different, the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a determination made on the most recent Interest Determination Date. The Bonds of this series are subject to mandatory redemption ("Mandatory Redemption") in whole on June 23, 2004 (the "Mandatory Redemption Date"), in the event the Effective Date has not occurred on or before June 21, 2004, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Bonds of this series plus a redemption premium of 1.00% on such principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest from March 23, 2004 to but not including the Mandatory Redemption Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Bonds of this series are also redeemable at the option of the Company ("Optional Redemption"), in whole or in part, on October 3, 2004 and on any Interest Payment Date thereafter and prior to Maturity, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Bonds of this series being redeemed to but not including the Redemption Date. Interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of such Bonds, or one or more Predecessor Bonds, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture. In the case of a Mandatory Redemption, a conditional notice of Mandatory Redemption will be in writing and mailed first-class postage-prepaid not less than 7 days nor more than 30 days prior to the Mandatory Redemption Date, but only if the Effective Date has not occurred on or by such date of mailing, to each Holder of Bonds of this series at the Holder's registered address. If moneys are applied to effect a Mandatory Redemption on the Mandatory Redemption Date therefor, immediately after such Mandatory Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on such Bonds. In the case of an Optional Redemption, notice of redemption will be in writing and mailed first-class postage-prepaid not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Bonds of this series to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Bonds of this series (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or prior to the Redemption Date, from and after such Redemption Date such Bonds or portions thereof shall cease to bear interest. Bonds of this series in denominations larger than $1,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000. B-8
In the event of redemption of this Bond in part only, a new Bond or Bonds of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Bond or any portion of the principal amount hereof will be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of the Indenture and to be no longer Outstanding thereunder, and the Company's entire indebtedness in respect thereof will be satisfied and discharged, if there has been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust, money in an amount which will be sufficient and/or Eligible Obligations, the principal of and interest on which when due, without regard to any reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, will be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Bond when due. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than a majority, prior to the Release Date, or 33%, on or after the Release Date, in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds, considered as one class, may declare the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders); provided, however, that with respect to certain Events of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar events, the principal amount of all Bonds then Outstanding shall be due and payable immediately without further action by the Trustee or the Holders. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, considered as one class; provided, however, that if there shall be Bonds of more than one series Outstanding under the Indenture and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Bonds of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Bonds of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that the Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for certain purposes without the consent of any Holders of Bonds. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds, on behalf of the Holders of all such Bonds, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Bond and of any Bond issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Bond. B-9
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Bond shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, the Holders of at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such written request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Bond for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Bond or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Bond at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Bond is registrable in the Bond Register, upon surrender of this Bond for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Bond are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee or the Bond Registrar, as the case may be, duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Bonds of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Bonds of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Bonds of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Bonds of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of the transfer of or the exchange of (A) any Bond of this series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers of the Bonds of this series called for redemption, or (B) any Bond of this series selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Bond of this series being redeemed in part. Prior to due presentment of this Bond for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this B-10
Bond is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Bond is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. This Bond shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereunder, except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable. As provided in the Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest with respect to this Bond, or any part thereof, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or of the indebtedness represented hereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture and all the Bonds are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance of this Bond.

The Company also agrees to indemnify the Calculation Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage, claim or expense (including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim (regardless of who asserts such claim) of liability) incurred by the Calculation Agent that arises out of or in connection with its accepting appointment as, or acting as, Calculation Agent hereunder, except such as may result from the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Calculation Agent or any of its agents or employees. The Calculation Agent shall incur no liability and shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company for, or in respect of, any actions taken, omitted to be taken or suffered to be taken in good faith by the Calculation Agent in reliance upon written instructions from the Company.
