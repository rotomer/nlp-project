Item 5.  Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure
          On April 15, 2004, the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) and Aglet Consumer Alliance (Aglet) each filed a petition with the California Court of Appeal seeking review of (1) the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) December 18, 2003 decision approving the settlement agreement
entered into among Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), PG&E Corporation and the CPUC
to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 case
(Settlement Agreement)
and (2) the CPUCs
March 16, 2004 denial of their applications for rehearing of the CPUCs December 18, 2003 decision.
 
          As previously disclosed, t
he parties executed the Settlement Agreement on December 19, 2003.  On December 22, 2003, the bankruptcy court confirmed the Utilitys plan of reorganization, which fully incorporated the Settlement Agreement.
  On April 12, 2004, the Utilitys plan of reorganization became effective. 
          CCSF and Aglet allege that the Settlement Agreement violates California law, among other claims.  CCSF requests the appellate court to hear and review the CPUCs decisions approving the Settlement Agreement and Aglet requests that the CPUCs decisions be overturned.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe the petitions are without merit and should be denied.  The Utilitys answer in opposition to the petitions for review is due May 17, 2004.
