     The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is being filed in connection with PG&E Corporation's proposed exchange offer and the related registration statement on Form S-4. The following financial information sets forth (i) PG&E Corporation's and Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (Utility) unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2003 as if the Utility's exit from Chapter 11 and the transactions related thereto, including the recognition of certain regulatory assets, had occurred at that date, and (ii) PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 as if the Utility's exit from Chapter 11 and the transactions related thereto, including the recognition of certain regulatory assets, and the effects of the rate reduction resulting from implementation of the rate design settlement approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on February 26, 2004 and related eliminations, had occurred on January 1, 2003.
     Specifically, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheets reflect the Utility's receipt of the proceeds from its recent $6.7 billion first mortgage bond offering, draws on the Utility's accounts receivable financing facility, proceeds from the Utility's fifteen month term loan and reimbursement facilities, the payment of expenses associated with these financings, the payment of, provision for or other satisfaction of allowed claims under the Utility's plan of reorganization on the effective date of its plan of reorganization, and the recognition of certain regulatory assets. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations reflect each of the foregoing transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2003, and in addition include the effects of the rate reduction resulting from implementation of the rate design settlement approved by the CPUC on February 26, 2004, elimination of reorganization professional fees and expenses, and elimination of reorganization interest income, all effective January 1, 2003.
     In the opinion of PG&E Corporation's management and the Utility's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the pro forma information have been made. These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for the purpose of showing the effects of the transactions specifically related to the Utility's exit from its Chapter 11 proceeding only and are not indicative of the operating results or the financial position that would have been achieved had the transactions described above been consummated as of the dates indicated or of the results that may be obtained in the future.
     These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the sections titled "Selected Financial Data" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the annual report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K of PG&E Corporation and the Utility dated March 2, 2004.
