 Item 1.01  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
A.            PG&E Corporation Credit Agreement
On December 10, 2004, PG&E Corporation entered into a three-year unsecured credit agreement for a $200 million revolving credit facility with BNP Paribas (BNP), as administrative agent and a lender, Deutsche Bank Securities, as syndication agent, ABN Amro Bank, N.V., Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., and Union Bank of California, N.A., as documentation agents and lenders, and the following other lenders: Barclays Bank PLC, Citicorp USA, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, Morgan Stanley Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, The Bank of Nova Scotia, and The Bank of New York  The credit facility will be used for working capital purposes.  PG&E Corporation has not made any borrowings or issued any letters of credit under the credit facility as of the date of this filing. 
The credit facility has a term of three years and all amounts will be due and payable on December 10, 2007.  Subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the credit agreement, PG&E Corporation may increase the credit facility to $300 million.  In addition, at PG&E Corporations request and at the sole discretion of each lender, the credit facility may be extended for additional periods. 
Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based, at PG&E Corporations election, on a Eurodollar rate or the base rate plus an applicable margin.  The base rate will equal the higher of BNPs announced base rate or 0.5% above the federal funds rate.  PG&E Corporation also will pay a facility fee on the total commitments of the lenders under the credit facility and a utilization fee on the average amount of extensions of credit under the credit facility during any quarter in excess of 50% of the total commitments.  Until the earlier to occur of December 10, 2005, or a downgrade of the issuer ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) by Standard & Poors or Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans is fixed at 0.70% and 0% for base rate loans, the facility fee is fixed at 0.175% and the utilization fee is fixed at 0.125%.  Thereafter, the applicable margins, facility fee and utilization fee will be based on the Utilitys issuer rating.  The applicable margins will range between 0.70% and 1.35% for Eurodollar loans and 0% and 0.5% for base rate loans.  The facility fee will range between 0.175% and 0.4% and the utilization fee will range between 0.125% and 0.25%.  In addition, PG&E Corporation will pay a fee for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility equal to the applicable margin for Eurodollar loans and a customary fee payable to BNP as the letter of credit issuer.
The credit agreement includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type, including covenants limiting the following: liens, mergers, substantial asset sales and other fundamental changes, debt, and sales of the Utilitys stock owned by PG&E Corporation.  The credit agreement also requires that PG&E Corporation maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  The limitations on debt include a maximum of $1.5 billion of debt incurred or guaranteed by PG&E Corporation prior to the resumption of regular quarterly dividends by the Utility.  In addition, at any time, the credit facility limits debt secured by the Utilitys stock owned by PG&E Corporation to $2 billion, provided that the lenders have an equal and ratable lien on such stock.
In the event of a default by PG&E Corporation under the credit agreement, including cross-defaults relating to specified other debt of PG&E Corporation or the Utility in excess of $75 million, the lenders may terminate the commitments under the credit agreement and declare the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, payable immediately.  In addition, the lenders may enforce any and all rights and remedies created under the credit facility or applicable law, including set-off rights.  For events of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the commitments are automatically terminated and the amounts outstanding become payable immediately.
The lenders and agents under the credit facility and their affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking and other advisory services to PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from PG&E Corporation and the Utility for such services.
A copy of the credit agreement is attached as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing summary of the terms of the credit agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement.
PG&E Corporations target is to establish $300 million of liquidity through a combination of $100 million in cash and the $200 million revolving credit facility discussed above.  As of December 13, 2004, when PG&E Corporation terminated its open market stock purchase program, PG&E Corporation had used approximately $32 million of the previously announced $350 million authorization to repurchase shares.  As discussed below, PG&E Corporation will use the remaining approximately $318 million to repurchase shares of its common stock on an accelerated basis.
B.       Accelerated Share Repurchase
On December 15, 2004, PG&E Corporation entered into accelerated share repurchase arrangements with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.) under which PG&E Corporation will repurchase 9,769,600 shares of its outstanding common stock at an initial price of $32.50 per share.  The repurchase will be funded from available cash on hand.  The repurchased shares will be retired.  Under the terms of the arrangements, PG&E Corporation may receive from, or be required to pay, GS&Co. a price adjustment based on the daily volume weighted average market price of PG&E Corporation common stock over a period of approximately two months.  The price adjustment can be settled, at PG&E Corporations option, in cash or in shares of its common stock.
GS&Co. may terminate the transaction (i) in the event of a default by PG&E Corporation under the accelerated share repurchase arrangements (which would include the acceleration of certain other PG&E Corporation indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $75 million), (ii) on the day before any ex-dividend date of a PG&E Corporation dividend, and (iii) in certain other circumstances.  In the event of termination in connection with the ex-dividend date, PG&E Corporation and GS&Co. may elect to enter into a new agreement to complete the original transaction.  Upon an early termination (other than when a new agreement is executed to complete the original transaction), PG&E Corporation would be required to compensate GS&Co. for losses it incurred in connection with the accelerated share repurchase transaction.
The repurchase will not have a material impact on the calculation of earnings per share for 2004 since the calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 2004.  Any shares that PG&E Corporation issues in the future in connection with an early termination of the transaction or to compensate GS&Co. for any price adjustment would increase the number of shares outstanding at the time of issuance.  In addition, until the transaction is completed or terminated, generally accepted accounting principles require PG&E Corporation to assume that it will issue shares to settle any obligation it may have at the end of a quarterly or year end reporting period to GS&Co. in relation to any increase in share price over the share price at inception of the transaction, along with other net costs with respect to the repurchased shares.  The amount of shares PG&E Corporation must treat as having been issued to settle such obligation would be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for purposes of calculating PG&E Corporations fully diluted earnings per share for that reporting period.
GS&Co. and certain of its affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in financial advisory, investment banking and other services for PG&E Corporation and its affiliates, including acting as a lender under PG&E Corporations credit agreement discussed above.

The information set forth above in Item 1.01 regarding PG&E Corporations undertaking of an accelerated share repurchase is hereby incorporated into Item 2.03(b) by reference.
Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation appointed Peter A. Darbee, 51, as President and Chief Executive Officer of PG&E Corporation to be effective January 1, 2005.  Mr. Darbee currently serves as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PG&E Corporation, a position he has held since September 20, 1999.  From September 20, 1999 to July 8, 2001, he also served as Treasurer.
Mr. Darbee would succeed Robert D. Glynn, Jr. who will retire as Chief Executive Officer and President effective January 1, 2005.  Mr. Glynn will remain Chairman of the Board of Directors of both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  He has informed PG&E Corporation and the Utility that he intends to resign as Chairman of the Board and as a director and employee effective January 1, 2006. 
The Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation also has appointed Christopher P. Johns, 44, who has been serving as Senior Vice President and Controller of PG&E Corporation since September 19, 2001, as Senior Vice President,  Chief Financial Officer, and Controller of PG&E Corporation effective January 1, 2005.  Mr. Johns served as Vice President and Controller of PG&E Corporation from July 1, 1997 to September 18, 2001.  He also served as Vice President and Controller of the Utility from June 1, 1996 to December 31, 1999. 
On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation also adopted resolutions to amend the PG&E Corporation bylaws to change the authorized number of directors from eight to ten, effective January 1, 2005.  Under PG&E Corporation's bylaws, the authorized number of directors may not be less than 7 nor more than 13, but within that range the Board of Directors may set the exact number of directors by an amendment to the bylaws.  On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Utility also adopted resolutions to amend the Utility bylaws to change the authorized number of directors from nine to eleven, effective January 1, 2005.  Under the Utilitys bylaws, the authorized number of directors may not be less than 9 nor more than 17, but within that range the Board of Directors may set the exact number of directors by an amendment to the bylaws. 
When the bylaw amendments become effective on January 1, 2005, there will be two vacancies on each Board of Directors.  Accordingly, on December 15, 2004, the Boards of Directors of each of PG&E Corporation and the Utility elected Mr. Darbee and Ms. Barbara L. Rambo to serve as directors effective January 1, 2005 to fill these vacancies.  The PG&E Corporation Board of Directors named Mr. Darbee as a member of the Executive Committee and named Ms. Rambo as a member of the Nominating, Compensation, and Governance Committee and the Finance Committee. The Utility Board of Directors named Mr. Darbee as a member of the Executive Committee of that Board.  These committee appointments also will become effective January 1, 2005.
Under PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys Corporate Governance Guidelines, at least 75% of each Board is required to be composed of independent directors, defined as directors who (1) are neither current nor former officers or employees of nor consultants to PG&E Corporation or its subsidiaries, (2) are neither current nor former officers or employees of any other corporation on whose board of directors any officer of PG&E Corporation serves as a member, and (3) otherwise meet the applicable definition of independence set forth in the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, and Pacific Exchange rules.  The Utilitys Board of Directors has temporarily waived this guideline.  Since Mr. Darbee would not be an independent director, as defined in these corporate governance guidelines, his appointment will reduce the percentage of independent members on the Board of Directors of the Utility to approximately 73% from approximately 78%.  The Board of Directors of both PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to comply with applicable stock exchange rules, which require only that a majority of the Board of Directors be independent.
There are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which Mr. Darbee or Ms. Rambo was selected as a director of PG&E Corporation or of the Utility.  Neither Mr. Darbee, Mr. Johns, nor Ms. Rambo has any relationship or related transaction with PG&E Corporation or the Utility that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.
Item 5.03 - Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
The information set forth above in Item 5.02 regarding the prospective amendment of the bylaws of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is hereby incorporated into Item 5.03 by reference.
Item 8.01 - Other Events
A.  Credit Ratings Review
On December 13, 2004, Moody's announced that it had placed the ratings of the Utility under review for possible upgrade, reflecting a number of positive regulatory developments that have occurred since the Utility emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, which Moodys states collectively strengthen the Utility's prospects for improving credit quality.  Moodys noted that its rating review will focus on the Utility's ability to complete the upcoming securitization financing through the issuance of energy recovery bonds, as well as the outcome of a number of important state regulatory decisions involving long-term resource planning, cost of capital, and the Utilitys gas business, all of which are scheduled to be rendered during December 2004 by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  In addition to the Utilitys issuer rating (currently rated Baa3), Moodys stated the ratings under review for possible upgrade include: the Utilitys first mortgage bonds, secured pollution control bonds, and secured bank loan agreement (currently rated Baa2); preferred stock (currently rated Ba2); and the Utilitys shelf registration for the issuance of first mortgage bonds and senior unsecured debt (currently rated (P)Baa2 and (P)Baa3, respectively).
B. Notice of Redemption of Utilitys Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds
On December 1, 2004, pursuant to the Utilitys instruction, the trustee under the indenture for the Utilitys Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due 2006 provided notice that $300 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds would be redeemed on January 3, 2005.  The bonds to be redeemed will be selected from all Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due 2006 in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company.  The Utility has drawn $300 million under its $850 million credit agreement to pay for the redemption.
C. Approval of Diablo Canyon Spent Fuel Storage Facility
On December 8, 2004, the California Coastal Commission (Commission) granted the Utilitys application for a coastal development permit authorizing it to proceed with its planned construction of an on-site dry cask storage facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Utilitys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant (Diablo Canyon).  As previously disclosed, in April 2004, San Luis Obispo County (County) issued a permit under the California Coastal Act, subject to a number of conditions.  The Utility, along with several other interested parties, filed appeals of the Countys decision with the Commission.  The Utilitys appeal challenged one of the conditions pertaining to the granting of public access to the coast and other portions of the Utilitys property surrounding Diablo Canyon.  The Commission granted the Utility's appeal, denied the appeals of other parties and conducted a de novo review of the application.   The Commissions December 8, 2004 decision requires that the Utility provide expanded public access to the coast and other lands surrounding Diablo Canyon, although such public access is less expansive than the County had originally required and will be subject to a one-year study process.
Further, as previously disclosed, several intervenors have filed an appeal of the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) March 2004 decision authorizing the dry cask storage facility in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Oral arguments on that appeal are expected in the first quarter of 2005 with a decision anticipated in mid-2005.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the outcome of these appeals. 
The Utility anticipates that the new dry cask storage facility will enable it to store on-site all of the spent fuel produced by Diablo Canyons Unit 1 and Unit 2 through expiration of their operating licenses in 2021 and 2024, respectively.  Barring the issuance of a judicial stay of the NRC or Commission approvals, the Utility may proceed with construction of the dry cask storage facility.
As previously disclosed, on November 3, 2004, the Utility filed an application with the NRC seeking authorization to install a temporary rack in its existing spent fuel storage pool which would increase the on-site storage capability to permit the Utility to operate Unit 1 until 2010 and Unit 2 until 2011.  This option will remain available if construction of the dry cask storage facility is delayed.  If the on-site dry cask storage facility is not completed, and the Utility is otherwise unable to increase its on-site storage capacity, it is possible that the operation of Diablo Canyon may have to be curtailed or halted as early as 2007 and until such time as additional spent fuel can be safely stored.
D.  Revised Draft ResolutionRegarding Billing Issues 
On December 9, 2004, the Energy Division of the CPUC released a revised draft resolution regarding delayed and estimated bills for comment.  Unlike the earlier draft released on November 16, 2004, the revised draft, if adopted by the CPUC, would provide a regulatory hearing process in which the CPUC can determine whether the Utility should be ordered to make refunds on, or adjustments to, previously rendered bills, as well as any other issues specified by the assigned Commissioner and the administrative law judge.  The revised resolution proposes to grant the motion filed by The Utility Reform Network (TURN) requesting that the CPUC open an investigative proceeding to review the Utilitys past billing practices.  The revised draft would require the Utility to file a report in that proceeding explaining the reasons for the amount of delayed and estimated bills for the five-year period ended December 31, 2004, and describing a plan for reducing the number of these bills.  
The revised draft resolution declares that the tariff changes included in the revised resolution, which exceed the Utilitys proposed tariff changes, are consistent with existing CPUC policy, tariffs, and requirements and simply reflect the proper interpretation of existing tariffs.  The revised draft resolution could affect the Utilitys past bills issued to customers before October 13, 2004, even though the Utilitys proposed tariff changes only would apply prospectively from the proposed October 13, 2004 effective date.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to believe that the revised draft resolution, if adopted as an order by the CPUC, would be unlawful to the extent it (i) is applied retroactively to bills issued before October 13, 2004, (ii) requires the Utility to make tariff modifications beyond those it requested in its October 15, 2004 advice letter, and (iii) grants TURNs motion.  Comments on the revised draft resolution are due December 30, 2004 with reply comments due January 6, 2005.  Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility can predict the outcome of this matter.  It is possible that the outcome would have a material adverse effect on PG&E Corporations or the Utilitys results of operations or financial condition.
E.  Authorized Share Repurchases
On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation authorized the purchase of shares of PG&E Corporation common stock directly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from time to time, but no later than June 30, 2006, through brokers and dealers on the New York Stock Exchange and/or the Pacific Exchange or in privately negotiated transactions, which may include accelerated or forward or similar stock purchases and/or the establishment of one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans with an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $975 million (excluding brokers commissions and any gains or losses incurred in connection with hedging the risk associated with changes in the market price of PG&E Corporations common stock or the settlement of outstanding liabilities with respect to repurchased shares in connection with any accelerated share repurchase program or forward or similar stock purchase program).  Such repurchases are contingent on PG&E Corporations receipt of sufficient cash from the Utility.
On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorizedthe repurchase of up to $800 million of the Utilitys common stock from PG&E Corporation, with such repurchases to be effected from time to time, but no later than December 31, 2006.  The aggregate authorized amount of stock repurchases will increase to $1.8 billion following the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the first series of Energy Recovery Bonds (ERBs) expected to be issued in January 2005 to refinance the regulatory asset provided under the settlement agreement entered into by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 proceeding (Settlement Agreement).  The actual amounts of the stock repurchases will depend upon the actual proceeds received from the ERBs, as well as the Utilitys cash from operations, capital requirements, and projected capital structure.

pro rata
share of each borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent.

        2.3
    Commitment Increases.
    
        (a)   In the event that the Borrower wishes to increase the Total Commitment at any time when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or shall result of such
increase), it shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount (the "
Revolving Credit Offered Increase Amount
") of such proposed increase (such notice, a "
Commitment Increase Notice
") in a minimum amount equal to $10,000,000. The Borrower shall offer each of the Lenders the opportunity to provide such Lender's Percentage of the Revolving Credit Offered Increase Amount, and if any Lender declines such offer, in whole or in part, the Borrower may offer such declined amount to (i) other Lenders and/or (ii) other banks, financial institutions or other entities with the consent of the Administrative Agent and, unless any such other bank, financial institution or other entity would qualify as an Eligible Assignee, the Issuing Lender (which consents of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Commitment Increase Notice shall specify the Lenders and/or banks, financial institutions or other entities that will be requested to provide such Revolving Credit Offered Increase Amount. The Borrower or, if requested by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent will notify such Lenders, and/or banks, financial institutions or other entities of such offer.
        (b)   Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which the Borrower selects to offer a portion of the increased Total Commitment and which elects to become a party to this Agreement and obtain a Commitment in an amount so offered and accepted by it pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall execute a New Lender Supplement with the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity (herein called a "
New Revolving Credit Lender
") shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement,
provided
that the Commitment of any such New Revolving Credit Lender shall be in an amount not less than $10,000,000.
        (c)   Any Lender which accepts an offer to it by the Borrower to increase its Commitment pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall, in each case, execute a Commitment Increase Supplement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit B, whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so increased.
        (d)   If any bank, financial institution or other entity becomes a New Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or any Lender's Commitment is increased pursuant to Section 2.3(c), additional Revolving Loans made on or after the effectiveness thereof (the "
Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date
") shall be made
pro rata
based on the Percentages in effect on and after such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date (except to the extent that any such
pro rata
borrowings would result in any Lender making an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans in excess of its Commitment, in which case such excess amount will be allocated to, and made by, such New Revolving Credit Lenders and/or Lenders with such increased Commitments to the extent of, and
pro rata
based on, their respective Commitments otherwise available for Revolving Loans), and continuations of Eurodollar Loans outstanding on such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date shall be effected by repayment of such Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and the making of new Eurodollar Loans
pro rata
based on such new Percentages. In the event that on any such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of ABR Loans, the Borrower shall make prepayments thereof and borrowings of ABR Loans so that, after giving effect thereto, the ABR Loans outstanding are held
pro rata
based on such new Percentages. In the event that on any such Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Loans, such Eurodollar Loans shall remain outstanding with the respective holders thereof until the expiration of their respective Interest Periods (unless the Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement), and interest on and repayments of such Eurodollar Loans will be paid thereon to the respective Lenders holding such Eurodollar Loans
pro rata
based on the respective principal amounts thereof outstanding.
        (e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.3, (i) in no event shall any transaction effected pursuant to this Section 2.3 cause the Total Commitment to exceed $300,000,000, (ii) in no event may the Borrower deliver more than one Commitment Increase Notice each year and (iii) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.
        (f)    The Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to the Revolving Credit Re-Allocation Date, for the benefit of the Lenders, (i) a legal opinion of counsel to the Borrower covering such matters as are customary for transactions of this type as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, which opinions shall be substantially the same, to the extent appropriate, as the opinions rendered by counsel to the Borrower on the Closing Date and (ii) certified copies of resolutions of the board of directors of the Borrower authorizing the Borrower to borrow the Revolving Credit Offered Increase Amount.
        2.4
    Swingline Commitment.
    
        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise available to the Borrower under the Commitments from time to time on or after the Closing Date during the Commitment Period by making swing line loans ("
Swingline Loans
") to the Borrower;
provided
that (i) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect (notwithstanding that the Swingline Loans outstanding at any time, when aggregated with the Swingline Lender's other outstanding Revolving Loans, may exceed the Swingline Commitment or the Swingline Lender's Commitment then in effect) and (ii) the Borrower shall not request, and the Swingline Lender shall not make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Swingline Loan, the aggregate amount of the Available Commitments of all Lenders would be less than zero. During the Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Swingline Loans shall be ABR Loans only.
        (b)   The Borrower shall repay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on or prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) 30 days after the date such Swingline Loan is made and (ii) the Termination Date;
provided
that on each date on which a Revolving Loan is borrowed, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.
        2.5
    Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline Loans.
    (a) Whenever the Borrower wishes to borrow Swingline Loans it shall give the Swingline Lender irrevocable telephonic notice confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the proposed Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Commitment Period). Each borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an amount equal to $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by the Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by depositing such proceeds in the account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in immediately available funds.
        (b)   The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one Business Day's notice given by the Swingline Lender no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, request each Lender to make, and each Lender hereby agrees to make, a Revolving Loan, in an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of the aggregate amount
of the Swingline Loans (the "
Refunded Swingline Loans
") outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the Swingline Lender. Each Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be immediately made available by the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender for application by the Swingline Lender to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to charge the Borrower's accounts with the Administrative Agent (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received from the Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full such Refunded Swingline Loans.
        (c)   If prior to the time a Revolving Loan would have otherwise been made pursuant to Section 2.5(b), one of the events described in Section 8(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline Lender in its sole discretion, Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section 2.5(b), each Lender shall, on the date such Revolving Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 2.5(b), purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to the Swingline Lender an amount (the "
Swingline Participation Amount
") equal to (i) such Lender's Percentage
times
(ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans.
        (d)   Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Lender such Lender's Swingline Participation Amount, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swingline Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender's
pro rata
portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due);
provided
,
however
, that in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swingline Lender.
        (e)   Each Lender's obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.5(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.5(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender or the Borrower may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
        2.6
    Facility Fees, Utilization Fees, etc.
    (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee for the period from and including the date hereof to the last day of the Commitment Period, computed at the Facility Fee Rate on the Commitment of such Lender during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. In addition, if the principal amount of any Loan, or any Reimbursement Obligations, shall remain outstanding and unpaid after the last day of the Commitment Period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a facility fee for the period from the last day of the Commitment Period until the date on which such amounts are repaid in full, computed at the Facility Fee Rate on such amounts, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on the first such date after the last day of the Commitment Period.
        (b)   If the average daily aggregate principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations outstanding for the calendar quarter preceding a Fee Payment Date (or such shorter period beginning with the date hereof or ending with the Termination Date) is 50% of the daily average Total Commitment for such calendar quarter or period, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a utilization fee at the applicable Utilization Fee Rate on such average daily aggregate principal amount of the Loans and the L/C Obligations outstanding during such calendar quarter (or shorter period), payable in arrears on each Fee Payment Date.
        (c)   The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in any written, duly executed fee agreements with the Administrative Agent and to perform any other obligations contained therein.
        2.7
    Termination or Reduction of Commitments; Extension of Termination Date.
    (a) The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments;
provided
that no such termination or reduction of Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total Commitment. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Commitments then in effect.
        (b)   The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (such notice being an "
Extension Notice
") given no more frequently than once in each calendar year, request the Lenders to consider an extension of the then applicable Termination Date to a later date. The Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit any Extension Notice to each Lender. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent whether it wishes to extend the then applicable Termination Date not later than thirty days after the date of such Extension Notice, and any such notice given by a Lender to the Administrative Agent, once given, shall be irrevocable as to such Lender. Any Lender which does not expressly notify the Administrative Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty-day period that it wishes to so extend the then applicable Termination Date shall be deemed to have rejected the Borrower's request for extension of such Termination Date. Lenders consenting to extend the then applicable Termination Date are hereinafter referred to as "
Continuing Lenders
", and Lenders declining to consent to extend such Termination Date (or Lenders deemed to have so declined) are hereinafter referred to as "
Non-Extending Lenders
". If the Required Lenders have elected (in their sole and absolute discretion) to so extend the Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of such election by the Required Lenders, and effective on the date which is thirty days after the date of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, the Termination Date shall be automatically and immediately so extended as to the Continuing Lenders. No extension will be permitted hereunder without the consent of the Required Lenders. Upon the delivery of an Extension Notice and upon the extension of the Termination Date pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on and as of the date of such Extension Notice and the effective date of such extension, as the case may be, that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to extend the Termination Date, and each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to extend the Termination Date.
        (c)   If the Termination Date shall have been extended in accordance with this Section, all references herein to the "Termination Date" (except with respect to any Non-Extending Lender) shall refer to the Termination Date as so extended.
        (d)   If any Lender shall determine (or be deemed to have determined) not to extend the Termination Date as requested by any Extension Notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender (including the obligations of such Lender under Section 2.5 and 3.4) shall terminate on the Termination Date without giving any effect to such proposed extension, and the Borrower shall on such date pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Non-Extending Lender, the principal amount of, and accrued interest on, such Non-Extending Lender's Loans and outstanding Reimbursement Obligations, together with any amounts payable to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 and any and all fees or other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender under this Agreement;
provided
that if the Borrower has replaced such Non-Extending Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) below then the provisions of such paragraph shall apply. The Total Commitment (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, except as hereinafter provided, the L/C Commitment) shall be reduced by the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender to the extent the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender has
not
been transferred to one or more Continuing Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) below,
provided
that, if the Total Commitment, after giving effect to the reduction in the Total Commitment due to Non-Extending Lenders which are not replaced pursuant to paragraph (e) below, is less than the L/C Commitment, the L/C Commitment shall be reduced by an amount equal to such excess.
        (e)   A Non-Extending Lender shall be obligated, at the request of the Borrower and subject to (i) payment by the successor Lender described below to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Non-Extending Lender of the principal amount of, and accrued interest on, such Non-Extending Lender's Loans, and (ii) payment by the Borrower to such Non-Extending Lender of any amounts payable to such Non-Extending Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 (as if the purchase of such Non-Extending Lender's Loans constituted a prepayment thereof) and any and all fees or other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender under this Agreement, to transfer without recourse, representation, warranty (other than a representation that such Lender has not created an adverse claim on its Loans) or expense to such Non-Extending Lender, at any time prior to the Termination Date applicable to such Non-Extending Lender, all of such Non-Extending Lender's rights and obligations hereunder to another financial institution or group of financial institutions nominated by the Borrower and willing to participate as a successor Lender in the place of such Non-Extending Lender;
provided
that, if such transferee is not already a Lender, (1) such transferee satisfies all the requirements of this Agreement, and (2) the Administrative Agent and, with respect to any replacement Lender that is not an Eligible Assignee, each Issuing Lender, shall have consented to such transfer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such transferee successor Lender shall be deemed to be a Continuing Lender hereunder in replacement of the transferor Non-Extending Lender and shall enjoy all rights and assume all obligations on the part of such Non-Extending Lender set forth in this Agreement. Each such transfer shall be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption.
        (f)    If the Termination Date shall have been extended in respect of Continuing Lenders in accordance with this Section, any notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2 specifying a Borrowing Date occurring after the Termination Date applicable to a Non-Extending Lender or requesting an Interest Period extending beyond such date shall (i) have no effect in respect of such Non-Extending Lender and (ii) not specify a requested aggregate principal amount exceeding the Aggregate Available Commitment (calculated on the basis of the Commitments of the Continuing Lenders).
        2.8
    Optional Prepayments.
    The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, one

provided
, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.17. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans and Swingline Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Revolving Loans which are (i) Eurodollar Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or (b) ABR Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.
        2.9
    Conversion and Continuation Options.
    (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date,
provided
that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor),
provided
that no ABR Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.
        (b)   Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans,
provided
that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Required Lenders have determined in their sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and
provided
,

, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof.
        2.10
    Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than 15 Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.
        2.11
    Interest Rates and Payment Dates.
    (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day
plus
the Applicable Margin.
        (b)   Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR
plus
the Applicable Margin.
        (c)   (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such
overdue amount shall bear interest at a default rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
plus
2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate applicable to ABR Loans
plus
2%, and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any facility fee, utilization fee, letter of credit fee, or any other fee payable (excluding any expenses or other indemnity) hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a default rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans
plus
2%, in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).
        (d)   Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date,
provided
that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand.
        2.12
    Computation of Interest and Fees.
    (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Base Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
        (b)   Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall constitute prima facie evidence of such amounts. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.11.
        2.13
    Inability to Determine Interest Rate.
    If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
        (a)   the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or
        (b)   the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to Eurodollar Loans.
        2.14
    Pro Rata Treatment and Payments; Notes.
    (a)    Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any
reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made
pro rata
according to the respective Percentages of the Lenders.
        (b)   Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made
pro rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders. Each payment in respect of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be made to the Issuing Lender that issued such Letters of Credit.
        (c)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, Reimbursement Obligations, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, as applicable, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
        (d)   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans from the Borrower within 30 days after written demand therefor.
        (e)   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective
pro rata
shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum
equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
        (f)    The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note (a "
Note
") of the Borrower evidencing any Revolving Loans of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit H, with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount;
provided
, that delivery of Notes shall not be a condition precedent to the occurrence of the Closing Date or the making of Loans on the Closing Date.
        2.15
    Requirements of Law.
    (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
          (i)  shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes covered by Section 2.16 and net income taxes and franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes);
         (ii)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate, which requirements are generally applicable to loans made by such Lender; or
        (iii)  shall impose on such Lender any other condition that is generally applicable to loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, within ten Business Days after its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled;
provided
,
however
, that no Lender shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following (x) the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which such demand is made or (y) the repayment of the Loan or Swingline Loan in respect of which such demand is made, and no Issuing Lender shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following the expiration or termination (by drawing or otherwise) of the Letter of Credit issued by it in respect of which such demand is made.
        (b)   If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such
Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
        (c)   A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall constitute prima facie evidence of such costs or amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect not to exceed twelve months. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts then due and payable hereunder.
        2.16
    Taxes.
    (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding (i) net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document) and (ii) any branch profits tax imposed by the United States. If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("
Non-Excluded Taxes
") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement,
provided
,
however
, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.
        (b)   In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
        (c)   Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of any original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
        (d)   Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "
Non-U.S. Lender
") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or,
in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver;
provided
,
however
, if any Non-U.S. Lender fails to file forms with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, with the Lender from which the related participation was purchased) on or before the date the Non-U.S. Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchased the related participation) entitling the Non-U.S. Lender to a complete exemption from United States withholding taxes at such time, such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to receive any increased payments from the Borrower with respect to United States withholding taxes under paragraph (a) of this Section, except to the extent that the Non-U.S. Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of the assignment to the Non-U.S. Lender, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to United States withholding taxes.
        (e)   A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
provided
that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
        (f)    If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (
plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
        (g)   The agreements in this Section shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
        2.17
    Indemnity.
    The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss (other than the loss of Applicable Margin) or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive for 90 days after the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
        2.18
    Change of Lending Office.
    Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.15 or 2.16(a) or (b) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;
provided
, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole but reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no unreimbursed economic disadvantage, or any legal or regulatory disadvantage, and
provided
,
further
, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a).
        2.19
    Replacement of Lenders.
    The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests (on its behalf or any of its Participants) reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial institution;
provided
that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.18 which eliminates the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.17 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (
provided
that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
        3.1
    L/C Commitment.
    
        (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue standby letters of credit ("
Letters of Credit
") for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day on or after the Closing Date and during the Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender;
provided
, that no Issuing Lender shall issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension or renewal (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Commitments would be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date which is five Business Days prior to the Termination Date;
provided
that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).
        (b)   No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance, amendment, extension or renewal would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.
        3.2
    Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit.
    The Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request. Concurrently with the delivery of an Application to an Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall deliver a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of any Application, an Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower (but in no event shall any Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto). Promptly after issuance by an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower. Each Issuing Lender shall promptly give notice to the Administrative Agent of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender (including the amount thereof), and shall provide a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Administrative Agent as soon as possible after the date of issuance.
        3.3
    Fees and Other Charges.
    
        (a)   The Borrower will pay a fee on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued in an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.
        (b)   In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending, renewing or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.
        3.4
    L/C Participations.
    
        (a)   Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Percentage in each Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein (and thereafter the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Lender) an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
        (b)   If any amount (a "
Participation Amount
") required to be paid by any L/C Participant to an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify the L/C Participants, and each L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Lender, on demand (and thereafter the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Lender) an amount equal to the product of (i) such Participation Amount,
times
(ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender,
times
(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any Participation Amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such Participation Amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted on behalf of an Issuing Lender to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
        (c)   Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from the Administrative Agent any L/C Participant's
pro rata
share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof,
such Issuing Lender will distribute to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Participant (and thereafter the Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to such L/C Participant) its
pro rata
share thereof;
provided

    The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender on (i) the Business Day on which the Borrower receives notice from an Issuing Lender of a draft drawn on a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender and paid by such Issuing Lender, if such notice is received on such Business Day prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day on which the Borrower receives such notice, for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment which are obligations of the Borrower hereunder (the amounts described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) in respect of any drawing, collectively, the "
Payment Amount

The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Loans (or, if applicable, Swingline Loans) could be made, pursuant to Section 2.1 (or, if applicable, Section 2.4), if the Administrative Agent had received a notice of such borrowing at the time the Administrative Agent receives notice from the relevant Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.
        3.6
    Obligations Absolute
    The Borrower's obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person; other than with respect to any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the related drafts or documents found to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct or not in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions which resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the
standards or care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower.
        3.7
    Letter of Credit Payments
    If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the relevant Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, shall be limited, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct or failure to act in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
        3.8
    Applications
    To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.
        3.9
    Actions of Issuing Lenders
    Each Issuing Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by such Issuing Lender. Each Issuing Lender shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, as between the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders, each Issuing Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Letter of Credit.

provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, any Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Issuing Lender in determining whether a request presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit and in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York or (y) such Issuing Lender's failure to pay under
any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. Nothing in this Section is intended to limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.
        3.11
    Lenders' Indemnification.
    Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Percentage, indemnify each Issuing Lender, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct or failure to comply with the standard of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York or such Issuing Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Section or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.
        To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, on the date hereof, on the Closing Date and on the date of each Loan and each issuance or extension of a Letter of Credit hereunder after the Closing Date, that:
        4.1
    Financial Condition.
    The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2004, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine-month period ended on such date, present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved. Except as disclosed in the Specified Exchange Act Filings, neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has as of the Closing Date any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or forward or long-term commitments outside of the ordinary course of business, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph.
        4.2
    No Change.
    Since December 31, 2003, there has been no development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as disclosed in the Specified Exchange Act Filings.
        4.3
    Existence; Compliance with Law.
    Each of the Borrower and its Significant Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (b) has the corporate power and corporate authority to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other organization and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification except to the extent that the failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        4.4
    Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.
    The Borrower has the corporate power and corporate authority to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents and to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. The Borrower has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except consents, authorizations, filings and notices which have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect. This Agreement has been, and each other Loan Document upon execution and delivery will be, duly executed and delivered. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (x) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, laws of general application related to the enforceability of securities secured by real estate and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law) and (y) applicable regulatory requirements.
        4.5
    No Legal Bar.
    The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate in any material respect any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation. No Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
        4.6
    Litigation.
    (a) No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened in writing by or against the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or against any of their material respective properties or revenues with respect to any of the Loan Documents.
        (b)   No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened in writing by or against the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or against any of their material respective properties or revenues, except as disclosed in the Specified Exchange Act Filings, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Adverse Effect). No tax Liens have been filed against the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries other than (A) Liens for taxes which are not delinquent or (B) Liens for taxes which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, as applicable.
        4.9
    Federal Regulations.
    No part of the proceeds of any Loans, and no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used for "buying" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board.
        4.10
    ERISA.
    Neither a Reportable Event (other than the Post-event Notices of Reportable Events filed with the PBGC on May 2, 2001, in respect of the April 6, 2001, bankruptcy filing of PG&E Utility and on July 16, 2003, in respect of the July 8, 2003, bankruptcy filing of National Energy & Gas Transmission) nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA, and neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any material liability under ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.
        4.11
    Investment Company Act; Other Regulations.
    The Borrower is not an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

        4.12
    Use of Proceeds.

        (b)   neither the Borrower nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries has received or is aware of any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the business operated by the Borrower and its Significant Subsidiaries (the "
Business
"), nor does the Borrower have knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened;
        (c)   Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location that, to the Borrower's knowledge, would give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that, to the Borrower's knowledge, would give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law;
        (d)   no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business;
        (e)   there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to the operations of the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries in connection with the Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or in amounts or in a manner that, to the Borrower's knowledge, would give rise to liability under Environmental Laws;
        (f)    the Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance, and have in the last five years been in compliance, with all applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business; and
        (g)   neither the Borrower nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries has assumed any liability of any other Person under Environmental Laws.
        4.14
    Accuracy of Information, etc.
    No statement or information (other than projections, parent-only financial statements and
pro forma
information) contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Confidential Information Memorandum or any other document, certificate or statement furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such statement, information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the Confidential Information Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading when taken as a whole. The projections, parent-only financial statements and
pro forma
financial information contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. There is no fact known to the Borrower that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been expressly disclosed herein, in the other Loan Documents, in the Confidential Information Memorandum (including any attachments thereto) or in any other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents.
        4.15

    The Borrower is a "holding company" exempt from all provisions of PUHCA (except for Section 9(a)(2) thereof) pursuant to Section 3(a)(i) thereof and Rule 2 thereunder. Solely by virtue of the execution, delivery and performance of, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no Lender shall be or become subject to regulation (i) as a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of PUHCA, (ii) under the FPA or (iii) as a "public utility" or "public service corporation" or the equivalent under any Requirement of Law.

In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.

    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.

Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its affiliates.

    Indemnification.
    The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive for two years after repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
        9.8
    Agent in Its Individual Capacity.
    Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.
        9.9
    Successor Administrative Agent.
    The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "
Administrative Agent
" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
        9.10
    Documentation Agents and Syndication Agent.
    None of the Documentation Agents or the Syndication Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.
        10.1
    Amendments and Waivers.
    Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Required Lenders and the Borrower may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences;

         (ii)  eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this Section 10.1 or Section 10.6(a)(i) without the written consent of such Lender;

        Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.
        If the Required Lenders shall have approved any amendment which requires the consent of all of the Lenders, the Borrower shall be permitted to replace any non-consenting Lender with another financial institution,
provided
that, (i) the replacement financial institution shall purchase at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (ii) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.17 if any Eurodollar Loan
owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto (as if such purchase constituted a prepayment of such Loans), (iii) such replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, with respect to any replacement financial institution that is not an Eligible Assignee, each Issuing Lender, (iv) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (
provided
that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (v) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

        (a)   The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.
        (b)   (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an "
Assignee
") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:
        (A)  the Borrower,
provided
that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Eligible Assignee that is an affiliate of any Lender party to this Agreement on the Closing Date or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and
        (B)  the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender,
provided
that (1) no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment, and (2) no consent of any Issuing Lender shall be required for any assignment to an Eligible Assignee.
         (ii)  Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
        (A)  except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Eligible Assignee that is an affiliate of any Lender party to this Agreement on the Closing Date or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,
provided
that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) with respect to any Lender party to this Agreement on the Closing Date, such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of such Lender and any affiliate of such Lender that is an Eligible Assignee;
        (B)  the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and
        (C)  the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire.
        (iii)  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.5 but shall be subject to the limitations set forth therein). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
        (iv)  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, each Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
         (v)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
        (c)   (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
         (ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent to such greater payments. Any Participant that is a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless such Participant complies with Section 2.16(d).
        (d)   Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
        (e)   The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.
        (f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 10.6(b). Each of the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender;
provided
, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage, expense, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits or any kind whatsoever arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.
        (g)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, none of the Agents, in their capacity as Lenders, will assign without the consent of the Borrower, prior to the Closing Date, any of the Commitments held by them on the date of this Agreement.
        10.7
    Adjustments; Set-off.
    (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if any Lender (a "
Benefitted Lender
") shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it hereunder, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender hereunder, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender hereunder, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
        (b)   In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, including other rights of set-off, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), after any applicable grace period, to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch, affiliate or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender,
provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
        10.8

    Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
EXHIBIT A
        Reference is made to the $200,000,000 Credit Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2004, as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time (the "

        3.     The New Lender (a) represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into this New Lender Supplement; (b) confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Credit Agreement and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this New Lender Supplement; (c) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (d) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Credit Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will be bound by the provisions of the Credit Agreement and will perform in accordance with its terms all the obligations which by the terms of the Credit Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
        4.     The effective date of this New Lender Supplement shall be the Effective Date of the New Commitment described in Schedule 1 hereto (the "
