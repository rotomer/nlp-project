Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
          The information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K.
          On May 4, 2005, PG&E Corporation issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 announcing its financial results and the financial results of its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.  Additional supplemental information relating to PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys financial results is attached as Exhibit 99.2.  This additional supplemental financial information also will be posted on the Investors section of PG&E Corporations website at www.pgecorp.com.  Much of this information is derived from the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 to be filed by PG&E Corporation and the Utility with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read in conjunction with such Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
          PG&E Corporation presents results and guidance on an earnings from operations basis in order to provide investors with a measure that reflects the underlying financial performance of the business and offers investors a basis on which to compare performance from one period to another, exclusive of items that, in managements judgment, are not reflective of the normal course of operations.
          The attached exhibits contain forward-looking statements regarding 2005 and 2006 guidance for earnings per common share from operations for PG&E Corporation and estimates of the Utilitys rate base for 2005 and 2006 that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions which management believes are reasonable, including that the Utility earns an authorized return on equity of 11.22 percent, that the second series of energy recovery bonds is issued in November 2005, and that the Utility makes certain capital expenditures.  In addition to the risk that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include:
The timing and resolution of the pending appeals of the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) approval of the settlement agreement entered into on December 19, 2003 by PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 proceeding, or the Settlement Agreement, and the bankruptcy courts confirmation of the Utilitys plan of reorganization,     
Unanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures, which may affect the Utilitys ability to earn its authorized rate of return;     
The level and volatility of wholesale electricity and natural gas prices and supplies, the Utilitys ability to manage and respond to the levels and volatility successfully and the extent to which the Utility is able to timely recover increased costs related to such volatility;     
The operation of the Utilitys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant which exposes the Utility to potentially significant environmental costs and capital expenditure outlays;     
The impact of current and future ratemaking actions of the CPUC, including the risk of material differences between forecasted costs used to determine rates and actual costs incurred;     
Whether the assumptions and forecasts underlying the Utilitys CPUC-approved long-term electricity procurement plan prove to be accurate, the terms and conditions of the generation or procurement commitments the Utility enters into in connection with its plan, the extent to which the Utility is able to recover the costs it incurs in connection with these commitments, and the extent to which a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to the Utilitys electricity purchase contracts or the California Department of Water Resources contracts allocated to the Utilitys customers affects the Utilitys ability to meet its obligations or to recover its costs;     
The extent to which the CPUC or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission delays or denies recovery of the Utilitys costs, including electricity purchase costs, from customers due to a regulatory determination that such costs were not reasonable or prudent or for other reasons, resulting in write-offs of regulatory balancing accounts;     
How the CPUC administers the capital structure, standalone dividend, and first priority conditions of the CPUCs decisions permitting the establishment of holding companies for the California investorowned electric utilities;     
The impact of future legislative or regulatory actions or policies;     
Increased competition;     
The outcome of pending litigation; and     
Other factors discussed in PG&E Corporation's SEC reports.

PG&E CORP. REPORTS SOLID FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Net income for PG&E Corporation was $0.54 per share, compared with $7.15 per share in the same quarter of 2004, which included large non-cash items associated with the settlement resolving Pacific Gas and Electric Companys Chapter 11 case. (All per share amounts in this release are common shares on a diluted basis.)       
Earnings from operations for PG&E Corporation were $0.56 per share, up from $0.41 per share in the same quarter of 2004.
           (San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $218 million, or $0.54 per share, in the first quarter of 2005.  Last year in the first quarter, consolidated net income was $3.03 billion, or $7.15 per share.            For Pacific Gas and Electric Company only, net income in accordance with GAAP was $219 million for the quarter, compared with approximately $3.1 billion for the same quarter last year.  In 2004, first quarter results included large one-time, non-cash items recorded in connection with the approval of the settlement agreement to resolve Pacific Gas and Electric Companys Chapter 11 proceeding.           First quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation President and CEO. Our performance continues to reflect solid utility operations, a healthy financial profile and a stable business climate.  Since the start of 2005, weve declared and paid our first common dividend since late 2000, executed a substantial common stock repurchase program, and completed the first of a two-part refinancing that will help save customers up to $1 billion over time.
EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS
          On a non-GAAP, earnings-from-operations basis, PG&E Corporation earned $226 million, or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of 2005, compared with $175 million, or $0.41 per share in the first quarter last year.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company contributed $227 million, or $0.56 per share, to earnings from operations in the first quarter, compared with $180 million, or $0.42 per share, in the first quarter of last year.            Earnings from operations excludes certain non-operating income and expenses reported in GAAP net income. These items are shown as Items Impacting Comparability on the accompanying financial tables, which reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP.  For the first quarter, items impacting comparability totaled $0.02 per share, reflecting the net interest expense associated with Chapter 11 claims that are still pending.            As disclosed in the Corporations quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter, accounting for stock options as an expense in the quarter would have reduced earnings by less than $0.01 per share.  
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISON
          The difference in PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the first quarter of 2005 compared with first quarter 2004 results primarily from the timing of last years final decision in Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2003 General Rate Case.  Because the decision was received in May of last year, first quarter 2004 results did not include its effects, which would have added approximately $0.15 per share to earnings from operations.           Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter difference was an additional $0.03 per share in 2005, reflecting increased earnings on the equity portion of Pacific Gas and Electric Companys rate base (the equity portion of rate base grew from about 48 percent in the first quarter last year to 52 percent in January 2005).  An additional increase of $0.02 per share in 2005 is attributable to the effects of fewer shares outstanding, with another $0.02 per share reflecting other miscellaneous items.           Partially offsetting these items, the company raised its forecast of environmental remediation costs by about $0.03 per share, after updating estimates to complete work at a number of existing sites.            Also impacting the quarter-over-quarter difference in earnings from operations was a reduction of about $0.04 per share in earnings associated with the regulatory asset established under the settlement resolving Pacific Gas and Electric Companys Chapter 11 case. The company securitized the regulatory asset in February 2005, and as a result, earned a return on the asset for only a portion of the first quarter, compared with a full quarter of returns last year. 
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
          PG&E Corporation is reaffirming its previously issued 2005 guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share, and its 2006 guidance in a range of $2.30 to $2.40 per share.            PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP.
