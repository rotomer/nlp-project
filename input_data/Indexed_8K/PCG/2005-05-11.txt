Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2006 Cost of Capital Application
          On May 9, 2005, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility), a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, filed a cost of capital application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to determine the Utility's authorized capital structure and the authorized rate of return that the Utility may earn on its electricity and natural gas distribution and electricity generation rate base for test year 2006.  In the cost of capital proceeding, the CPUC (1) establishes the proportions of common equity, preferred equity, and debt that will comprise the Utility's total authorized capital structure for a specific year, and (2) establishes the rate of return that the Utility is authorized to earn on the common equity, preferred equity, and debt components of its capital structure.
          The Utility has requested an authorized return on equity (ROE) of 11.50% for its gas and electric distribution operations and its electric generation operations, as compared to the currently authorized ROE of 11.22%.  The Utility has requested a cost of debt of 6.05% (a slight decrease from the currently authorized 6.10%) and a cost of preferred stock of 5.87% (reduced from the currently authorized level of 6.42%).  The Utility has requested that the equity component of its authorized capital structure for 2006 remain at 52.0%, that the long-term debt component be increased to 46.0%, and that the preferred equity component be reduced to 2.0%.  The recommended capital structure and associated rate of return for each component would result in an overall rate of return of 8.88% for 2006, an increase from the currently authorized rate of return of 8.77%.  The following table compares the currently authorized amounts with the requested amounts:
    
          Under the December 2003 settlement agreement entered into among the Utility, PG&E Corporation, and the CPUC to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 case, the Utility is entitled to earn a ROE of at least 11.22% on an authorized 52.0% equity ratio until the Utilitys long-term issuer credit ratings are at least A- from Standard & Poors (S&P) or A3 from Moodys Investors Service (Moodys).  The Utilitys corporate credit ratings are currently BBB from S&P and Baa1 from Moody's. 
          The Utilitys proposed cost of capital would cause its cost of capital revenue requirement for 2006 to increase by approximately $17.8 million, or 0.2%, over currently authorized revenue requirements for electric distribution and generation operations and approximately $4 million, or 0.1%, over currently authorized revenue requirements for gas distribution operations, based on currently authorized rate base. 
          The Utility did not include a request for a 2006 rate of return for its electric network transmission operations in this application to the CPUC because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates electric transmission rates.  Also, the Utility did not include a request for a 2006 rate of return for its gas transmission and storage operations because the CPUC previously set revenue requirements for the Utilitys gas transmission and storage assets until 2007 in a separate proceeding.
          The Utility has proposed that any changes to its electric and gas revenue requirements resulting from adjustments to its authorized 2006 test year cost of capital be effective January 1, 2006.  The Utility has proposed a procedural schedule for its cost of capital application that contemplates that hearings would begin September 12, 2005, and that the assigned administrative law judge would issue a proposed decision by November 18, 2005, and a final decision by the end of the year.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding.
