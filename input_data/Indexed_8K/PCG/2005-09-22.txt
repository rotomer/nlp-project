Item 8.01 Other Events
               On September 22, 2005, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted to approve the Utilitys application to spend up to $49 million on pre-deployment activities to implement an advanced metering infrastructure for residential and small commercial customers.  The CPUC authorized the Utility to recover from customers up to $11.7 million in pre-deployment expenses and $37.4 million in pre-deployment capital additions.  The pre-deployment phase consists of activities to prepare the Utilitys existing systems to accept data from its proposed advanced metering system, and to establish and test processes for meter and communication system installation and billing.  The authorized pre-deployment funding translates into combined electric and gas distribution revenue requirements of approximately $13.8 million in 2005, $6.3 million in 2006, and $6.2 million in 2007. 
               As previously reported, in a separate proceeding in June 2005, the Utility filed with the CPUC an application for deployment of its full advanced metering infrastructure project at an estimated cost of $1.46 billion, including an estimated capital cost of $1.26 billion, based on a five-year installation schedule for virtually all of the Utility's electric and gas customers starting in 2006.  A final CPUC decision is expected in May 2006.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict whether the CPUC will approve this application.
