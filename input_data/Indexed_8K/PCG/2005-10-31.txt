Item 8.01 Other Events
Explanatory Note:
On October 28, 2005, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) filed a joint Current Report on Form 8-K (Report) that is being amended to restate in its entirety the text appearing under Item 8.01 as set forth below.  No other changes are being made to the Report or to the exhibits filed or furnished with the Report.  
            
Reclassification of Restricted Cash
As previously disclosed in PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) joint quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, PG&E Corporation and the Utility changed the way they classify changes in certain restricted cash balances presented in their condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the reported quarterly period to present such changes as an investing activity.  These changes in restricted cash balances were previously presented as an operating activity.
            
Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto consists of  Exhibit 13 (portions of PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders) to their joint Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (2004 Form 10-K), including the financial statements, the notes thereto, and the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that have been revised to reflect the Utilitys reclassification of changes in certain restricted cash balances as an investing activity rather than an operating activity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  This reclassification also changes one of the financial statement schedules included with the 2004 Form 10-K.  This revised financial statement schedule, Condensed Financial Information of Parent, is attached as Exhibit 99.2.  In addition, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 is PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 (First Quarter 2005 Form 10-Q) that has been revised to reflect the Utilitys reclassification of changes in certain restricted cash balances as an investing activity rather than an operating activity for the three months ended March 31, 2005.  There was no impact on PG&E Corporations or the Utilitys consolidated statements of operations, or shareholders equity as a result of these changes. 
            
Except as described above, no other changes have been made to the portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders included as Exhibit 13 to the 2004 Form 10-K and no other changes have been made to the First Quarter 2005 Form 10-Q.   The attached Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3 do not update any other disclosures to reflect developments since the 2004 Form 10-K or the First Quarter 2005 Form 10-Q were filed.
            
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are filing this report at this time in light of the anticipated issuance of the second series of energy recovery bonds by PG&E Energy Recovery Funding LLC, or PERF, in November 2005.  Although PERF is a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Utility, the assets of PERF are not legally available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility, and neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility are liable for the debts of PERF.
