ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
          The information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99, is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K.
          On November 7 and 8, 2005, members of PG&E Corporations management will participate in meetings during the Edison Electric Institute Fall Financial Conference at which the presentation attached hereto as Exhibit 99 will be used.
          The attached Exhibit 99 contains forward-looking statements regarding guidance for 2005 and 2006 earnings from operations per share, cash flows, capital expenditures, rate base and rate base growth, stock repurchases and dividends.  These statements are based on certain assumptions, including that the Utility earns its authorized rate of return on equity of 11.22 percent and the issuance of the second series of energy recovery bonds in later 2005. These statements are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties the realization or resolution of which are outside of managements control.  These statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and managements knowledge of facts at the time the statements were made.   Actual results could differ materially.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements and assumptions include:
 
Unanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures, which may affect the Utilitys ability to earn its authorized rate of return;
The adequacy of natural gas supplies and the effect of increasing prices for natural gas on the Utilitys electric generation portfolio and its natural gas distribution operations, the ability of the Utility to manage and respond to increasing natural gas costs successfully and to timely recover its natural gas costs and increased electricity procurement costs;
The operation of the Utilitys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, which exposes the Utility to potentially significant environmental costs and capital expenditure outlays, and the extent to which the Utility is able to timely increase its spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at Diablo Canyon by 2007;
The outcome of proceedings pending at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC);
Whether the assumptions and forecasts underlying the Utilitys CPUC-approved long-term electricity procurement plan prove to be accurate, the terms and conditions of the generation or procurement commitments the Utility enters into in connection with its plan, the extent to which the Utility is able to recover the costs it incurs in connection with these commitments, and the extent to which a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to the Utilitys electricity purchase contracts or the California Department of Water Resources contracts allocated to the Utilitys customers affects the Utilitys ability to meet its obligations or to recover its costs;
The extent to which the CPUC or the FERC delays or denies recovery of the Utilitys costs, including electricity purchase costs, from customers due to a regulatory determination that such costs were not reasonable or prudent or for other reasons, resulting in write-offs of regulatory balancing accounts;
How the CPUC administers the capital structure, stand-alone dividend, and first priority conditions of the CPUCs decisions permitting the establishment of holding companies for the California investor-owned electric utilities, and the outcome of the CPUC's new rulemaking proceeding concerning the relationship between the California investor-owned energy utilities and their holding companies and non-regulated affiliates;
The impact of the recently adopted Energy Policy Act of 2005 and future legislative or regulatory actions or policies affecting the energy industry;
The timing and resolution of the pending appeal of the bankruptcy courts confirmation of the Utilitys plan of reorganization;
The outcome of the litigation pending against the Utility in California state court involving allegations of injury allegedly caused by exposure to chromium at certain of the Utility's gas compressor stations and other pending litigation;
Increased competition and forms of bypass; and
Other factors discussed in PG&E Corporation's SEC reports.
