PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS; RAISES 2006 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $180 million, or $0.49 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $871 million, or $2.04 per share, which reflected a $1.60 per share one-time, non-cash gain associated with PG&E Corporations exit from its national energy business.
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the fourth quarter were $179 million, or $0.49 per share, compared with $186 million, or $0.44 per share, in the same quarter of 2004. Earnings from operations exclude certain non-operating income and expenses reported in GAAP net income (see Items Impacting Comparability in the accompanying financial tables, which reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP.)
PG&E Corporations earnings per share from operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased over the same period in 2004 reflecting the positive impacts of share repurchases, the current year portion of the gain associated with a California Public Utilities Commission decision related to shareholder incentives for successfully implementing conservation programs (Annual Earnings Assessment Proceedings or AEAP), and higher equity earnings on rate base among other items. These items were partially offset primarily by the loss of earnings associated with the settlement regulatory asset, which was refinanced and eliminated during 2005.
 
 
Weve executed our 2005 plan to completely restore PG&Es financial health - restarting and increasing the dividend, repurchasing stock and announcing plans for utility infrastructure investments, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of PG&E Corporation. As we begin 2006, were focused on transforming our business so that we can provide our customers with faster, better and more cost-efficient services while delivering value to our shareholders.
On a stand-alone basis, PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiary GAAP results were $183 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $243 million in the same quarter of 2004. The utilitys non-GAAP earnings from operations for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $181 million, compared with $191 million in the same quarter of 2004.
FULL-YEAR 2005 RESULTS
For the full year 2005, PG&E Corporations reported GAAP results were $917 million, or $2.37 per share. Total consolidated net income in 2004 was $4.5 billion, or $10.57 per share, of which $8.52 per share reflected two one-time, non-cash items relating to Pacific Gas and Electric Companys Chapter 11 resolution and PG&E Corporations exit from its national energy business.
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations were $906 million or $2.34 per share in 2005, compared with $901 million, or $2.12 per share in 2004.
The increase in earnings per share from operations for 2005 compared with 2004 reflected the positive impacts of share repurchases, higher equity earnings on rate base, higher gas transmission revenues, and electric transmission contract settlements among other items. These other items were partially offset primarily by the loss of earnings associated with the settlement regulatory asset and increased environmental remediation costs.
Items not included in earnings from operations totaled $0.03 per share, primarily reflecting the costs of the recently announced settlement to resolve most of the chromium litigation against the utility, a gain from tax adjustments related to PG&E Corporations national energy business, and the prior years portion of the gains associated with the AEAP settlement.
 
 
 On a stand-alone basis in 2005, Pacific Gas and Electric Companys GAAP results were $918 million, compared to $3.96 billion for 2004. The utilitys non-GAAP earnings from operations for 2005 were $919 million, compared to $931 million, for 2004.
   
  
2006 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
PG&E Corporation is raising its previously issued guidance for 2006 earnings from operations by $0.05 per share to the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Guidance assumes that the utility earns its higher authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent on anticipated rate base for 2006, decreased for the impact of the equity carrying cost credit associated with the Rate Reduction Bonds and Energy Recovery Bonds, and the interest expense of PG&E Corporation debt.
This guidance is in line with PG&E Corporations recently announced target average annual growth rate of approximately 7.5 percent for earnings per share from operations for the period 2006-2010. This reflects the positive impact of share repurchases and the substantial annual capital investment forecast for the utility.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP.
MARCH 1 ANALYST MEETING
PG&E Corporation will discuss its business and strategic focus, capital spending plans, and multi-year financial outlook during its upcoming Analyst Meeting on Wednesday, March 1, 2006 in New York City. The meeting for members of the financial community will be available to the public via webcast beginning at 8:30 a.m. EST at http://www.pge-corp.com/investors/investor_info/presentations/index.shtml. Because the meeting so closely follows todays earnings announcement, PG&E Corporation will not hold its regular quarterly conference call for analysts.
Supplemental Financial Information:
In addition to the financial information accompanying this release, an expanded package of supplemental financial material for the quarter will be furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and also will be available shortly on PG&E Corporations website (www.pgecorp.com).
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding managements guidance for PG&E Corporations 2006 earnings per share from operations and targeted average annual growth rate for earnings per share from operations over the 2006-2010 period.
