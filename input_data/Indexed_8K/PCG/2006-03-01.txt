Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
         The information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99, is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K.
          On March 1, 2006, members of PG&E Corporations and Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (Utility) management will participate in an investor conference using the presentation slides attached hereto as Exhibit 99. 
A webcast of the investor conference and a copy of the presentation slides are available on PG&E Corporation's web site,
www.pgecorp.com
.
          The attached Exhibit 99 contains forward-looking statements regarding management's guidance for PG&E Corporation's 2006 and 2007 earnings from operations per share, capital expenditures, rate base and rate base growth, anticipated share repurchases and equity issuances, anticipated costs and benefits from Transformation initiatives, anticipated electric resources, energy efficiency funding, forecasted electric and gas sales, and targeted average annual growth rate for PG&E Corporation's earnings per share from operations, and cash flow and liquidity, over the 2006-2010 period.  These statements are based on current expectations and various assumptions which management believes are reasonable, including that substantial capital investments are made in Utility business over the 2006-2010 period, that the Utility earns an authorized return on equity of 11.35%, and that share repurchases are made. These statements are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties the realization or resolution of which are outside of managements control.  Actual results could differ materially.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements and assumptions include:
Unanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures, which may affect the Utilitys ability to earn its authorized rate of return;  
How the Utility manages its responsibility to procure electric capacity and energy for its customers;  
The adequacy and price of natural gas supplies, the ability of the Utility to manage and respond to the volatility of the natural gas market for its customers;  
The operation of the Utilitys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, which could cause the Utility to incur potentially significant environmental costs and capital expenditures, and the extent to which the Utility is able to timely increase its spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at Diablo Canyon;  
Whether the Utility is able to recognize the anticipated cost benefits and savings to result from its Transformation efforts to improve customer service through implementation of specific initiatives to streamline business processes and deploy new technology;  
The outcome of proceedings pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), including the Utilitys general rate case and the CPUCs pending investigation into the Utilitys billing and collection practices;  
How the CPUC administers the capital structure, stand-alone dividend, and first priority conditions of the CPUCs decisions permitting the establishment of holding companies for the California investor-owned electric utilities, and the outcome of the CPUC's new rulemaking proceeding concerning the relationship between the California investor-owned energy utilities and their holding companies and non-regulated affiliates;  
The impact of the recently adopted Energy Policy Act of 2005 and future legislative or regulatory actions or policies affecting the energy industry;  
The outcome of the litigation pending against the Utility in California state court involving allegations of injury allegedly caused by exposure to chromium at certain of the Utility's gas compressor stations and other pending litigation;  
Increased municipalization and other forms of bypass in the Utilitys service territory; and  
Other factors discussed in PG&E Corporation's and the Utility's SEC reports.
