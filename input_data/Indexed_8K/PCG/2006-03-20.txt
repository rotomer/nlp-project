Item 8.01 Other Events
On March 16, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) dismissed as moot an appeal of the order issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California that confirmed Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Utilitys plan of reorganization became effective on April 12, 2004. The appeal was filed by two former commissioners of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) who did not vote to approve the December 19, 2003 settlement agreement among PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and the CPUC to resolve the Utilitys Chapter 11 case.
The Ninth Circuits decision will become final on June 14, 2006, 90 days after entry of judgment, assuming that the former commissioners do not file either a petition for rehearing with the Ninth Circuit or a petition seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
