PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $214 million, or $0.60 per share, in the first quarter of 2006. In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $218 million, or $0.54 per share.
On a stand-alone basis, PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiary GAAP results were $214 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared with $219 million in the same quarter of 2005.
We are on track to deliver on our objectives for 2006, said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President. Since the beginning of the year, weve made good progress on our business priorities. Weve advanced a number of initiatives to improve customer service. Weve continued to make investments in our infrastructure and new technology. And weve executed long-term contracts that could lead to one of the largest single infusions of new generation in California in decades. We intend to build on

these efforts throughout the year to strengthen service and ensure a reliable energy future for California.
EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the first quarter were $214 million, or $0.60 per share, compared with $226 million, or $0.56 in the same quarter of 2005.
Earnings from operations exclude certain non-operating income and expenses reported in GAAP net income (see Items Impacting Comparability in the accompanying financial tables, which reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISON
 
Earnings from operations for the first quarter of 2006 were $0.04 per share above levels for the same period in 2005. The quarter-over-quarter difference primarily reflects the effects of share repurchases, which led to fewer shares outstanding in 2006, offset by the reduction in earnings associated with the elimination of the regulatory asset established as part of the resolution of Pacific Gas and Electric Companys Chapter 11 case, in addition to the net effects of other items (see First Quarter 2006 vs. First Quarter 2005 in the accompanying financial tables).
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirmed its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.40-$2.50 per share for 2006 and $2.65-$2.75 per share for 2007.
Guidance assumes that the utility earns its authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent on anticipated rate base for 2006 and 2007, and that earnings are decreased by the impact of the equity carrying cost credit associated with the Rate Reduction Bonds and Energy Recovery Bonds, and the interest expense of PG&E Corporation debt.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or

alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP.
