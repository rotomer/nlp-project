PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, ON TRACK WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR 2006
 
 Second Quarter Reflects Regularly Scheduled Diablo Canyon Refueling
   
   
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $232 million, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter of 2006. In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $267 million, or $0.70 per share.
On a stand-alone basis, PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiarys GAAP results were $227 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $272 million in the same quarter of 2005.
As anticipated, net income for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 reflects the impact of a carrying cost credit. This credit has been provided to customers since November 2005 to compensate them for the pre-funding of future tax liabilities associated with the refinancing of a regulatory asset put in place as part of Pacific Gas and Electric Companys bankruptcy settlement. (see Terms in Press Release below). The cash from the refinancing was utilized to repurchase common stock, partially offsetting the impact on earnings per share.

Expenses associated with a planned refueling outage for Unit 2 of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant also lowered net income for the quarter, but are not expected to have a significant impact on the year. While the utility recovers the costs for scheduled plant maintenance in its rates evenly throughout the year, the costs of the refueling outage occurred in the second quarter. This creates a timing difference between revenues and expenses that will balance out over the year.
Net income for the second quarter was not impacted by the higher market prices of fuel or purchased power. Increases or decreases in these expense categories are generally offset by increases or decreases in revenues authorized for collection by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
Earnings for the second quarter were solid and in line with expectations, said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President. We are on track to deliver on our objectives for 2006, and made significant progress in this past quarter.
Darbee cited a number of successes the company had during the quarter including:

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the second quarter were $228 million, or $0.64 per share, compared with $262 million, or $0.69 in the same quarter of 2005.
Earnings from operations exclude certain non-operating income and expenses reported in GAAP net income (see Items Impacting Comparability in the accompanying financial tables, which reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
 
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirmed its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.40-$2.50 per share for 2006 and $2.65-$2.75 per share for 2007.
Guidance assumes that the utility earns its authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP.
