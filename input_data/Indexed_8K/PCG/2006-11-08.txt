PG&E CORP. RAISES OUTLOOK FOR 2006, REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS, REAFFIRMS GUIDANCE FOR 2007
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $393 million, or $1.09 per share, in the third quarter of 2006. In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $252 million, or $0.65 per share.
On a stand-alone basis, PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiarys GAAP results were $375 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $244 million in the same quarter of 2005.
Strong operational performance, combined with better than anticipated results in several areas, elevated our overall quarterly results to put the company on course to exceed prior expectations for 2006, said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President. Looking ahead to 2007, our outlook remains in line with our previous guidance.
EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the third quarter were $310 million, or $0.86 per share, compared with $239 million, or $0.62 per share, in the same quarter of 2005.
Positive factors affecting quarter-over-quarter operational results include higher gas transmission revenues in 2006, recovery of litigation costs associated with disputed generator claims stemming from the California energy crisis following regulatory review, and lower costs related to utility litigation compared with 2005 (see Earnings per Common Share from Operations, Third Quarter 2006 vs. Third Quarter 2005 in the accompanying financial tables).
This income was partially offset by a carrying cost credit for the quarter that has been provided to customers since November 2005 to compensate them for pre-funding future tax liabilities associated with the refinancing of a regulatory asset put in place to resolve the utilitys Chapter 11 case (see Terms in Press Release below).
Quarter-over-quarter per share amounts were also affected by the positive impact of share repurchases in November 2005, which resulted in fewer shares outstanding for 2006 when compared with 2005.
Earnings from operations for the third quarter were not impacted by the cost of electricity and natural gas provided to customers, or the cost of fuel to generate electricity. Increases or decreases in these expense categories are generally offset by revenue adjustments authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
 
Earnings from operations for the quarter exclude certain income and expenses reported in GAAP net income that reflect events or circumstances considered to be unusual and generally not reflective of ongoing, core operations. For the third quarter, these include the recent regulatory authorization for recovery of costs associated with electric transmission scheduling services dating back to 1998, as well as recovery of interest costs incurred in connection with disputed generator claims stemming from the California energy crisis (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of earnings from operations to consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
 
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
As a result of the positive third quarter and year-to-date results, PG&E Corporation raised its guidance for 2006 by $0.05 per share, to a range of $2.45-$2.55 and expects to finish toward the top end of that range. The company reaffirmed its previous guidance for 2007 earnings from operations in the $2.65-$2.75 per share range. Guidance for 2007 assumes that items that have impacted year-to-date 2006 results, such as gas transmission revenues and the level of litigation expenses, return to historical levels.
Guidance assumes that the utility earns its authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent and, for 2007 guidance, that the proposed settlement agreement to resolve the utilitys 2007 general rate case is approved by the CPUC.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of guidance of earnings from operations to guidance of consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).

Reconciliation of PG&E Corporations Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Net Income in Accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
Third Quarter and Year-to-Date, 2006 vs. 2005
(in millions, except per share amounts)
1.     Earnings from operations exclude items impacting comparability.
2.     Items impacting comparability reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP.
3.     Items impacting comparability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 reflect the recovery of approximately $55 million ($0.15 per common share) and $77 million ($0.21 per common share), after-tax, respectively, of Scheduling Coordinator, or SC, costs, incurred from April 1998 through September 2006, which were determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, to be recoverable through the transmission revenue balancing account, or TRBA.
4.     Items impacting comparability for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 reflect an increase of approximately $18 million ($0.05 per common share), after-tax, in the estimated cost of environmental remediation associated with the Utilitys gas compressor station located near Hinkley, California, as a result of changes in the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards imposed remediation levels.
5.     Items impacting comparability for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 reflect the recovery of approximately $28 million ($0.08 per common share), after-tax, of previously recorded net interest expense on the Power Exchange Corporation, or PX, liability from April 12, 2004 to February 10, 2005, in the Energy Recovery Bond Balancing Account as a result of completion of the verification audit by the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, in the Utility's 2005 annual electric true-up proceeding.
6.     Items impacting comparability for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 include the net effect of incremental interest costs of approximately $3 million ($0.01 per common share), after-tax, incurred by the Utility through February 10, 2005 related to generator disputed claims in the Utility's Chapter 11 proceeding, which were not considered recoverable.
7.     During the third quarter of 2005, PG&E Corporation received additional information from NEGT regarding income to be included in PG&E Corporation's 2004 federal income tax return. This information was incorporated in the 2004 tax return, which was filed with the IRS in September 2005. As a result, the 2004 federal income tax liability was reduced by approximately $19 million. In addition, NEGT provided additional information with respect to amounts previously included in PG&E Corporation's 2003 federal income tax return. This change resulted in PG&E Corporation's 2003 federal income tax liability increasing by approximately $6 million. These two adjustments, netting to $13 million, were recognized in income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2005.
