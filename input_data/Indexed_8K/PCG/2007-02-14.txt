Explanatory Note:
This amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 13, 2007 (Report) is being filed to correct the table that appeared in the Report. The correct version of the table is included below. No other changes were made to the Report. This amendment restates the Report in its entirety.
2007 General Rate Case
On February 13, 2007, a proposed decision was issued by an administrative law judge (ALJ) presiding over Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) 2007 General Rate Case (GRC) pending at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). On the same day, an alternate proposed decision was issued by the assigned CPUC Commissioner in the case. As previously reported, a proposed settlement agreement, reached among the Utility, the CPUCs Division of Ratepayer Advocates (DRA), and other parties, to resolve the issues raised
by these parties and
all revenue requirement-related issues raised in the 2007 GRC, was submitted to the CPUC for approval in August 2006. The ALJs proposed decision differs from the settlement agreement. The alternate proposed decision issued by the assigned Commissioner recommends that the proposed settlement agreement be approved.
Both the proposed decision and the alternate proposed decision accept the settlement agreements proposal to set the Utilitys GRC revenue requirements for a four-year period, 2007-2010. Under this proposal, the Utilitys next GRC would be effective January 1, 2011. On October 19, 2006, the CPUC approved the Utilitys request to make the revenue requirements ultimately adopted by the CPUC effective on January 1, 2007.
Settlement Agreement
The settlement agreement proposes that the Utilitys electric and gas service revenue requirements effective January 1, 2007 be set at approximately $2.9 billion for electric distribution, approximately $1 billion for gas distribution, and $1 billion for electric generation operations, for a total of approximately $4.9 billion. The revenue requirement amounts set forth in the settlement agreement reflect an increase of $222 million in the Utilitys electric distribution revenues, an increase of $20.5 million in gas distribution revenues, and a decrease of $29.8 million in generation operation revenues, for an overall increase of $212.7 million (or 4.5%), over the 2006 authorized amounts. Under the settlement agreement, the Utilitys revenue requirements are $181 million less than the amount requested in the Utilitys original GRC application. Of this amount, approximately $95 million relates to depreciation expense, approximately $29 million relates to return and taxes associated with rate base, approximately $21 million relates to operating and maintenance expenses and customer service expenses, and approximately $36 million relates to administrative and general expenses, payroll taxes, and other miscellaneous expenses.
The settlement agreement also provides for annual attrition adjustments to authorized revenues of $125 million in each of 2008, 2009, and 2010. (Attrition adjustments are annual increases to base revenues in order to avoid a reduction in earnings due to, among other things, inflation and increases in invested capital.) The attrition adjustment to authorized revenues for 2010 would be $125 million, less the one-time additional amount of $35 million from 2009, for a net increase of $90 million in 2010. The attrition adjustments discussed above incorporate some estimated benefits for the Utilitys customers of cost savings attributable to the Utilitys implementation of initiatives to achieve operating and cost efficiencies in 2008, 2009 and 2010. If the actual cost savings exceed these amounts, such benefits would accrue to shareholders. Conversely, if these cost savings are not realized, earnings available for shareholders would be reduced.
Proposed Decision and Alternate Proposed Decision
The ALJs proposed decision would modify the revenue requirements proposed in the settlement agreement in the areas of hydroelectric operations, rate base and the treatment of certain tax issues. The
2
recommended amount would result in a total revenue requirement decrease of approximately $43 million in 2007 relative to the $213 million total increase proposed under the settlement agreement. The attrition adjustments would be consistent with the settlement agreement.
The following table sets forth the amount of the changes to 2006 authorized revenue requirements, by category, that would result from the revenue requirements recommended in the proposed decision and in the alternate proposed decision and the differences between the resulting revenue requirement change:
Final Decision
The CPUC rules of procedure generally require that a proposed decision have been issued at least 30 days before the CPUC can vote on the decision. The next scheduled meeting at which the CPUC could issue a final decision in the 2007 GRC will be held on March 15, 2007.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict when the CPUC will issue a final decision or whether the settlement agreement will be approved.
