PG&E CORP. REPORTS SOLID YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS, RAISES EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR 2007
 
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $991 million, or $2.76 per share, for the full year 2006. This compares with $917 million, or $2.37 per share, for the full year 2005.
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the year were $922 million, or $2.57 per share, compared with $906 million, or $2.34 per share, in 2005. This excludes certain income and expenses reported in GAAP net income that are not considered to be reflective of ongoing, core operations. For 2006, items impacting comparability primarily reflect the authorization for recovery of costs associated with electric transmission scheduling services provided by PG&E Corporations utility subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, dating back to 1998 (see Reconciliation of Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Net Income in Accordance with GAAP in the accompanying financial tables).
We delivered solid financial results in 2006 and will build on this momentum going forward, said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President. Were entering 2007 with a sharp focus on advancing our business transformation strategy, while taking important leadership positions on issues like climate change and the environment. Were at the forefront on these issues, because its consistent with our vision. Its consistent with our values. And it also fits with our overall strategy, which emphasizes operational excellence and taking care of our customers. Im confident that through our efforts, we will continue to deliver for our customers, employees, shareholders and our communities.
The year-over-year increase in earnings per share predominantly reflects the positive effects of share repurchases in 2005, which resulted in fewer shares outstanding in 2006, in addition to the net effects of other items (see Earnings per Common Share from Operations, Year-to-Date 2006 vs. Year-to-Date 2005 in the accompanying financial tables).
Earnings from operations for the year were not impacted by changes in the cost of electricity and natural gas provided to customers, or the cost of fuel to generate electricity. Increases or decreases in these expense categories are generally offset by revenue adjustments authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
On a stand-alone basis in 2006, the utilitys GAAP results were $971 million, compared to $918 million for 2005.
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER RESULTS
For the fourth quarter of 2006, PG&E Corporation reported GAAP net income of $152 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with $180 million, or $0.49 per share, in the same quarter of 2005.
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $170 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with $179 million, or $0.49 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2005 (see Earnings per Common Share from Operations, Fourth Quarter 2006 vs. Fourth Quarter 2005 in the accompanying financial tables).
On a stand-alone basis, the utilitys GAAP results were $155 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $183 million in the same quarter of 2005.
2007 EARNINGS GUIDANCE
PG&E Corporation raised its guidance for 2007 earnings from operations by $0.05 per share, to a range of $2.70-$2.80. Guidance assumes that the utilitys rate base averages $17.3 billion in 2007, that the company earns its authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent, and that the proposed settlement agreement to resolve the utilitys 2007 general rate case is approved by the CPUC.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of guidance of earnings from operations to guidance of consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).

Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date, 2006 vs. 2005
(in millions, except per share amounts)
1.    Earnings from operations exclude items impacting comparability as noted in the following discussion.
2.    Items impacting comparability reconcile earnings from operations with consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP.
3.    During the third quarter of 2005, PG&E Corporation received additional information from its former subsidiary, National Energy & Gas Transmission, Inc, or NEGT, regarding income to be included in PG&E Corporation's 2004 federal
 
income tax return. This information was incorporated in the 2004 tax return, which was filed with the IRS in September 2005. As a result, the 2004 federal income tax
 
liability was reduced by approximately $19 million. NEGT also provided additional information with respect to amounts previously included in PG&E Corporation's
 
2003 federal income tax return. This change resulted in PG&E Corporation's 2003 federal income tax liability increasing by approximately $6 million. These two
adjustments, netting to $13 million, were recognized in income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2005.
