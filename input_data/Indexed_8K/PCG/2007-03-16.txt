Item 8.01 Other Events
2007 General Rate Case
On March 15, 2007, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a multi-party settlement agreement to resolve Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) 2007 General Rate Case (GRC). The decision sets the Utilitys electric and gas service revenue requirements for a four-year period, from 2007 through 2010. Effective January 1, 2007, the Utility is authorized to collect revenue requirements of approximately $2.9 billion for electric distribution (an increase of $222 million over the 2006 authorized amount), approximately $1 billion for gas distribution (an increase of $20.5 million over the 2006 authorized amount), and approximately $1 billion for electric generation operations (a decrease of $29.8 million from the 2006 authorized amount). The total authorized amount of approximately $4.9 billion reflects an overall increase of $212.7 million (or 4.5%) over the total 2006 authorized amount.
The decision also authorizes annual increases, known as attrition adjustments, to the authorized revenue requirements in order to avoid a reduction in earnings due to, among other things, inflation and increases in invested capital. The decision authorizes attrition adjustments to authorized revenues of $125 million in each of 2008, 2009, and 2010. The decision also authorizes an additional adjustment of $35 million in 2009 for the cost of a second refueling outage at the Utilitys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
Under the decision, the Utilitys next GRC will be effective January 1, 2011.
Proposed Gas Accord IV Settlement Agreement
On March 15, 2007, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC to request approval of a settlement agreement, known as the Gas Accord IV, to establish the Utilitys natural gas transmission and storage rates and associated revenue requirements and to retain t
he Gas Accord market structure
for the period 2008-2010. For more information about the proposed Gas Accord IV, see PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2007.
It is expected that the CPUC will issue a final decision with respect to the Gas Accord IV by the end of the year.
If the CPUC does not issue a final decision by the end of the year to approve new rates effective January 1, 2008, the rates and terms and conditions of service in effect as of December 31, 2007, will remain in effect, with an automatic 2% escalation in the rates as of January 1, 2008.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether or when the CPUC will approve the proposed Gas Accord IV.
