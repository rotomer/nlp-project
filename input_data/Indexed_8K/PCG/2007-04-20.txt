PG&E Corporation also has adopted an Officer Severance Policy that covers officers of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. These plans, as well as perquisites provided to officers, are described in PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys 2007 joint proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
Mr. Powell does not have any relationship or related transaction with PG&E Corporation or the Utility that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.

Subject to Section 603 of the California Corporations Code, any action which, under any provision of the California Corporations Code, may be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Shareholder Action by Written Consent.
Any party seeking to solicit written consent from shareholders to take corporate action must deliver a notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation which requests the Board of Directors to set a record date for determining shareholders entitled to give such consent.  Such written request must set forth as to each matter the party proposes for shareholder action by written consents (a) a brief description of the matter and (b) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the requesting party.  Within ten days of receiving the request in the proper form, the Board shall set a record date for the taking of such action by written consent in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 701 and Article IV, Section 1 of these Bylaws.  If the Board fails to set a record date within such ten-day period, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to give the written consent for the matters specified in the notice shall be the day on which the first written consent is given in accordance with California Corporations Code Section 701.
Each written consent delivered to the Corporation must set forth (a) the action sought to be taken, (b) the name and address of the shareholder as they appear on the Corporations books, (c) the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are beneficially owned by the shareholder, (d) the name and address of the proxyholder authorized by the shareholder to give such written consent, if applicable, and (d) any material interest of the shareholder or proxyholder in the action sought to be taken.

Consents may be revoked by written notice (i) to the Corporation, (ii) to the shareholder or shareholders soliciting consents or soliciting revocations in opposition to action by consent proposed by the Corporation (the Soliciting Shareholders), or (iii) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the Corporation or the Soliciting Shareholders.
Within three business days after receipt of the earliest dated consent solicited by the Soliciting Shareholders and delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided in California Corporations Code Section 603 or the determination by the Board of Directors of the Corporation that the Corporation should seek corporate action by written consent, as the case may be, the Corporate Secretary shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing a

ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations.  The cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.
Consents and revocations shall be delivered to the inspectors upon receipt by the Corporation, the Soliciting Shareholders or their proxy solicitors, or other designated agents.  As soon as consents and revocations are received, the inspectors shall review the consents and revocations and shall maintain a count of the number of valid and unrevoked consents.  The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to the Corporation, the Soliciting Shareholder or their representatives, or any other entity.  As soon as practicable after the earlier of (i) sixty days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided in California Corporations Code Section 603, or (ii) a written request therefor by the Corporation or the Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting consents), notice of which request shall be given to the party opposing the solicitation of consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents to authorize or take the action specified in the consents has been received in accordance with these Bylaws, the inspectors shall issue a preliminary report to the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders stating:  (a) the number of valid consents, (b) the number of valid revocations, (c) the number of valid and unrevoked consents, (d) the number of invalid consents, (e) the number of invalid revocations, and (f) whether, based on their preliminary count, the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents has been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents.
Unless the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders shall have forty-eight hours to review the consents and revocations and to advise the inspectors and the opposing party in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the preliminary report of the inspectors.  If no written notice of an intention to challenge the preliminary report is received within forty-eight hours after the inspectors issuance of the preliminary report, the inspectors shall issue to the Corporation and the Soliciting Shareholders their final report containing the information from the inspectors determination with respect to whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize and take the action specified in the consents.  If the Corporation or the Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice of an intention to challenge the inspectors preliminary report within forty-eight hours after the issuance of that report, a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable.  A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter.  Following completion of the challenge session, the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue their final report to the Soliciting Shareholders and the Corporation, which report shall contain the information included in the preliminary report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and a certification of whether the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents was obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents.  A copy of the final report of the inspectors shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.
