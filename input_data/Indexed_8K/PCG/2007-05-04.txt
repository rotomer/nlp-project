Item 8.01.  Other Events
 
Energy Efficiency Rulemaking
On May 3, 2007, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) filed testimony with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in the energy efficiency rulemaking proceeding in response to the assigned commissioners March 26, 2007 order to re-open the record and hold evidentiary hearings on limited issues.  The March 26, 2007 order reversed a previous ruling to close the record.  The evidentiary hearings will primarily address the appropriate benchmark and methodologies to be used in establishing incentive mechanisms to reward or penalize the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) depending on the extent to which the IOUs successfully implement their 2006-2008 energy efficiency programs and meet the CPUCs targets for reducing customers demand for electricity and natural gas.  In a new development, a new party, the California Large Energy Consumers Association representing industrial customers, filed testimony supporting the proposal of a party representing small consumers, The Utility Reform Network (TURN).
Under the incentive mechanisms proposed by the IOUs, the benchmark to establish the level of potential incentive earnings would be supply-side comparability, i.e., a level of incentives based on the earnings that could be expected from investment in new power and transmission projects.  Under the Utilitys proposed incentive mechanism, if the Utility achieved 80% to 100% of the CPUCs demand reduction targets, 80% of the net present value of energy efficiency programs (i.e., the net benefits) would accrue to customers and 20% of the net benefits would accrue to shareholders.  If the Utility achieves savings in excess of 100% of the CPUCs targets, the Utilitys shareholders would receive 30% of the additional net benefits attributable to the portion of demand reduction that exceeds 100% of the CPUCs targets and the Utilitys customers would receive the remaining 70%. The Utility would not receive any additional incentive earnings for achieving more than 110% of the CPUCs target.  Under this proposal, if the Utility achieved savings at 80% of the CPUCs targets, the cumulative amount of potential pre-tax incentive earnings covering the three-year period would be approximately $141.2 million.  If the Utility achieved savings at 100% of the CPUCs targets, the cumulative amount of potential pre-tax incentive earnings covering the three-year period would be approximately $222.5 million.  If the Utility achieved savings at 110% or more of the CPUCs targets, the cumulative amount of potential pre-tax incentive earnings covering the three-year period would be a maximum of approximately $283.4 million.
Other parties have proposed that the IOUs begin earning incentives only when an IOU achieves between 85% and 100% of the CPUCs energy savings targets set for that IOU.  Under the non-IOU proposals, incentive earnings range from only 1.5% to 6% of the net benefits, if the IOUs achieved 100% of their savings target.  Of the various proposals submitted, TURN proposes a mechanism that would result in the lowest earnings. TURN proposes that the IOUs receive 2% of the net benefits only if they achieved 100% of their savings target.  The IOUs would not receive any rewards for achieving savings below 100% of the target.  Under TURNs proposal, if the Utility achieves 100% of the CPUCs savings targets, the Utility would receive $21 million in cumulative pre-tax incentive earnings covering the three-year period.  TURN would allow the IOUs to retain 2.5% of the net benefits if they achieved 120% of their target.
All parties have proposed penalties for poor performance in achieving the CPUCs targets.  The Utility has proposed that if it achieves less than 40% of the CPUCs targets, the Utility would provide customers any shortfall between the revenues received in rates for energy efficiency and benefits obtained through the energy efficiency programs.  Other parties have proposed that penalties be imposed if the IOUs achieve less than 50% to less than 85% of the CPUCs targets.  TURN has proposed that penalties would be incurred if the IOUs failed to achieve 85% of the CPUCs targets.
Depending upon the ratemaking method adopted by the CPUC, actual shareholder incentives or penalties may not be realized for several years.  The Utility has proposed a process for earnings assessments and progress payments whereby 75% of earnings payments would be made in 2008 (for 2006 program activities), 75% in 2009 (for 2007 program activities) and 75% in 2010 (for 2008 program activities), with a final true-up relating to the remainder of payments that would also begin in 2010.
It is anticipated that the CPUC will issue a final decision on the adoption of a shareholder incentive and penalty mechanism in the second half of 2007.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict what incentive mechanism the CPUC may ultimately adopt and what impact the adopted mechanism may have on their financial condition and results of operations.
