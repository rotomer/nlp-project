PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS
 
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $256 million, or $0.71 per share, in the first quarter of 2007.  In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $214 million, or $0.60 per share.
"We had a strong operational and financial first quarter," said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President.  "We are grateful to the 20,000 men and women of PG&E for the tremendous effort they are making to transform the company into the nation's leading energy utility."  Darbee noted that as part of this effort, business customers ranked PG&E among the highest in the nation in terms of the company's ability to deliver superior service.  Darbee also noted that a key element of its customer satisfaction initiative is how the company procures and generates electricity.  "Our objective is to secure 20 percent of all customer electricity needs through renewable resources by 2010.  Additionally, our customers are some of the most efficient users of electricity and natural gas in the nation, and we continue to develop leading edge customer energy efficiency and demand-side management programs to help 15 million Californians maintain their lead in the efficient and wise use of energy."
                         
               
               
 
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISON
Earnings from operations for the first quarter of 2007 were $0.11 per share above levels for the same period in 2006.  The quarter-over-quarter difference primarily reflects higher authorized revenues associated with higher investment in infrastructure to improve reliability and customer service.  Earnings per share also reflect the difference in storm-related spending, which was higher in the first quarter of 2006 when compared to the first quarter of 2007 (see Earnings per Common Share from Operations, First Quarter 2007 vs. First Quarter 2006 in the accompanying financial tables).
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 PG&E Corporation reaffirmed its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.70-$2.80 per share for 2007 and $2.90-$3.00 per share for 2008.
   
 Guidance assumes that the utilitys rate base averages $17 billion in 2007 and $18.7 billion for 2008, that the company earns its authorized return on equity, and that the ratemaking capital structure is maintained at 52 percent equity.
   
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of guidance of earnings from operations to guidance of consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).  There were no differences between earnings from operations and consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP for the three month periods ended March 31, 2007 or 2006.
