PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS SOLID SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
(San Francisco) -- PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $269 million, or $0.74 per share, in the second quarter of 2007.  In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $232 million, or $0.65 per share.
"We are on track to achieve our 2007 expectations," said Peter A. Darbee, PG&E Corporation Chairman and CEO.  Darbee also noted, "Weve entered into several contracts with solar and wind providers that will help us achieve our 20 percent renewable portfolio standard requirement. And, with the launch of our ClimateSmart program, our customers, who historically are some of the most efficient users of electricity and natural gas in the nation, now have the option to reduce the carbon footprint associated with their energy use.  Additionally, we will continue to focus on and invest heavily in infrastructure improvements to provide our customers with safe, reliable service.
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISON
 
Earnings from operations for the second quarter of 2007 were $0.10 per share above levels for the same period in 2006.  The quarter-over-quarter difference primarily reflects earnings on a higher capital investment, consistent with early 2007 regulatory approvals of
 
 
Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2007 General Rate Case and the most recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) transmission case.
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirmed its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.70-$2.80 per share for 2007 and $2.90-$3.00 per share for 2008.
Guidance assumes that the utility earns at least its authorized return on equity while growing its asset base and controlling its costs in line with regulatory approvals, and that the ratemaking capital structure is maintained at 52 percent equity.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of guidance of earnings from operations to guidance of consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).  There was no difference between earnings from operations and consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP for the three month period ended June 30, 2007.  In 2006, consolidated net income was $232 million, or $0.65 per share on a GAAP basis, versus $228 million, or $0.64 per share on an earnings from operations basis.
