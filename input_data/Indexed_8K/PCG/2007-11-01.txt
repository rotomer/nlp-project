(San Francisco)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE:PCG) consolidated net income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $278 million, or $0.77 cents per share, in the third quarter of 2007, compared with $393 million, or $1.09 per share, in the same quarter of 2006. On a non-GAAP, earnings from operations basis, PG&E Corporations results in the third quarter were $0.77 cents per share. Earnings from operations in the third quarter of 2006 were $0.86 cents per share.
The year-over-year difference in earnings primarily reflects a number of non-recurring items that raised results in the 2006 third quarter, including the recovery of costs incurred for electric transmission scheduling services, the recovery of interest and litigation costs for disputed generator claims, and the utilization of a tax benefit for capital loss carry forwards. There were no comparable items in the third quarter of 2007.
Our results in the third quarter keep us on track to meet our 2007 earnings expectations in the upper half of our guidance range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation.
                                                 
We also continue to make progress on our renewable energy initiatives. We signed new contracts for solar thermal and wind energy resources in the quarter, moving us further toward the 2010 renewable portfolio energy goal, and we stepped up our efforts to begin receiving the first deliveries of renewable bio-gas in California beginning in 2008, Darbee said.
Our ongoing challenge is to continuously improve service to our customers amid the pressure of rising costs, which has been and continues to be the focus of our business transformation efforts, Darbee added.
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
PG&E Corporations guidance for 2007 earnings from operations is now specified in the upper half of the $2.70-$2.80 per share range and for 2008 is reaffirmed at $2.90-$3.00 per share.
Guidance assumes that the utility earns at least its authorized return on equity while growing its asset base and controlling its costs in line with regulatory approvals, and that the ratemaking capital structure is maintained at 52 percent equity.
PG&E Corporation discloses historical results and bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of earnings from operations - historical results and EPS guidance - to consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
