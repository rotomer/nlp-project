2008 Cost of Capital Proceeding
On November 6, 2007, a proposed decision was issued in Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) 2008 cost of capital proceeding pending at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  The proposed decision recommends maintaining the Utilitys currently authorized capital structure and an 11.35% rate of return on equity (ROE) on the Utilitys electricity and natural gas distribution and electric generation rate base.  The table below shows the proposed decisions recommendations compared to the Utilitys request:
The recommended cost of capital would not have a material impact on the Utilitys 2008 revenue requirement.  The proposed decision recommends that the changes to the Utilitys revenue requirement be effective January 1, 2008.
PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will adopt the proposed decision.
The proposed decision recommends deferring the requirement for the utilities to file their annual cost of capital applications scheduled to be filed on May 8, 2008, noting that the proceeding remains open for the CPUC to consider mechanisms that could replace the annual cost of capital proceedings.  A final decision on that phase of the proceeding has been previously scheduled to be issued by April 24, 2008.
