(San Francisco)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE:PCG) consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2007, reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $1,006 million, or $2.78 per share, compared with $991 million, or $2.76 per share, in 2006.
For the fourth quarter of 2007, PG&E Corporations consolidated net income was $203 million, or $0.56 cents per share, compared with $152 million, or $0.43 per share, in the same quarter of 2006.  On a non-GAAP earnings from operations basis, PG&E Corporations results in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $0.56 per share, compared with $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The quarter-over-quarter difference in earnings from operations primarily reflects earnings on a higher capital investment in the Utilitys energy infrastructure, consistent with regulatory approvals.
On a year-to-year basis, the difference between 2006 and 2007 net income did not fully reflect the earnings on higher capital investment because certain events that increased 2006 net income did not recur in 2007. For 2006, these items impacting comparability primarily reflect the authorized recovery of costs associated with electric transmission scheduling services provided by the Utility dating back to 1998 (see Reconciliation of Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Net Income in Accordance with GAAP in the accompanying financial tables).  There were no items impacting comparability during 2007; earnings from operations and GAAP earnings were the same.
PG&E Corporation delivered solid 2007 earnings in the upper half of our guidance range, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation.  In 2008 we will continue to focus our attention on infrastructure investment and providing our customers with clean and reliable power, safely and cost effectively.
We will also continue to exert a leadership role to address climate change. We believe that our leadership in this area is not only the right thing to do, but also what our customers, regulators and policymakers want us to do. Therefore, it is in the best interest of our shareholders, Darbee added.
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirms guidance for 2008 earnings from operations in the $2.90 to $3.00 per share range and reaffirms guidance for 2009 earnings from operations in the $3.15 to $3.25 per share range.
Guidance assumes that the Utility earns at least its authorized return on equity while growing its asset base and controlling its costs in line with regulatory approvals, and that the ratemaking capital structure is maintained at 52 percent equity.
PG&E Corporation discloses historical results and bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the
underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of earnings from operations to consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP- historical results and EPS guidance)
COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS
 
PG&E Corporation is raising its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.39 per share from $0.36 per share, beginning with the first quarter 2008 dividend.  The dividend is payable on April 15, 2008, to shareholders of record on March 31, 2008.
We intend to consider further increases in the common stock dividend when justified by further growth in earnings, Darbee said.
In addition, the Utility declared dividends on all outstanding series of its preferred stock for the three months ending April 30, 2008.  The dividends will be payable on May 15, 2008, to shareholders of record on April 30, 2008.
In order to be considered a shareholder of record for the common and preferred dividend payments, you must have purchased the stock at least three trading days before the applicable record date.
The Utility will pay dividends on its eight series of preferred stock as follows:
