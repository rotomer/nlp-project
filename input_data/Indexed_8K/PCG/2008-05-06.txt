(San Francisco)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $224 million, or $0.62 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.  These results primarily reflect increased expenses to respond to the January winter storms and the scheduled refueling outage at Diablo Canyon Power Plant Unit 2 as compared to the same period last year, when consolidated net income was $256 million, or $0.71 per share.
 "We are on track to deliver on our guidance for the year," said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation. "We are proud of our teams performance during the first three months of the year in connection with the recovery efforts from Northern Californias worst winter storm in more than a decade and  the completion of the refueling outage and steam generator replacement project at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant Unit 2."
 
 
 
 
 
EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirms its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.90-$3.00 per share for 2008 and reaffirms guidance for 2009 earnings from operations in the $3.15-$3.25 per-share range.
Guidance assumes that PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiary maintains a ratemaking capital structure of 52 percent equity and an authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent while growing its asset base, earning incentive revenues for energy efficiency achievements, and realizing operational efficiencies.
PG&E Corporation bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of guidance based on earnings from operations to guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP). There were no differences between earnings from operations and consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP for the three month periods ended March 31, 2008 or 2007.
