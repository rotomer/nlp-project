(San Francisco)  PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) consolidated net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $293 million, or $0.80 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. In the same period last year, consolidated net income was $269 million, or $0.74 cents per share.
With our second quarter results, we remain on track to deliver on the Corporations financial targets for 2008, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation. We also continue to advance plans for additional investments in projects to strengthen reliability and ensure adequate future energy supplies.
QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISON
 
Earnings from operations for the second quarter of 2008 were $0.06 cents per share above those for the same period for 2007. The quarter-over-quarter difference primarily reflects earnings on a higher authorized capital investment in utility subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Companys infrastructure.

EARNINGS GUIDANCE
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirms its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $2.90-$3.00 per share for 2008 and reaffirms guidance for 2009 earnings from operations in the range of $3.15-$3.25 per share.
Guidance assumes that PG&E Corporations Pacific Gas and Electric Company subsidiary maintains a ratemaking capital structure of 52 percent equity, that it earns at least its combined CPUC- and FERC- authorized return on equity of 11.45% while growing its asset base in line with its forecast, that it earns sufficient incentive revenues for energy efficiency achievements, that the CPUC approves additional capital investment projects proposed by the Utility, and that the Utility realizes additional sustainable operational and cost efficiencies.
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP). There were no differences between earnings from operations and consolidated net income as reported in accordance with GAAP for the three month periods ended June 30, 2008 or 2007.
