Section 104.
Acts of Holders.
     (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
     (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Senior Notes held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Senior Note shall bind every future Holder of the same Senior Note and the Holder of every Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Senior Note.
     (e) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and the authority of the Person executing the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
     (f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Senior Notes of any series any Act, the Company may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Senior Notes entitled to take such Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such Act may be sought or given before or after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Senior Notes for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Senior Notes of such series Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act, and for that purpose the Senior Notes of such series Outstanding shall be computed as of such record date.
Section 105.
Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
          (1) the Trustee by any Holder of a Senior Note or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Trust and Securities Services, or transmitted by facsimile transmission or other direct written electronic means to such telephone number or other electronic communications address as the Trustee shall from time to time designate, or
 
transmitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight courier guaranteeing next day delivery, charges prepaid, to the Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office,
          (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and transmitted by facsimile transmission or other direct written electronic means to such telephone number or other electronic communications address as the Company shall from time to time designate, or transmitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight courier guaranteeing next day delivery, charges prepaid, to the Company, addressed to the attention of its Secretary, at One Market, Spear Tower, Suite 2400, San Francisco, CA 94105, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.
Section 106.
Notice to Holders of Senior Notes; Waiver.
     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Senior Notes of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such Notice.
     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Senior Notes shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Section 107.
Conflict With Trust Indenture Act.
     If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required to be a part of and govern this Indenture, such required provision shall control.

Section 110.

     In case any provision in this Indenture or the Senior Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Section 111.
Benefits of Indenture.
     Nothing in this Indenture or the Senior Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, their successors hereunder and the Holders of Senior Notes any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

Section 113.

     In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Senior Note shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Senior Notes) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.

          (3) If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to Senior Notes issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for individual Senior Notes of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and, upon receipt of a Company Request for the authentication and delivery of individual Senior Notes of such series in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver (A) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Senior Note or Notes of the same series of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (B) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes delivered to Holders thereof.
          (4) In any exchange provided for in any of the preceding three paragraphs, the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver individual Senior Notes in definitive form in authorized denominations. Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of a Global Security for individual Senior Notes, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, Senior Notes issued in exchange for a
 
Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Provided that the Company has so directed in writing, the Trustee shall deliver such Senior Notes to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes are registered.
          (5) Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding Senior Notes represented thereby shall be made in such manner and by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered pursuant to Section 302 with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 302, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any such Global Security in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 302 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to such Global Security shall be in writing but need not be accompanied by or contained in an Officer's Certificate and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.

Section 302.
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Senior Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by any two of the following: the President, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer. The corporate seal of the Company may be affixed thereto or reproduced thereon and attested by any Authorized Officer, the Secretary of the Company or any Assistant Secretary of the Company. The signature of any of these officers on the Senior Notes may be manual or facsimile.
 
     Senior Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time relevant to the authorization thereof the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Senior Notes.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Senior Notes of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes, and the Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Senior Notes. If all of the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Senior Notes and determining the terms of particular Senior Notes of such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating Senior Notes hereunder, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Senior Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
          (1) an Opinion of Counsel, to the effect that the form and terms of such Senior Notes or the manner of determining such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
          (2) an Officer's Certificate stating, to the knowledge of the signer of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect to any of the Senior Notes shall have occurred and be continuing.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Senior Notes if the issue of such Senior Notes pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Senior Notes and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     If all the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officer's Certificate at the time of issuance of each such Senior Note, but such opinion and certificate shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Senior Note of such series to be issued.
     Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Senior Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Senior Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Senior Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Senior Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Section 303.
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Security Registrar designated pursuant to this Section 303 or Section 1002 a register (referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Senior Notes and of transfers of Senior Notes. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Security Registrar for the purpose of registering Senior Notes and transfers of Senior Notes as herein provided.
     Subject to Section 203, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Senior Note of any series at the office or agency maintained for such purpose for such series, the Company shall execute, and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
     Subject to Section 203, Senior Notes of any series may be exchanged, at the option of the Holder, for Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Senior Notes to be exchanged at any such office or agency.
     Whenever any Senior Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Senior Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Senior Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Senior Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Senior Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 907 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange Senior Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the serial numbers of the Senior Notes of that series called for redemption, or (ii) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Senior Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Senior Note being redeemed in part.
 
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 304.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Senior Notes.
     If any mutilated Senior Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Senior Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Senior Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note, a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Senior Note, pay such Senior Note.
     Upon the issuance of any new Senior Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Senior Note of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Senior Note shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Senior Notes of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes.
Section 305.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Senior Notes, interest on any Senior Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
     Any interest on any Senior Note of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
          (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Senior Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Senior Notes of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
          (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Senior Notes of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, and after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause that such manner of payment has been deemed practicable by the Company.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Senior Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Senior Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Senior Note.
 
Section 306.
Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Senior Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Senior Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Senior Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Senior Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 307.
Cancellation.
     All Senior Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Senior Notes so delivered shall be canceled by the Trustee. No Senior Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Senior Notes canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Senior Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with a Company Order and the Trustee shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company.
Section 308.
Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Senior Notes of any series, interest on the Senior Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Section 401.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Senior Notes.
     Any Senior Note or Senior Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, shall be deemed to have been paid and no longer Outstanding for all purposes of this Indenture, and the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall be satisfied and discharged, if there shall have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust:
     (a) money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or
     (b) in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys
 
which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or
     (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Senior Notes or portions thereof; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for payment or redemption of less than all the Senior Notes of any series, such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Security Registrar as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:
     (x) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes, a Company Order stating that the money and Eligible Obligations deposited in accordance with this Section shall be held in trust, as provided in Section 403;
     (y) if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing or a firm of independent public accountants of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the other requirements set forth in clause (b) or (c) above have been satisfied; and
     (z) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes, an Officer's Certificate stating the Company's intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section.

In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Senior Notes or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officer's Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefits of this Indenture (other than with respect to such deposit) or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article X (except the covenants contained in Sections 1002 and 1003) or any other covenants made in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 301, but the indebtedness of the Company in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such Senior Notes or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
     If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Senior Notes of any series is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Security Registrar shall select such Senior Notes, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 1103 for selection for redemption of less than all the Senior Notes of a series .
     In the event that Senior Notes which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Company's indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section, do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the 60-day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Senior Notes, to the Holders of such Senior Notes to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof.
     Notwithstanding that any Senior Notes shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Senior Notes under Sections 303, 304, 603, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article Four shall survive.
     The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit.
     Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Senior Note would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, such Senior Note shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Senior Note shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect of any Senior Notes shall be subject to the provisions of Section 403.
Section 402.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes herein expressly provided for) and the Trustee, at the expense and request of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
          (1) no Senior Notes remain Outstanding hereunder;
          (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
 
          (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with;
provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 401, any Senior Note previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.
     In the event there are Senior Notes of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so by the Company with respect to Senior Notes of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all Trustees hereunder.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Senior Notes under Sections 303, 304, 603, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article Four shall survive.
Section 403.
Application of Trust Money.
     Neither the Eligible Obligations nor the money deposited pursuant to Section 401, nor the principal or interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations, shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Senior Notes or portions of principal amount thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject, however, to the provisions of Section 1003; provided, however, that any cash received from such principal or interest payments on such Eligible Obligations, if not then needed for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon Company Request and delivery to the Trustee of the documents referred to in subclause (y) of clause (c) in Section 401, be invested pursuant to a Company Order in Eligible Obligations of the type described in clause (b) in Section 401 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient, together with any other moneys and the proceeds of any other Eligible Obligations then held by the Trustee, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Senior Notes or portions thereof on and prior to the Maturity thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestment shall be paid over to the Company as received; and provided, further, that any moneys held in accordance with this Section on the Maturity of all such Senior Notes in excess of the amount required to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due on such Senior Notes shall be paid over to the Company.
 
Section 501.
Events of Default.
     "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Senior Notes of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
          (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Senior Note of that series when it becomes due and payable on an Interest Payment Date other than at Maturity and continuance of such default for a period of thirty (30) days; or

          (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Senior Note of that series and continuance of such default for a period of three Business Days; or
          (4) default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Senior Notes other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee, or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
          (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more Persons other than the Company seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Company or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
          (6) the commencement by the Company of a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or
 
state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; or
          (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Senior Notes of that series in the supplemental indenture authorizing such series.
Section 502.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the
     Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series may declare the principal amount (or such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Senior Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Senior Notes of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
          (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
               (A) all overdue interest on all Senior Notes of that series,
               (B) the principal of (and premium, if any) any Senior Notes of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes,
               (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and
               (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607; and
          (2) all Events of Default with respect to Senior Notes of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Senior Notes of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 503.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if an Event of Default occurs under Section 501(1), (2) or (3) with respect to any Senior Notes the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Senior Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Senior Notes of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 504.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Senior Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
          (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Senior Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of Senior Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
          (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Senior Notes to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Senior Notes, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Senior Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Senior Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Senior Note in any such proceeding.
Section 505.
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Senior Notes.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Senior Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Senior Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name or as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 506.
Application of Money Collected.
     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Senior Notes, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and
     Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Senior Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and
     Third: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto.
Section 507.
Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of any Senior Note of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
 
          (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes of that series;
          (2) the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
          (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
          (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
          (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
Section 508.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Senior Notes shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note on the due dates expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 509.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee or any Holder of a Senior Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Notes shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 510.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes in the last paragraph of Section 304, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent
 
permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 511.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Senior Note to exercise any right or remedy upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Senior Notes.
Section 512.
Control by Holders of Senior Notes.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Senior Notes of such series, provided that
          (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where reasonable indemnity would not be adequate, and
          (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
Section 513.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Senior Notes of such series, waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
          (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of such series, or
          (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Senior Note of such series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 514.
Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Senior Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Senior Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
Section 515.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 601.

          (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may, with respect to Senior Notes of such series, conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
 
     (b) In case an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise, with respect to Senior Notes of such series, such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that
          (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
          (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

          (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 602.
Notice of Defaults.
     Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Senior Notes of any series about which the Trustee shall have knowledge as set forth in Section 603(h) hereof, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Senior Notes of such series entitled to receive reports pursuant to Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act, notice of all defaults hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with respect to Senior Notes of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Senior Notes of such series; and provided, further, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with
 
respect to Senior Notes of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of such series.

     (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series.
 
     (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Senior Notes of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
     (d) If at any time:
          (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a Holder of a Senior Note for at least six months, or
          (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or

then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Senior Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of such series of Senior Notes as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register.
Section 611.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
     (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Senior Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Senior Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Senior Notes.
Section 613.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act:

     (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.
Section 614.
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     At any time when any of the Senior Notes remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Senior Notes that shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Senior Notes of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 304, and Senior Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever
 
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Senior Notes by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Senior Notes, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
     The provisions of Sections 306, 604 and 605 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
 
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Senior Notes of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Senior Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Senior Notes, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Notes of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Senior Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper of general circulation in New York City notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

          In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
          Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
     (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Junior Subordinated Notes held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Junior Subordinated Note shall bind every future Holder of the same Junior Subordinated Note and the Holder of every Junior Subordinated Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Junior Subordinated Note.
     (e) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and the authority of the Person executing the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
     (f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series any Act, the Company may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes entitled to take such Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such Act may be sought or given before or
 
after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act, and for that purpose the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series Outstanding shall be computed as of such record date.
Section 105.
Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.
          Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
          (1) the Trustee by any Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trustee Administration Department, or transmitted by facsimile transmission or other direct written electronic means to such telephone number or other electronic communications address as the Trustee shall from time to time designate, or transmitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or overnight courier guaranteeing next day delivery, charges prepaid, to the Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office,

Section 106.
Notice to Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes; Waiver.
          Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such Notice.
          In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
          Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Junior
 
Subordinated Notes shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
Section 107.

Section 111.

Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (A) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Junior Subordinated Note or Notes of the same series of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (B) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in an authorized denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Junior Subordinated Notes delivered to Holders thereof.

Section 302.
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Junior Subordinated Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by any two of the following: the President, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer. The corporate seal of the Company may be affixed thereto or reproduced thereon and attested by any Authorized Officer, the Secretary of the Company or any Assistant Secretary of the Company. The signature of any of these officers on the Junior Subordinated Notes may be manual or facsimile.
     Junior Subordinated Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time relevant to the authorization thereof the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Junior Subordinated Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Junior Subordinated Notes of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Junior Subordinated Notes. If all of the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Junior Subordinated Notes and determining the terms of particular Junior Subordinated Notes of such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating Junior Subordinated Notes hereunder, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Junior Subordinated Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
          (1) an Opinion of Counsel, to the effect that the form and terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes or the manner of determining such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
          (2) an Officer's Certificate stating, to the knowledge of the signer of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect to any of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall have occurred and be continuing.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Junior Subordinated Notes if the issue of such Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Junior Subordinated Notes and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     If all the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officer's Certificate at the time of issuance of each such Junior Subordinated Note, but such opinion and certificate shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Junior Subordinated Note of such series to be issued.
     Each Junior Subordinated Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Junior Subordinated Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Junior Subordinated Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Junior Subordinated Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Junior Subordinated Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 303.
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Security Registrar designated pursuant to this Section 303 or Section 1002 a register (referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Junior Subordinated Notes and of transfers of Junior Subordinated Notes. The
 
Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Security Registrar for the purpose of registering Junior Subordinated Notes and transfers of Junior Subordinated Notes as herein provided.
     Subject to Section 203, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Junior Subordinated Note of any series at the office or agency maintained for such purpose for such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Junior Subordinated Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
     Subject to Section 203, Junior Subordinated Notes of any series may be exchanged, at the option of the Holder, for Junior Subordinated Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Junior Subordinated Notes to be exchanged at any such office or agency.
     Whenever any Junior Subordinated Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Junior Subordinated Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Junior Subordinated Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Junior Subordinated Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Junior Subordinated Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Junior Subordinated Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Junior Subordinated Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Junior Subordinated Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 907 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange Junior Subordinated Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the serial numbers of the Junior Subordinated Notes of that series called for redemption, or (ii) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Junior Subordinated Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Junior Subordinated Note being redeemed in part.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
 
Section 304.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Junior Subordinated Notes.
     If any mutilated Junior Subordinated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Junior Subordinated Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Junior Subordinated Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Junior Subordinated Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Note, a new Junior Subordinated Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Junior Subordinated Note, pay such Junior Subordinated Note.
     Upon the issuance of any new Junior Subordinated Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Junior Subordinated Note of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Junior Subordinated Note shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Junior Subordinated Notes of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Notes.
Section 305.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Junior Subordinated Notes, interest (including Additional Interest) on any Junior Subordinated Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Junior Subordinated Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
     Any interest (including Additional Interest) on any Junior Subordinated Note of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
          (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Junior Subordinated Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
          (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Junior Subordinated Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Junior Subordinated Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Junior Subordinated Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued (including Additional Interest, if any) and unpaid, and to accrue (including Additional Interest, if any), which were carried by such other Junior Subordinated Note.
 
Section 306.
Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Junior Subordinated Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Junior Subordinated Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on such Junior Subordinated Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Junior Subordinated Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 307.
Cancellation.
     All Junior Subordinated Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Junior Subordinated Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Junior Subordinated Notes so delivered shall be canceled by the Trustee. No Junior Subordinated Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Junior Subordinated Notes canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Junior Subordinated Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with a Company Order and the Trustee shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company.
Section 308.
Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
     Section 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Junior Subordinated Notes.
     Any Junior Subordinated Note or Junior Subordinated Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, shall be deemed to have been paid and no longer Outstanding for all purposes of this Indenture, and the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall be satisfied and discharged, if there shall have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust:
     (a) money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or
     (b) in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and
 
the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or
     (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for payment or redemption of less than all the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Security Registrar as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:
     (x) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Junior Subordinated Notes, a Company Order stating that the money and Eligible Obligations deposited in accordance with this Section shall be held in trust, as provided in Section 403;
     (y) if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing or a firm of independent public accountants of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the other requirements set forth in clause (b) above have been satisfied; and
     (z) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Junior Subordinated Notes, an Officer's Certificate stating the Company's intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section.
     Upon the deposit of money or Eligible Obligations, or both, in accordance with this Section, together with the documents required by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, the Trustee shall, upon Company Request, acknowledge in writing that such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture and that the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof has been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officer's Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefits of this Indenture (other than with respect to such deposit) or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article X (except the covenants contained in Sections 1002 and 1003) or any other covenants made in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 301, but the indebtedness of the Company in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall
 
acknowledge in writing that such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture.
     If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Security Registrar shall select such Junior Subordinated Notes, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 1103 for selection for redemption of less than all the Junior Subordinated Notes of a series .
     In the event that Junior Subordinated Notes which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Company's indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section, do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the 60-day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Junior Subordinated Notes, to the Holders of such Junior Subordinated Notes to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof.
     Notwithstanding that any Junior Subordinated Notes shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes under Sections 303, 304, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article shall survive.
     The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit.
     Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Junior Subordinated Note would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, such Junior Subordinated Note shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Junior Subordinated Note shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect of any Junior Subordinated Notes shall be subject to the provisions of Section 403.
Section 402.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Junior Subordinated Notes herein
 
expressly provided for) and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
          (1) no Junior Subordinated Notes remain Outstanding hereunder;
          (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
          (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with;
provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 401, any Junior Subordinated Note previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.
     In the event there are Junior Subordinated Notes of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all Trustees hereunder.
     If, subsequent to the date a discharge is effected pursuant to this Section 402, Additional Interest (in excess of that established as of the date such discharge is effected) becomes payable in respect of the series of Junior Subordinated Notes discharged, in order to preserve the benefits of the discharge established hereunder, the Company shall irrevocably deposit or cause to be irrevocably deposited in accordance with the provisions of this Section 402, within ten Business Days prior to the date the first payment in respect of any portion of such excess Additional Interest becomes due, such additional funds as are necessary to satisfy the provisions of this Section 402 as if a discharge were being effected as of the date of such subsequent deposit. Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall result in the termination of the benefits of the discharge established by this Section 402.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes under Sections 303, 304, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article shall survive.
Section 403.
Application of Trust Money.
     Neither the Eligible Obligations nor the money deposited pursuant to Section 401, nor the principal or interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations, shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Junior Subordinated Notes or portions of principal amount thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject, however, to the
 
provisions of Section 1003; provided, however, that any cash received from such principal or interest payments on such Eligible Obligations, if not then needed for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon Company Request and delivery to the Trustee of the documents referred to in subclause (y) of clause (c) in Section 401, be invested pursuant to a Company Order in Eligible Obligations of the type described in clause (b) in Section 401 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient, together with any other moneys and the proceeds of any other Eligible Obligations then held by the Trustee, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Junior Subordinated Notes or portions thereof on and prior to the Maturity thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestment shall be paid over to the Company as received; and provided, further, that any moneys held in accordance with this Section on the Maturity of all such Junior Subordinated Notes in excess of the amount required to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due on such Junior Subordinated Notes shall be paid over to the Company.
Section 501.
Events of Default.
     "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body or occasioned by the operation of Article Thirteen):
          (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Junior Subordinated Note of that series when it becomes due and payable on an Interest Payment Date other than at Maturity, including Additional Interest (as defined in clause (ii) of the definition thereof) in respect thereof, and
          (2) continuance of such default for a period of thirty (30) days; provided, however, that (i) a valid extension of the interest payment period by the Company pursuant to the terms of a supplemental indenture authorizing the Junior Subordinated Notes of that series shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose and (ii) no such default shall be deemed to exist if, on or prior to the date on which such interest became due, the Company shall have made a payment sufficient to pay such interest pursuant to the Guarantee related to the Trust Securities of the Securities Trust owning such series of Junior Subordinated Notes, and shall have delivered a notice to the Trustee to that effect; or

          (9) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of that series in the supplemental indenture authorizing such series.
Section 502.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of that series may declare the principal amount (or such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Junior Subordinated Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
          (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
               (A) all overdue interest (including any Additional Interest) on all Junior Subordinated Notes of that series,
               (B) the principal of (and premium, if any) any Junior Subordinated Notes of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Junior Subordinated Notes,
               (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest (including any Additional Interest) at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Junior Subordinated Notes, and
               (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607; and
          (2) all Events of Default with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Junior Subordinated Notes of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 503.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if an Event of Default occurs under Section 501(1), (2), (3) or (4) with respect to any Junior Subordinated Notes the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Junior Subordinated Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Junior Subordinated Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Interest, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest (including Additional Interest, if any), at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Junior Subordinated Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Junior Subordinated Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Junior Subordinated Notes, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 504.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Junior Subordinated Notes or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
          (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
          (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Junior Subordinated Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note in any such proceeding.
Section 505.
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Junior Subordinated Notes.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Junior Subordinated Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 506.
Application of Money Collected.
     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

          Second: Subject to Article Thirteen, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on the Junior Subordinated Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Junior Subordinated Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including Additional Interest, if any), respectively; and
          Third: The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled thereto.

     No Holder of any Junior Subordinated Note of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
          (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of that series;
          (2) the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
          (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
          (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
          (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
Section 508.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture but subject to Article Thirteen, (1) the Holder of any Junior Subordinated Notes shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Junior Subordinated Note on the due dates expressed in such Junior Subordinated Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder; and (2) so long as the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series are held by a Securities Trust, a registered holder of preferred securities issued by such Securities Trust may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Company, without first instituting a legal proceeding directly against or requesting or directing that action be taken by the Property Trustee of such Securities Trust or any other Person, for enforcement of payment to such registered holder of principal of or interest on Junior Subordinated Notes of such series having a principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such preferred securities of such registered holder on or after the due dates therefor specified or provided for in the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series.

Section 510.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Junior Subordinated Notes in the last paragraph of Section 304, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 511.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

          (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Junior Subordinated Note of such series affected.

Subordinated Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the r(emoval o(f the Trustee with respect to all Junior Subordinated Notes and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

In case any Junior Subordinated Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Junior Subordinated Notes so
 
authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Junior Subordinated Notes.
Section 613.

     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Junior Subordinated Notes), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act:
     (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and

Section 614.
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     At any time when any of the Junior Subordinated Notes remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Junior Subordinated Notes that shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Junior Subordinated Notes of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 304, and Junior Subordinated Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Junior Subordinated Notes by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance
 
with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
     The provisions of Sections 306, 604 and 605 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Junior Subordinated Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
          (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on Junior Subordinated Notes of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

          (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.

Section 1101.

Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
     The election of the Company to redeem any Junior Subordinated Notes shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officer's Certificate. The Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee and the related Property Trustee), notify the Trustee and the related Property Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes (i) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes or elsewhere in this Indenture, or (ii) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
 
Section 1103.
Selection by Trustee of Junior Subordinated Notes to be Redeemed.
     If the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered in the name of only one Holder, any partial redemptions shall be pro rata. If the Junior Subordinated Notes are held in definitive form by more than one Holder and if less than all the Junior Subordinated Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of such series not previously called for redemption, by lot or other such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Junior Subordinated Notes of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Junior Subordinated Notes of that series.
     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Junior Subordinated Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Junior Subordinated Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes shall relate, in the case of any Junior Subordinated Notes redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Junior Subordinated Notes which has been or is to be redeemed.

Notice of Redemption.
     Unless otherwise indicated in the supplemental indenture relating to any series of Junior Subordinated Notes, notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106 to the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.
     All notices of redemption shall state:
          (1) the Redemption Date,
          (2) the Redemption Price,
          (3) if less than all the Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed,
          (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Junior Subordinated Note to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
          (5) the place or places where such Junior Subordinated Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and
          (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
 
     Unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Junior Subordinated Notes, in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes at the election of the Company or any redemption which is contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or condition which cannot be ascertained prior to the time a redemption notice is required to be given hereunder, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon receipt by the Trustee or the Paying Agent or Agents for such Junior Subordinated Notes, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of such Junior Subordinated Notes and accrued interest, if any, thereon to the Redemption Date (or direction from the Company to apply such money for the payment of such Junior Subordinated Notes, if such money shall have been deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents upon the condition that the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents will apply such money only at the direction of the Company) and that if such money shall not have been so received (or if such money shall have been received but the Trustee or the Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to apply such money to redeem such Junior Subordinated Notes) such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Junior Subordinated Notes; provided, however, that conditional notice shall not be given if upon the giving of notice, such Junior Subordinated Notes shall be deemed to have been paid in accordance with Section 401. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, or the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to apply such money to the redemption of such Junior Subordinated Notes, the redemption shall not be made, and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received or that the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents have been directed by the Company not to redeem such Junior Subordinated Notes and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Trustee or Paying Agent or Agents for the Junior Subordinated Notes otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Junior Subordinated Notes which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
     Notice of redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. Notice of mandatory redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes shall be given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
Section 1105.
Deposit of Redemption Price.
     Except as otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 301, prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company or its Affiliate is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest, if any, on all the Junior Subordinated Notes which are to be redeemed on that date.
 
Section 1106.
Junior Subordinated Notes Payable on Redemption Date.
     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Junior Subordinated Notes so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified together with any accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) thereon, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Junior Subordinated Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Junior Subordinated Note for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Junior Subordinated Note shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, and any Additional Interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 301, installments of interest on Junior Subordinated Notes whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Junior Subordinated Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 305.
     If any Junior Subordinated Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Junior Subordinated Note.
Section 1107.
Junior Subordinated Notes Redeemed in Part.
     Any Junior Subordinated Note that is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency of the Company therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Junior Subordinated Note without service charge, a new Junior Subordinated Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Junior Subordinated Note so surrendered.
Section 1201.
Applicability of Article.
     The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Junior Subordinated Notes of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Junior Subordinated Notes of such series.
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series, the cash amount of any
 
sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes of any series as provided for by the terms of Junior Subordinated Notes of such series.
Section 1202.
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments With Junior Subordinated Notes.
     The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes of a series (other than any previously called for redemption), and (2) may apply as a credit Junior Subordinated Notes of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Junior Subordinated Notes as provided for by the terms of such series; provided that such Junior Subordinated Notes have not been previously so credited. Such Junior Subordinated Notes shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Junior Subordinated Notes for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 1203.
Redemption of Junior Subordinated Notes for Sinking Fund.
     Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Junior Subordinated Notes of that series pursuant to Section 1202 and stating the basis for such credit and that such Junior Subordinated Notes have not previously been so credited and will also deliver to the Trustee any Junior Subordinated Notes to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Junior Subordinated Notes shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.
Section 1301.
Junior Subordinated Notes Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.
     The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article (subject to Article Four), the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest) on each and all of the Junior
 
Subordinated Notes are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness.
Section 1302.
Payment of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.
     Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company to creditors upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding-up, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors, marshalling of assets or liabilities or any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings of the Company (each such event, if any, referred to as a "Proceeding"), the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due on or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness (including any interest accruing thereon after the commencement of any such Proceeding, whether or not allowed as a claim against the Company in such Proceeding), before the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes are entitled to receive any payment or distribution (excluding any payment described in Section 1309) on account of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on the Junior Subordinated Notes or on account of any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of Junior Subordinated Notes by the Company (all such payments, distributions, purchases, redemptions and acquisitions, whether or not in connection with a Proceeding, herein referred to, individually and collectively, as a "Payment").
     In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior
     Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
     For purposes of this Article, "assets of the Company" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness that may at the time be outstanding; provided, however, that (i) the Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article Eight hereof shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this
 
Section 1302 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article Eight hereof. Nothing in Section 1303 or in this Section 1302 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.
Section 1303.
No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in Default.
     No payment of any principal, including redemption payments, if any, premium, if any, or interest on (including Additional Interest) the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be made if
               (i) any Senior Indebtedness is not paid when due whether at the stated maturity of any such payment or by call for redemption and any applicable grace period with respect to such default has ended, with such default remaining uncured and such default has not been waived or otherwise ceased to exist;
               (ii) the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness has been accelerated because of a default; or
               (iii) notice has been given of the exercise of an option to require repayment, mandatory payment or prepayment or otherwise.
     In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any Payment to the Trustee or any Holder prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, then in such event such Payment shall be held in trust and paid over and delivered forthwith to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness.
     The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any Payment with respect to which Section 1302 hereof would be applicable.
Section 1304.
Payment Permitted if No Default.
     Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall prevent the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1302 hereof or under the conditions described in Section 1303 hereof, from making Payments. Nothing in this Article shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, but, in that event, no payment may be made in violation of the provisions of this Article with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. If payment of the Junior Subordinated Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their representatives) of such acceleration.
Section 1305.
Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     The rights of the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest) on the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the
 
Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.
Section 1306.
Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.
     The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders on the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Junior Subordinated Notes is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, is intended to rank equally with all other general obligations of the Company), to pay to the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest) on the Junior Subordinated Notes as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Junior Subordinated Note from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder or, under the conditions specified in Section 1303, to prevent any payment prohibited by such Section or enforce their rights pursuant to the penultimate paragraph in Section 1303.
Section 1307.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
     Each Holder of a Junior Subordinated Note by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership proceedings, or otherwise, the timely filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of the indebtedness of the Company owing to such Holder in the form required in such proceedings and the causing of such claim to be approved.
Section 1308.
No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.
     No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce the subordination provisions provided herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or any failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions
 
and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
     Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) permit the Company to borrow, repay and then reborrow any or all of the Senior Indebtedness; (iii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (iv) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness; (v) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person; or (vi) apply any sums received by them to Senior Indebtedness.
Section 1309.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.
     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money held in trust by the Trustee under Article Four for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (including Additional Interest) on any series of Junior Subordinated Notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article and no Holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes nor the Trustee shall be obligated to pay over such amount to the Company, any holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a designated representative of such holder) or any other creditor of the Company.
Section 1310.
Notice to the Trustee.
     The Company shall give prompt written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Article. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the provisions of this Article unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee from the Company or a holder or holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section 1310 at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which, by the terms hereof, any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Junior Subordinated Note), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to
 
receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date.
     The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
Section 1311.
Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent.
     Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601 hereof, and the Holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such Proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article, provided that the foregoing shall apply only if such court has been apprised of the provisions of this Article.
Section 1312.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     Subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.
Section 1313.
Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.
     The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
 
     Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607 hereof.
Section 1314.
Article Applicable to Paying Agents.
     In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee (or the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee.
Section 1315.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions.
     Each Holder by accepting a Junior Subordinated Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Section 1401.
No Recourse Against Others.
     An incorporator or any past, present or future director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Junior Subordinated Notes or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Junior Subordinated Note, each Holder shall waive and release all such liability. Such waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Section 1402.
Set-Off.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or in any Junior Subordinated Note of any series, prior to the dissolution of any Securities Trust that has issued Trust Securities related to a series of Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company shall have the right to set-off and apply against any payment it is otherwise required to make hereunder or thereunder with respect to the principal of or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Junior Subordinated Notes of such series with and to the extent the Company has theretofore made, or is concurrently on the date of such payment making, a payment with respect to the Trust Securities of the series related to such series of Junior Subordinated Notes under the applicable Guarantee. Contemporaneously with, or as promptly as practicable after, any such payment under such Guarantee, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate (upon which the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively without any requirement to investigate the facts
 
contained therein) to the effect that such payment has been made and that, as a result of such payment, the corresponding payment under the related series of Junior Subordinated Notes has been set-off in accordance with this Section 1402.
Section 1403.
Assignment; Binding Effect.
     The Company shall have the right at all times to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Indenture to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provided that, in the event of any such assignment, the Company shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all such obligations. This Indenture may also be assigned by the Company in connection with a transaction described in Article Eight. This Indenture shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Trustee, the Holders, any Security Registrar, Paying Agent, and Authenticating Agent and, to the extent specifically set forth herein, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and their respective successors and assigns. The provisions of clause (2) of Section 508 and Section 1006 are for the benefit of the holders of the series of Trust Securities referred to therein and, prior to the dissolution of the related Securities Trust, may be enforced by such holders. A holder of a Trust Security shall not have the right, as such a holder, to enforce any other provision of this Indenture.
Section 1404.
Additional Interest.
     Whenever there is mentioned in this Indenture, in any context, the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Junior Subordinated Note of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Interest provided for by the terms of such series of Junior Subordinated Notes to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms, and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
     This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
