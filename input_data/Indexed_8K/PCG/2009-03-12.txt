Dismissal of Attorney General Lawsuit
     On March 10, 2009, the San Francisco Superior Court dismissed the California Attorney General's lawsuit filed in 2002 against PG&E Corporation and several of its present and former directors. The Attorney General alleged that the defendants had engaged in unfair or fraudulent business acts or practices in violation of Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code. Among other allegations, the Attorney General alleged that past transfers of funds from Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("Utility") to PG&E Corporation during the period from 1997 through 2000 (primarily in the form of dividends and stock repurchases), and allegedly from PG&E Corporation to other affiliates of PG&E Corporation, violated various conditions established by the California Public Utilities Commission. Following a neutral evaluation of the Attorney General's claims by a former California Supreme Court justice, the Attorney General and the defendants jointly requested that the complaint be dismissed. The dismissal is with prejudice, meaning that the Attorney General cannot re-file the complaint. A similar lawsuit filed in 2002 by the City and County of San Francisco against PG&E Corporation remains pending in San Francisco Superior Court. (More information about these matters is included in PG&E Corporation's and Pacific Gas and Electric Company's joint Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
Issuance of 5.75% Senior Notes Due April 1, 2014
     On March 12, 2009, PG&E Corporation completed the sale of $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014. For further information concerning the notes, refer to the exhibits attached to this report.

Schedule I hereto of the several Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          PG&E Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of California (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representatives, $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014 (the "Securities") having the terms set forth in Schedule I hereto, to be issued under an indenture, dated as of March 12, 2009 (the "Base Indenture") and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of March 12, 2009 (the "Supplemental Indenture") and together with the Base Indenture, (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"). To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 20 hereof.

statement, as defined in Rule 405 (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on Form S-3, including a related Base Prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the Execution Time, became effective upon filing. The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more preliminary prospectus supplements relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such final prospectus supplement shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Execution Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x).

material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect").
     (h) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     (i) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company; and at the Closing Date each of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture will have been, duly executed and delivered by the Company; and, at the Closing Date, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, each of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by laws and principles of equity affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors laws; and each of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act as of the Closing Date.

     (m) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations which, individually or in the aggregate, if the subject of
 
an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (n) None of the issue and sale of the Securities, the consummation of any other of the transactions herein contemplated or the performance by the Company of any of its obligations set forth herein will conflict with or result in, a breach or violation of: (i) the charter, bylaws or comparable constituent documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their properties, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, breaches or violations which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     (o) The consolidated historical financial statements and schedules of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and the Registration Statement present fairly in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein).

     (q) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements and schedules included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, is an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
 
     (r) Except as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (i) in violation of any statute, any rule, regulation, decision or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, relating to the use, disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or relating to the protection or restoration of the environment or human exposure to hazardous or toxic substances (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), (ii) owns or operates any real property contaminated with any substance that is subject to any Environmental Laws, (iii) is liable for any off-site disposal or contamination pursuant to any Environmental Laws, or (iv) is subject to any claim relating to any Environmental Laws, which violation, contamination, liability or claim could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and there is no investigation pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against it or its subsidiaries, that could reasonably be expected to lead to the making of such a claim.

Agreements
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus) to the Base Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use, any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for the purpose of suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent (i) the issuance of such stop order or other order referred to in the preceding sentence, or (ii) the occurrence of (A) any suspension of the effectiveness, or objection to the use, of the Registration Statement or (B) any prevention or suspension of the use of the preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the
 
Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
     (b) The Company shall prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in the form approved by you and attached as Schedule IV hereto and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
     (c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representatives of any such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
     (f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus,
 
the Final Prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
     (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or one or more free writing prospectuses through customary Bloomberg distribution that do not contain substantive changes from or additions to the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto or a term sheet, substantially in the form of Schedule IV hereto and any electronic road show. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or the offering or (ii) information permitted by Rule 134. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping and that it will not take any action that would result in any Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that such Underwriter would not otherwise have been required to so file.
     (i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly,
 
including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto.
     (j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
     (k) The Company agrees to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement to any of them; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may, in each case, be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing, authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) any registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of the several states (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such registration and qualification); (vi) any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (including filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters relating to such filings); (vii) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company representatives in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder.
          6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (ii) carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to December 31, 2008, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that, with respect to the period subsequent to December 31, 2008, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt or short-term borrowings of the Company and its subsidiaries or the capital stock of the Company or decreases in current assets or the shareholders' equity of the Company, as compared with the amounts shown on the December 31, 2008 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from January 1, 2009 to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year in operating revenues, net revenues, income before income taxes or net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges" and "Capitalization" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1,
 
1A, 6, 7 and 7A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities, (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (B) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus
 
constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. No indemnifying party will be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify
provided
however
 
and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance
Default by an Underwriter
 
of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

     Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
 
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
     (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Senior Notes held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Senior Note shall bind every future Holder of the same Senior Note and the Holder of every Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Senior Note.
     (e) The fact and date of execution of any such instrument or writing and the authority of the Person executing the same may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient; and the Trustee may in any instance require further proof with respect to any of the matters referred to in this Section.
     (f) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Senior Notes of any series any Act, the Company may, at its option, by Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders of Senior Notes entitled to take such Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Any such record date shall be fixed at the Company's discretion. If such a record date is fixed, such Act may be sought or given before or after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders of Senior Notes for the purpose of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Senior Notes of such series Outstanding have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act, and for that purpose the Senior Notes of such series Outstanding shall be computed as of such record date.
Section 105.
Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.
     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,
          (1) the Trustee by any Holder of a Senior Note or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Trust and Securities Services, or transmitted by facsimile transmission or other direct written electronic means to such telephone number or other electronic communications address as the Trustee shall from time to time designate, or

Section 106.
Notice to Holders of Senior Notes; Waiver.
     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Senior Notes of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such Notice.
     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Senior Notes shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

          (5) Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders, of Outstanding Senior Notes represented thereby shall be made in such manner and by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered pursuant to Section 302 with respect thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 302, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any such Global Security in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order.

Section 302.
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Senior Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by any two of the following: the President, the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer. The corporate seal of the Company may be affixed thereto or reproduced thereon and attested by any Authorized Officer, the Secretary of the Company or any Assistant Secretary of the Company. The signature of any of these officers on the Senior Notes may be manual or facsimile.
 
     Senior Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at the time relevant to the authorization thereof the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Senior Notes.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Senior Notes of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Senior Notes, and the Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Senior Notes. If all of the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Senior Notes and determining the terms of particular Senior Notes of such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating Senior Notes hereunder, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Senior Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
          (1) an Opinion of Counsel, to the effect that the form and terms of such Senior Notes or the manner of determining such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
          (2) an Officer's Certificate stating, to the knowledge of the signer of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect to any of the Senior Notes shall have occurred and be continuing.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Senior Notes if the issue of such Senior Notes pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Senior Notes and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     If all the Senior Notes of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officer's Certificate at the time of issuance of each such Senior Note, but such opinion and certificate shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Senior Note of such series to be issued.
     Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Senior Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Senior Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Senior Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Senior Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Section 303.
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Security Registrar designated pursuant to this Section 303 or Section 1002 a register (referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Senior Notes and of transfers of Senior Notes. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Security Registrar for the purpose of registering Senior Notes and transfers of Senior Notes as herein provided.
     Subject to Section 203, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Senior Note of any series at the office or agency maintained for such purpose for such series, the Company shall execute, and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
     Subject to Section 203, Senior Notes of any series may be exchanged, at the option of the Holder, for Senior Notes of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Senior Notes to be exchanged at any such office or agency.
     Whenever any Senior Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Senior Notes that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Senior Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Senior Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Senior Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 907 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange Senior Notes of any series during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is given identifying the serial numbers of the Senior Notes of that series called for redemption, or (ii) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Senior Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Senior Note being redeemed in part.
 
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 304.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Senior Notes.
     If any mutilated Senior Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and, as directed by the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Senior Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Senior Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note, a new Senior Note of the same series, Stated Maturity and original issue date, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Senior Note, pay such Senior Note.
     Upon the issuance of any new Senior Note under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Senior Note of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Senior Note shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Senior Notes of that series duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes.
Section 305.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Senior Notes, interest on any Senior Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
     Any interest on any Senior Note of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
          (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Senior Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Senior Notes of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Senior Notes of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
          (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Senior Notes of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, and after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause that such manner of payment has been deemed practicable by the Company.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Senior Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Senior Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Senior Note.
 
Section 306.
Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Senior Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Senior Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Senior Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Senior Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 307.
Cancellation.
     All Senior Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Senior Notes so delivered shall be canceled by the Trustee. No Senior Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Senior Notes canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Senior Notes held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with a Company Order and the Trustee shall promptly deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company.
Section 308.
Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Senior Notes of any series, interest on the Senior Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Section 401.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Senior Notes.
     Any Senior Note or Senior Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, shall be deemed to have been paid and no longer Outstanding for all purposes of this Indenture, and the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall be satisfied and discharged, if there shall have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust:
     (a) money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or
     (b) in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys
 
which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or
     (c) a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Senior Notes or portions thereof; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for payment or redemption of less than all the Senior Notes of any series, such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Security Registrar as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:
     (x) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes, a Company Order stating that the money and Eligible Obligations deposited in accordance with this Section shall be held in trust, as provided in Section 403;
     (y) if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing or a firm of independent public accountants of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the other requirements set forth in clause (b) or (c) above have been satisfied; and
     (z) if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Senior Notes, an Officer's Certificate stating the Company's intention that, upon delivery of such Officer's Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section.
     Upon the deposit of money or Eligible Obligations, or both, in accordance with this Section, together with the documents required by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, the Trustee shall, upon Company Request, acknowledge in writing that such Senior Notes or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture and that the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof has been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Senior Notes or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officer's Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefits of this Indenture (other than with respect to such deposit) or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article X (except the covenants contained in Sections 1002 and 1003) or any other covenants made in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 301, but the indebtedness of the Company in respect of such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such Senior Notes or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
     If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Senior Notes of any series is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Security Registrar shall select such Senior Notes, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 1103 for selection for redemption of less than all the Senior Notes of a series .
     In the event that Senior Notes which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Company's indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section, do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the 60-day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Senior Notes, to the Holders of such Senior Notes to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof.
     Notwithstanding that any Senior Notes shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Senior Notes under Sections 303, 304, 603, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article Four shall survive.
     The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit.
     Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Senior Note would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, such Senior Note shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Senior Note shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Company's indebtedness in respect of any Senior Notes shall be subject to the provisions of Section 403.
Section 402.
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     This Indenture shall, upon Company Request, cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes herein expressly provided for) and the Trustee, at the expense and request of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
          (1) no Senior Notes remain Outstanding hereunder;
          (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
 
          (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with;
provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 401, any Senior Note previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.
     In the event there are Senior Notes of two or more series hereunder, the Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so by the Company with respect to Senior Notes of all series as to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such instruments from all Trustees hereunder.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Senior Notes under Sections 303, 304, 603, 607, 614, 1002, 1003 and 1104 and this Article Four shall survive.

          (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition by one or more Persons other than the Company seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official for the Company or for any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
          (6) the commencement by the Company of a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in a case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or
 
state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; or
          (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Senior Notes of that series in the supplemental indenture authorizing such series.
Section 502.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the
     Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series may declare the principal amount (or such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Senior Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Senior Notes of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
          (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
               (A) all overdue interest on all Senior Notes of that series,
               (B) the principal of (and premium, if any) any Senior Notes of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes,
               (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and
               (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607; and
          (2) all Events of Default with respect to Senior Notes of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Senior Notes of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 503.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if an Event of Default occurs under Section 501(1), (2) or (3) with respect to any Senior Notes the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Senior Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Senior Notes, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Senior Notes, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Senior Notes of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 504.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Senior Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
          (1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Senior Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of Senior Notes allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
          (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Senior Notes to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Senior Notes, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Senior Note any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Senior Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Senior Note in any such proceeding.
Section 505.
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Senior Notes.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Senior Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Senior Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name or as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 506.
Application of Money Collected.
     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Senior Notes, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and
     Second: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Senior Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Senior Notes for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and
     Third: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto.
Section 507.
Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of any Senior Note of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
 
          (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes of that series;
          (2) the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
          (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
          (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
          (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
Section 508.
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Senior Notes shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 305) interest on such Senior Note on the due dates expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 509.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee or any Holder of a Senior Note has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Notes shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 510.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes in the last paragraph of Section 304, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent
 
permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 511.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Senior Note to exercise any right or remedy upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Senior Notes may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Senior Notes.
Section 512.
Control by Holders of Senior Notes.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Senior Notes of such series, provided that
          (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where reasonable indemnity would not be adequate, and
          (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
Section 513.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Senior Notes of such series, waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
          (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note of such series, or
          (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Senior Note of such series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 514.
Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Senior Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Senior Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Note on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Senior Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
Section 515.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that
          (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
          (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

          (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Senior Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Senior Notes of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Senior Notes of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Notes of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Senior Notes and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder of a Senior Note who has been a bona fide Holder of a Senior Note of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of such series.
     (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series and each appointment of a successor
 
Trustee with respect to the Senior Notes of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of such series of Senior Notes as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register.
Section 611.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
     (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Senior Notes, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
     (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.

     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Senior Notes shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Senior Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Senior Notes.
Section 613.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Senior Notes), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act:
     (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and
     (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.
Section 614.
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     At any time when any of the Senior Notes remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Senior Notes that shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Senior Notes of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 304, and Senior Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever
 
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Senior Notes by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Senior Notes, if any, of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
     The provisions of Sections 306, 604 and 605 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
 
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Senior Notes of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Senior Notes of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Senior Notes, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Notes of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

     This 5.75% Senior Note Due April 1, 2014 is one of a duly authorized issue of Senior Notes of the Company, issued and issuable in one or more series under a Senior Note Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2009 (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and with all additional indentures supplemental thereto, and any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Senior Notes, being herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Notes thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon which Senior Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Senior Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the 5.75% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company ("Optional Redemption"), in whole or in part, prior to Maturity, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:
          (a) 100% of the principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes to be redeemed; or
          (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments of principal and interest on the 5.75% Senior Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points,
plus, in either of the above cases, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the Redemption Date.
     Interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to Holders of such 5.75% Senior Notes, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.

proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Senior Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Senior Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Senior Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

     Prior to due presentment of this Senior Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Senior Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Senior Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     This Senior Note shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereunder, except to the extent that the Trust Indenture Act shall be applicable.
 
     As provided in the Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest with respect to this Senior Note, or any part thereof, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or of the indebtedness represented hereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture and all the 5.75% Senior Notes are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance of this Senior Note.
