Dismissal of City and County of San Francisco Lawsuit
On April 23, 2009, the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) dismissed the lawsuit it filed in San Francisco Superior Court in 2002 against PG&E Corporation.  CCSF had alleged that past transfers of funds from Pacific Gas and Electric Company to PG&E Corporation during the period from 1997 through 2000 (primarily in the form of dividends and stock repurchases) and allegedly from PG&E Corporation to other affiliates of PG&E Corporation, violated various conditions established by the California Public Utilities Commission.  CCSFs lawsuit was similar to one filed by the California Attorney General in 2002 that was dismissed in March 2009, as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 10, 2009 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2009.
