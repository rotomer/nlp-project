Item 8.01.  Other Events
Energy Efficiency Programs and Incentive Ratemaking
On November 17, 2009, the administrative law judge presiding over the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) energy efficiency incentive ratemaking proceeding released a proposed decision (PD) that, if adopted by the CPUC, would award Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) incentive earnings of $14.7 million based on the Utilitys achievement of energy efficiency savings during the 2006-2008 energy efficiency program period.  The PD recommends that an additional $30.3 million be held back and subject to verification in the final true-up process to be completed in 2010.  In addition, on November 17, 2009, a CPUC Commissioner released an alternate proposed decision (APD) that recommends that the Utility be awarded $33.4 million and that an additional $40.3 million be held back and subject to verification in the final true-up process to be completed in 2010.
The CPUC previously awarded the Utility $41.5 million in December 2008 based on the Utilitys first interim claim for energy efficiency program performance in 2006-2007.
Both the PD and the APD (1) rely upon data presented in the CPUCs Energy Divisions second interim verification report issued on October 15, 2009, (2) decline to adopt the proposed settlement submitted by the Utility and other parties in May 2009, and (3) recommend a schedule for the 2010 true-up process that contemplates the release of a proposed decision by July 15, 2010 and a final decision by mid-September 2010.
Under the applicable rules, the CPUC must wait at least 30 days, i.e., until December 17, 2009 when the CPUC is scheduled to hold  its last meeting in 2009, before it can approve a final decision.
