(San Francisco)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE:PCG) consolidated net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called income available for common shareholders) for 2009 was $1.22 billion, or $3.20 per share, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with 2008 results of $1.34 billion, or $3.63 per share, which included the one-time benefits of a settlement of federal tax audits for years 2001-2004 which totaled $257 million, or $0.68 per share.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations were $3.21 per share for 2009, compared with $2.95 per share in 2008 (which excludes the benefits of the tax settlement). Earnings from operations for 2009 exclude the impact of several one-time items -- tax refunds for years 1998-1999, the recovery of previously incurred costs related to the Utilitys hydroelectric generation assets, costs to perform accelerated work on the natural gas system, and certain employee severance costs. The net impact of these items for 2009 was ($0.01) per share.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2009, PG&E Corporations consolidated net income was $273 million, or $0.71 cents per share, compared with $517 million, or $1.37 per share, in the same quarter of 2008 when the benefits of the tax settlement were recognized. On a non-GAAP earnings from operations basis, PG&E Corporations results in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.80 per share, compared with $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
The majority of the higher year-over-year earnings from operations results from additional revenues generated by new capital investments in the Utilitys infrastructure. The Utilitys capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion for the year, increasing the asset base on which the Utility is allowed to earn its authorized return. In addition to higher revenues from new capital investments, fourth quarter earnings from operations reflect a number of smaller, positive items for recovery of previously incurred costs and improved operational performance.
 
We posted solid earnings for 2009, reflecting an ongoing commitment to invest in our systems and our people for the benefit of PG&Es customers, communities and shareholders, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation. We will continue these initiatives in 2010 with the goal of always delivering better, faster more cost-effective service and showing leadership on the environment, including efforts to address climate change.
 
 
 
Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirms its previous guidance for 2010 earnings from operations in the range of $3.35-$3.50 per share and $3.65-$3.85 per share for 2011.
 
Guidance is based on various assumptions, including that the Utility maintains a ratemaking capital structure of 52 percent equity and an authorized return on equity of 11.35 percent, while growing its asset base, earning incentive revenues for energy efficiency achievements, and realizing operational efficiencies in amounts consistent with low and high case earnings ranges.
 
Guidance for 2010 earnings from operations excludes forecasted costs to support a state-wide ballot initiative requiring local governments to gain voter support before using taxpayer money to establish electric service. This one-time item reflects activities outside of PG&Es regular utility operations and is expected to impact total GAAP earnings between $0.06 and $0.09 per share for the year. Guidance for 2010 earnings from operations does not exclude normal ongoing costs related to competitive issues.
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and bases guidance on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
 
 
Common Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends
 
PG&E Corporation is raising its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.455 per share from $0.42 cents per share, beginning with the first quarter 2010 payment.  The dividend is payable on April 15, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 31, 2010.  This increases the annual dividend rate to $1.82 from the previous $1.68 level.
 
In addition, the Utility declared dividends on all outstanding series of its preferred stock for the three months ending April 30, 2010, payable on May 15, 2010, to shareholders of record on April 30, 2010.
 
In order to be considered a shareholder of record for the common and preferred dividend payments, you must have purchased the stock at least three trading days before the applicable record date.
 
The Utility will pay dividends on its eight series of preferred stock as follows:
