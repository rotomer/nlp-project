Proposed Renewable Energy Development
On March 2, 2010, a revised alternate proposed decision was issued that, if approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), would authorize PG&E Corporations subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) to develop up to 250 megawatts (MW) of renewable generation resources based on solar photovoltaic (PV) technology at an estimated capital cost of approximately $1.5 billion over five years.  The revised alternate proposed decision recommends that the Utility be authorized to recover its costs to develop Utility-owned PV generation facilities through traditional cost-of-service ratemaking that would provide the Utility an opportunity to earn a rate of return on its capital investment. The revised alternate proposed decision also would authorize the Utility to conduct an annual request for offers (RFO) during each year of the five-year program to enter into power purchase agreements for up to an additional 250 MW of PV generation to be developed by independent power producers. As previously disclosed, on January 26, 2010, a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision were issued that would authorize the Utility to recover its costs based on the weighted average price of the winning bids received in response to the Utilitys annual RFO, subject to an overall price cap.  If either of the proposed decisions issued on January 26, 2010 were adopted by the CPUC, the Utilitys cost recovery would depend on the amount of power produced by the Utility-owned PV facilities and the applicable weighted average price of winning bids. The Utility would decide each year whether to build Utility-owned PV facilities after the applicable weighted average winning bid price had been determined.
The CPUC may adopt one of the proposed decisions or the CPUC may adopt a final decision that differs from the proposed decisions.  It is uncertain when the CPUC will issue a final decision.
