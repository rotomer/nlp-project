Proposed Renewable Energy Development
On April 22, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted to issue a final decision approving Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) five-year proposal to build up to 250 megawatts (MW) of renewable generation resources based on solar photovoltaic (PV) technology and enter into power purchase agreements for an additional 250 MW of PV generation resources following an annual request for offers (RFO) for third parties to develop PV facilities.  The CPUC authorized the Utility to recover the actual capital costs to develop up to 250 MW of solar PV generation facilities, subject to a corresponding cap of up to $1.45 billion. If total capital costs exceed the cost cap, the Utility could only recover such costs afte r obtaining CPUC approval.  The CPUC also established an incentive mechanism that allows the Utility shareholders to retain ten percent of the savings if the actual average per-kilowatt capital cost of the Utility-owned program is less than $3, 920.00 per kilowatt.  The remaining ninety percent of any such savings would be passed through to customers. As the Utilitys new PV facilities begin commercial operation, the project costs would be included in the Utilitys rate base, as the Utility had proposed, and the Utility would be entitled to earn a rate of return on the additional rate base.  The Utility intends to begin an RFO for the power purchase agreement portion of the program and a separate RFO to request third parties to submit proposals to develop and construct the Utility-owned portion of the program after the CPUC approves the implementation details of each RFO.
