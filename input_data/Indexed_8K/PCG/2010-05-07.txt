We delivered solid results in the first quarter and are on track to deliver on our guidance for the year, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation.  Going forward, we will continue to execute on plans to invest new capital consistent with our customers and Californias near- and long-term energy priorities, including reliability, increased efficiency, and cleaner sources of power.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share from operations primarily reflects higher authorized revenues associated with additional capital investments in Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (Utility) core infrastructure, the absence of a scheduled refueling outage at Diablo Canyon Power Plant and the associated expenses that lowered earnings in last years first quarter, and a number of smaller positive items. These items were partially offset by higher storm-related costs and an increased number of common shares outstanding. Earnings from operations for the most recent quarter exclude costs associated with the tax impact of the recently enacted federal healthcare bill, and support for a statewide ballot initiative.
 
Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation reaffirms its previous guidance for earnings from operations in the range of $3.35-$3.50 per share for 2010 and $3.65-$3.85 per share for 2011.
 
Guidance is based on various assumptions, including that the Utility maintains a
ratemaking capital structure of 52 percent common equity and achieves a return on equity of at least 11.35 percent, while growing its asset base and earning incentive revenues for energy efficiency achievements consistent with low and high case earnings ranges provided at the companys March 2010 Investor Conference.
 
Guidance for 2010 earnings from operations excludes the one-time costs described above. These one-time items reflect activities outside of PG&Es regular utility operations and are expected to impact total GAAP earnings by $0.14 per share for the year.
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and bases guidance on
earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare
the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive

of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings
from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in
accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of
results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on
consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).

explosions, fires, accidents, mechanical breakdowns, the disruption of information technology and systems, and similar
events that can cause unplanned outages, reduce generating output, damage the Utilitys assets or operations, subject
the Utility to third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or result in the imposition of civil, criminal, or
regulatory fines or penalties on the Utility;
the impact of storms, earthquakes, floods, drought, wildfires, disease and similar natural disasters, or acts of terrorism
or vandalism, that affect customer demand, or that damage or disrupt the facilities, operations, or information
technology and systems owned by the Utility, its customers, or third parties on which the Utility relies;
the potential impacts of climate change on the Utilitys electricity and natural gas businesses;

changes in customer demand for electricity and natural gas resulting from unanticipated population growth or decline,
general economic and financial market conditions, changes in technology that include the development of alternative
technologies that enable customers to increase their reliance on self-generation, or other reasons;
the occurrence of unplanned outages at the Utilitys two nuclear generating units at Diablo Canyon, the availability of
nuclear fuel, the outcome of the Utilitys application to renew the operating licenses for Diablo Canyon, and potential
changes in laws or regulations with respect to the storage of spent nuclear fuel, security, safety or other matters
associated with the operations at Diablo Canyon;
whether the Utility can operate  efficiently to achieve cost savings and identify and successfully implement additional sustainable cost-saving measures;
whether the Utility earns incentive revenues or incurs obligations under incentive ratemaking mechanisms;

holding companies;

how the CPUC administers the conditions imposed on PG&E Corporation when it became the Utilitys holding
company;
the outcome of litigation, including litigation involving the application of various California wage and hour laws, and the extent to which PG&E Corporation or the Utility incurs costs and liabilities in connection with litigation that are not recoverable through rates, from insurance, or from other third parties;
the ability of PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and counterparties to access capital markets and other sources of credit in
a timely manner on acceptable terms;
