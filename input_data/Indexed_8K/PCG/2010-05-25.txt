Proposed Electric Distribution Reliability Program (Cornerstone Improvement Program)
On May 25, 2010, an administrative law judge at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) released a proposed decision that, if adopted by the CPUC, would authorize Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) to implement electric distribution reliability improvement projects and incur capital expenditures of approximately $357 million beginning in 2011 and continuing through 2013.   Although the proposed decision states that the Utility has not demonstrated the need for its proposed $2 billion six-year electric distribution reliability improvement program, it recommends a scaled-back program to implement specific elements of the Utilitys proposed program.  The proposed decision also notes that additional investment in relia bility projects would be considered in the Utilitys 2014 general rate case and subsequent general rate cases.  The proposed decision recommends the adoption of the Utilitys proposal to set rates based on the adopted cost forecasts with a balancing account to accumulate any difference in revenue requirement based on recorded costs compared to the adopted forecast.   The Utility would be required to file annual reports (by January 31) to describe work performed during the previous calendar year and to include a forecast of work to be performed in the current year.
Comments on the proposed decision are due on June 14, 2010.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict whether the CPUC will adopt the proposed decision.
