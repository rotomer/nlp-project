Electric Distribution Reliability Program (Cornerstone Improvement Program)
On June 24, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted to authorize Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) to implement electric distribution reliability improvement projects and incur capital expenditures of approximately $357 million beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2013.  Although the CPUC determined that the Utility had not demonstrated the need for the entirety of its proposed $2 billion six-year electric distribution reliability improvement program, the CPUC authorized a scaled-back program to implement portions of the Utilitys proposed program.  The decision also notes that any additional investment in reliability projects beyond that approved in the decision can be considered in the Utilitys 2014 general rate case and subsequent general rate cases.  The CPUC adopted the Utilitys proposal to set rates based on the adopted cost forecasts with a balancing account to accumulate any difference in revenue requirement based on recorded costs compared to the adopted forecast.   The Utility is required to file annual reports (by March 1) to describe work performed during the previous calendar year and to include a forecast of work to be performed in the current year.
