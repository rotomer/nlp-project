Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 23, 2010, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered an investigation of (1) the explosion of a natural gas transmission line owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (San Bruno explosion) and (2) the safety of the Utilitys natural gas transmission pipelines in its northern and central California service territory.  The CPUC order also called for the CPUC to establish an independent review panel of experts within 60 days to gather facts, review these facts and make recommendations to the CPUC as to whether there is a need for the general improvement of the safety of the Utilitys natural gas transmission lines, and if so, how these improvements should be made.  The me mbers of the panel will be selected by the President of the CPUC, subject to confirmation by a vote of the CPUC.
In addition, the CPUC ratified the mandates that the CPUCs Executive Director had previously communicated to the Utility in a September 13, 2010 letter directing the Utility to conduct an accelerated gas leak survey of all natural gas transmission lines and take certain other actions.  The Utility began to undertake many of these tasks immediately after receiving the CPUC Executive Directors letter.  The CPUC set various due dates during October 2010 by which the Utility is required to complete the various tasks and report back to the CPUC.
The Utility is committed to cooperating fully with the CPUC and the independent panel to investigate the cause of the San Bruno explosion.
