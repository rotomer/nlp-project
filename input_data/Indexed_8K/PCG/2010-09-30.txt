Energy Efficiency Programs and Incentive Ratemaking
On September 28, 2010, a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision were issued in the final true-up phase of the energy efficiency incentive ratemaking proceeding pending at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  In the true-up phase, the CPUC will determine the final amounts to be awarded to (or refunded by) the California investor-owned utilities based on the energy savings achieved through implementation of their respective 2006-2008 energy efficiency programs.  The CPUC has previously awarded Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) incentive revenues totaling $75 million for implementation of its 2006-2008 programs.  The proposed decision recommends that no additional incentive revenues be awarded to the Utility based on energy savings assumptions an d calculations used by the CPUCs Energy Division which the utilities had contested.  The alternate proposed decision recommends that the Utility be awarded additional incentive revenues of $40.3 million, an amount equal to the amounts that had been held back from the interim awards.
The CPUC is scheduled to issue a final decision to complete the true-up process by the end of 2010.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the final amount of incentive revenues, if any, that the Utility will receive.
