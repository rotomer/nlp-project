Item 8.01.  Other Events
On January 19, 2011, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) requested that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) permit the Utility to withdraw an application the Utility had filed with the CPUC on December 3, 2009 seeking authorization to acquire, develop and construct the proposed Manzana wind project and recover the costs in rates.  The Utility had entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire the project from the current owner, Iberdrola Renewables, Inc.  On January 14, 2011, Iberdrola Renewables, Inc. gave the Utility notice that it was exercising its right to terminate the agreement.  The notice of termination follows the proposed decision to deny the Utilitys original application that was issued on December 21, 2010 by the CPUC administrative law judge assigned to consider the Utilitys original application.  It is uncertain whether or when the CPUC will grant the Utilitys request to withdraw the application.
