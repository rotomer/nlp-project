(SAN FRANCISCO)  PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) today reported its 2010 financial results, including the cost impacts associated with the September 9, 2010 natural gas transmission pipeline accident in San Bruno, California.
 
Net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called income available for common shareholders) was $1.10 billion or $2.82 per share, for 2010, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This compares to $1.22 billion or $3.20 per share, in 2009.  For the fourth quarter, net income was $250 million, or $0.63 per share, compared with $273 million, or $0.71 per share, in the same period of 2009.
 
GAAP results for the year reflect San Bruno-related costs totaling $283 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.43 per share.  These costs included a $220 million provision booked in the third quarter for property damage, personal injury, and other third-party claims, as well as an additional $63 million in direct costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters for providing immediate support to the San Bruno community, re-inspecting natural gas transmission lines, and conducting other activities related to the accident.
 
We are focusing the necessary resources and attention on the safety and reliability of our gas operations and improving those operations as we learn from the San Bruno tragedy, said Peter A. Darbee, Chairman, CEO, and President of PG&E Corporation. Our customers, shareholders, regulators, and other stakeholders have our commitment that PG&E will vigorously apply the lessons that emerge from this experience.
 
On a non-GAAP basis  which excludes San Bruno-related costs as well as other one-time items  PG&E Corporations earnings from operations were $1.33 billion, or $3.42 per share, for 2010.  This compares with $1.22 billion, or $3.21 per share, for 2009.  Full-year earnings from operations for 2010 were within the companys previously issued guidance range of $3.35 per share to $3.50 per share.
 
For the fourth quarter, earnings from operations were $277 million, or $0.70 per share, compared with $304 million, or $0.80 per share, in the same period last year.  The $0.10 per share decrease quarter-over-quarter reflects higher estimated costs to complete the SmartMeter program, the impact of a regularly scheduled nuclear refueling outage at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and a number of other smaller items.
 
 
2011 Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation is maintaining previously issued guidance for earnings from operations (non-GAAP) in the range of $3.65 to $3.80 per share for 2011.  Guidance excludes estimated San Bruno-related costs for 2011 which are being treated as an item impacting comparability.
 
Including estimated San Bruno-related costs for 2011, PG&E Corporations projected 2011 earnings per share on a GAAP basis has been updated to $2.94 to $3.50 per share.  As a result of substantial records validation efforts underway and additional pipeline testing and inspection that may be required, the estimated range for 2011 direct costs associated with the accident has increased to $200 million to $300 million pre-tax, compared to the prior range of $100 million to $150 million for 2010 and 2011 combined.  The estimated range for third-party liability for 2011 remains $0 to $180 million pre-tax.  This is in addition to a $220 million provision for third-party liability booked in the third quarter of 2010.  Projected results for 2011 do not reflect insurance recoveries, which may not occur until after 2011.
 
Guidance is based on various assumptions, including approval of the settlement reached in Pacific Gas and Electric Companys 2011 General Rate Case (GRC), capital spending consistent with the GRC settlement and other regulatory decisions, and the ability to earn the return on equity authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
 
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations.  Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
