                                       May 4, 2011                      
PG&E CORPORATION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER PERFORMANCE; ADJUSTS OUTLOOK FOR FULL-YEAR 2011 RESULTS; FORGOES DIVIDEND INCREASE IN 2011
 
(SAN FRANCISCO)  PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) today reported that its first quarter 2011 financial results were adversely affected by expenses that its utility subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, incurred to improve the safety of its natural gas transmission pipeline system and respond to numerous severe winter storms, the timing effects of key regulatory decisions, and several other items. The company also indicated that the utility expects to incur higher costs in connection with the increased scope of gas pipeline safety-related work going forward.  The cumulative effect of these impacts, both in the quarter and for the year, is significant enough that PG&E Corporation is revising its previously issued guidance for 2011 and has decided not to increase its common stock dividend in 2011.
 
GAAP Earnings
 
Net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called income available for common shareholders) was $199 million, or $0.50 per share, for the quarter, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This compares to $258 million, or $0.67 per share, for the same period in 2010.
 
GAAP results for the first quarter reflect incurred costs of $51 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.08 per share, associated with pipeline safety-related actions the utility is taking following the San Bruno accident.  In the first quarter, the utility undertook an unprecedented initiative to collect, scan, and review approximately 1.3 million documents to locate gas pipeline pressure testing records covering decades of operations.  PG&E is drawing on this information as it implements an aggressive and expanded action plan, now under way, to do engineering analysis and conduct increased testing and other field work on certain pipelines.
 
Since the San Bruno accident, the utility has incurred a total cost of $114 million on a pre-tax basis associated with gas pipeline safety-related actions, in addition to a $220 million provision that was taken for estimated third-party liabilities associated with the accident.
 
Earnings from Operations
 
PG&E Corporations quarterly earnings from operations  a non-GAAP measure that excludes the $51 million of costs incurred for the gas pipeline safety-related work  also declined relative to last year. Earnings from operations were $230 million, or $0.58 per share, for the first quarter 2011, compared with $303 million, or $0.79 per share, for the same period in 2010.
 
Several factors account for the decrease. Earnings from operations were impacted by the series of severe winter storms that struck PG&Es service area in February and March. The company experienced 24 days of significant emergency response activity during the quarter, more than double the number for the first quarter of 2010. The resulting storm-related costs drove a $0.05 per share decline in the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
 
Also affecting the quarter is the timing impact related to the utilitys 2011 General Rate Case (GRC) and its Gas Transmission and Storage (GT&S) rate case. With settlement agreements in both cases pending before the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) at the end of the quarter, the company has not yet recorded revenues to cover certain normal increases in yearly operating expenses associated with such factors as inflation and customer growth.  This impacted the quarter-over-quarter comparison by a negative $0.07 per share.  The revenue changes will be retroactive to January 1, 2011, and will be recorded upon final approval by the CPUC.
 
PG&E also incurred a charge of $0.06 for litigation and regulatory matters unrelated to the San Bruno accident.  Additionally, the quarter reflected a $0.03 per share decline due to the impact of unfavorable market conditions, including lower seasonal spreads on gas storage revenues, and a $0.03 per share decline due to an increase in the number of PG&E Corporation common shares outstanding.
 
Partially offsetting the negative items for the quarter is a $0.04 per share increase that reflects higher authorized revenues associated with electric transmission investments and certain projects such as the completed Colusa and Humboldt power plants.
 
We are disappointed in the results for the quarter, said PG&E Corporation Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Kent Harvey.  Given the results in the first quarter and our outlook for the year, we believe its necessary to lower guidance for 2011 earnings per share from operations.  In addition, the increased scope of gas pipeline safety-related work we now have planned for the year will further impact our 2011 GAAP earnings.  As a result, we have decided not to increase the common stock dividend during 2011.
 
 
2011 Guidance for Earnings from Operations
 
PG&E Corporation is reducing previously issued guidance for 2011 earnings from operations (non-GAAP) by approximately 5 percent, to $3.45 to $3.60 per share.  The previous guidance was $3.65 to $3.80 per share. (Guidance for earnings from operations excludes the costs incurred in connection with gas pipeline safety-related work and third-party liabilities related to the San Bruno accident, which are being treated as an item impacting comparability.)
 
The change in guidance reflects a number of considerations. In addition to the storm costs and other charges taken in the first quarter, unfavorable gas market conditions and higher-than-expected litigation expenses may continue to put downward pressure on earnings during 2011.
 
Additionally, while the extraordinary gas pipeline safety-related expenses are not included in earnings from operations, they do result in the need for additional equity to maintain the utilitys authorized capital structure.  The corresponding increase in the number of PG&E Corporation common shares outstanding is expected to lower earnings from operations on a per-share basis.
 
2011 Guidance for GAAP Earnings
 
PG&E Corporations projected 2011 earnings per share on a GAAP basis, which includes the costs incurred in connection with gas pipeline safety-related work and third-party liabilities related to the San Bruno accident, has been updated to $2.37 to $3.08 per share.
 
It is now estimated that the utilitys costs associated with gas pipeline safety-related work could total between $350 million and $550 million for the year, compared with the prior estimated range of $200 million to $300 million.  Since the last quarter, the scope of the companys anticipated gas pipeline safety-related work has increased significantly.  Planned work now includes validating gas pipeline data for 1,800 miles of pipe and conducting hydrostatic pressure tests for more than 150 miles of pipe.
 
The estimated range for third-party liability remains unchanged at $0 to $180 million pre-tax.  This range is in addition to a $220 million provision booked in the third quarter of 2010, based on estimated third-party liability of $220 million to $400 million.  Guidance for 2011 does not reflect insurance recoveries, the majority of which may not be received until after 2011.
 
Guidance is based on various assumptions, including those discussed above, the approval of the settlement reached in the utilitys GRC, and capital spending consistent with the GRC settlement and other regulatory decisions.
 
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations.  Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
