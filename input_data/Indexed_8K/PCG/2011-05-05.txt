2011 General Rate Case Application
On May 5, 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted to approve a final decision in Pacific Gas and Electric Companys (the Utility) 2011 General Rate Case (GRC) to authorize the Utilitys revenue requirements for 2011 through 2013 for its costs to own and operate its electric and natural gas distribution and electric generation operations. The final decision approves the unopposed October 15, 2010 settlement agreement among the Utility, the CPUCs Division of Ratepayer Advocates, The Utility Reform Network, Aglet Consumer Alliance, and nearly all other intervening parties.  Based on the CPUCs decision, the Utilitys related 2011 revenues are projected to be approximately $3.2 billion for electric distribution, $1.1 billion for natural gas distribution, and $1.7 billion for electric generation operations.  This reflects an authorized increase in revenues of $450 million, including $55 million for the recovery of financing costs and the accelerated return of capital associated with conventional meters that have been replaced by SmartMeter devices.  The final decision also authorizes the Utility to request incremental revenue to recover state and federal income taxes related to the accelerated depreciation of the conventional meters.  The Utilitys request may not exceed a total of $15 million over the 2011-2013 GRC period.

The CPUC also authorized the following attrition increases that were proposed in the settlement agreement: an additional increase of $180 million to the authorized 2011 revenues in 2012 and an additional increase of $185 million in 2013.  The Utilitys rates will be adjusted for the remainder of 2011 to allow the Utility to recover the increase in authorized revenue requirements as of January 1, 2011.
As a result of the final decision, PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 will reflect the change in revenues from January 1, 2011.
