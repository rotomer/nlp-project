(SAN FRANCISCO)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called income available for common shareholders) was $362 million, or $0.91 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  This compares with $333 million, or $0.86 per share, for the same period last year.
 
Overall GAAP results reflect two regulatory decisions issued during the quarter that were retroactive to the beginning of the year, resulting in six months of revenue increases being reported in the second quarter.  The catch-up revenues associated with the first quarter account for $0.13 per share in the second quarter results.  The results also reflect costs of $76 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.11 per share, for gas pipeline-related actions in response to the San Bruno pipeline accident. This work includes reviewing pipeline records to validate maximum allowable operating pressures, performing hydrostatic pressure tests, and other actions. Since the San Bruno accident, the utility has incurred total costs of $189 million on a pre-tax basis associated with gas pipeline-related actions.
 
GAAP results for the quarter also include an additional provision for third-party liabilities associated with the San Bruno accident of $59 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per share, reflecting information from the mediation and litigation process regarding these claims.  (The aggregate provision for third-party liabilities now totals $279 million.)  In addition, the results reflect insurance recoveries of $60 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per share, representing payment by insurance carriers responsible for the first two levels of liability insurance coverage.
 
PG&Es focus continues to center on public safety and taking all steps that are necessary to improve PG&Es operating performance, said utility President Chris Johns. We continue to work and make progress on multiple fronts to address operating challenges and provide confidence in PG&Es gas system operations.  These efforts range from the hydrostatic pressure testing now under way on key pipelines to the comprehensive plan we expect to submit later this month regarding the longer-term upgrade and modernization of our pipeline system.
 
Earnings from Operations
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporations earnings from operations were $406 million, or $1.02 per share, for the second quarter of 2011.  During the same period last year, earnings from operations were $353 million, or $0.91 per share.  Earnings from operations exclude the costs incurred for gas pipeline-related actions, third-party liabilities, and insurance recoveries, which together are being treated as an item impacting comparability.
 
The approval during the quarter of the settlements in the General Rate Case and the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case primarily accounts for a $0.24 per share quarter-over-quarter increase for the combination of rate base earnings and expense recovery that were retroactive to the beginning of the year.
 
The increased revenues associated with the rate case decisions were partially offset by a number of items, including a regularly scheduled nuclear refueling outage at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant ($0.06 per share), lower gas transmission and storage revenues resulting from ongoing adverse market conditions ($0.02 per share), an increase in the number of PG&E Corporation common shares outstanding ($0.03 per share), and other factors (totaling $0.02 per share).
 
2011 Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation is maintaining 2011 guidance for earnings from operations (non-GAAP) of $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
 
Including the estimated amounts for the item impacting comparability related to gas pipeline matters, the range for projected earnings per share on a GAAP basis is $2.46 to $3.09 per share for 2011.  Costs associated with the utilitys gas pipeline-related actions are estimated at $350 million to $550 million for the year.  The estimated range for third-party liabilities, reflecting the mediation and litigation process to date, is now $59 million to $180 million for the year.  (This range is in addition to the $220 million provision for third-party liabilities booked in the third quarter of 2010.)  Also reflected in the estimated range for the item impacting comparability are the insurance recoveries of $60 million. Insurance recoveries are recognized only when deemed probable under applicable accounting standards.  The guidance range does not include any estimates of potential future insurance recoveries or potential future fines or penalties.
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations.  Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
