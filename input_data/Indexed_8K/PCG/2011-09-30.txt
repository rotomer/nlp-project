Item 8.01.  Other Events.
 
On September 29, 2011, a presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) of the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") denied a request to approve stipulations submitted by Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("Utility"), the CPUCs Consumer Protection and Safety Division (CPSD), and The Utility Reform Network, to resolve the CPUC's investigation of a natural gas explosion and fire that occurred on December 24, 2008 in a house located in Rancho Cordova, California (Rancho Cordova accident).  The explosion and fire resulted in one death, injuries to several people, and property damage. The presiding officers decision ("POD") recommends that the Utility pay a penalty of $38 million (instead of $26 million as had been originally proposed) based on the ALJ's determination that (1) CPUC case law warrants a higher penalty when a fatality has occurred and (2) the Utility could be fined as much as $97 million if the case were fully litigated and all allegations were proven. If all of the active parties file a motion within 30 days to accept the increased penalty amount, the ALJ will issue another POD formalizing the new penalty for CPUC consideration.  The POD also provides that if a motion is not filed, evidentiary hearings will be scheduled.  Alternatively, an appeal or request for review of this POD could be filed within 30 days.
 
 
As of June 30, 2011, approximately $27 million was accrued for penalties and other costs associated with the Rancho Cordova accident in PG&E Corporations and the Utilitys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
