(SAN FRANCISCO) - Outlining expectations for 2012 in conjunction with the release of its third quarter earnings, PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) announced it is taking additional actions to aggressively step up improvements in its gas and electric operations and customer service.
 
The company will commit significant additional resources to accelerate currently planned gas and electric system improvement work and initiate new efforts to achieve higher operating performance going forward. Among the actions PG&E will take are completing targeted inspection and maintenance work earlier than originally planned, hiring and training new talent in key areas including gas control, and increasing hands-on support for small and medium-size business customers.
 
Fundamentally improving operations and customer service is vital to restoring trust and confidence in PG&E and returning us to the front ranks of the industry in the coming years, said Tony Earley, PG&E Corporation Chairman, CEO and President. This plan of action is the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders, and its critical to PG&Es long term success.
 
As the company moves forward with these initiatives, earnings in 2012 and 2013 will be negatively impacted. Expenses for this work in 2012 are expected to be approximately $200 million above what the company expects to recover through rates (see further discussion on earnings guidance below). Comparable levels of additional spending are expected in 2013.
 
Also, for the second year in a row, investors will forgo a regular dividend increase pending resolution of key issues related to the utility's natural gas pipeline operations.
 
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter GAAP Results
 
PG&E Corporations net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called "income available for common shareholders") was $200 million, or $0.50 per share, for the third quarter, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with $258 million, or $0.66 per share, for the same quarter in 2010.
 
GAAP results reflect costs associated with ongoing natural gas pipeline-related actions as well as two substantial charges in the quarter, described below.
 
The natural gas pipeline-related costs during the third quarter totaled $177 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.26 per share, most significantly for ongoing work to validate safe pipeline operating pressures and conduct extensive strength testing. Since the San Bruno natural gas pipeline accident, the utility has incurred total costs of $366 million on a pre-tax basis associated with natural gas pipeline-related actions, such as strength testing and pressure validation.
 
The company also recorded an additional provision for third-party liability associated with the San Bruno accident of $96 million pre-tax, or $0.14 per share, reflecting updated information about the claims and its experience to date in resolving key cases. (The aggregate provision for third-party liability now totals $375 million pre-tax.) PG&E continues to expect that a significant portion of its third-party liability will ultimately be recovered through insurance.
 
Third quarter GAAP results also included a $125 million pre-tax provision, or $0.18 per share, for additional estimated environmental-related costs associated with historic natural gas compressor station operations in Hinkley, California. The provision reflects new environmental data at the remediation site as well as recent orders by local officials, and includes estimates for higher potential remediation costs and costs to provide replacement water.
 
Earnings from Operations
 
On a non-GAAP basis, PG&E Corporation's earnings from operations were $436 million, or $1.08 per share, for the third quarter of 2011. During the same period last year, earnings from operations were $398 million, or $1.02 per share. Earnings from operations exclude the costs incurred for natural gas pipeline-related actions, third-party liability costs and environmental charges discussed above, which are being treated as items impacting comparability.
 
 
 
 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share from operations primarily reflects higher authorized revenues stemming from increased capital investments in PG&Es system. This positive effect was partially offset by an increase in the provision for the fine associated with a 2009 natural gas-related accident and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding.
 
2011 Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation is maintaining 2011 guidance for earnings from operations (non-GAAP) in the range of $3.45 to $3.60 per share.
 
On a GAAP basis, including the estimated amounts for the items impacting comparability related to gas pipeline matters and environmental-related costs, the range for projected earnings per share is now $1.99 to $2.77 per share for 2011.
 
Estimates for natural gas pipeline-related actions in 2011 remain in the range of $350 million to $550 million pre-tax. However, the company has revised its estimated range for third-party liability costs related to the San Bruno accident to between $375 million and $600 million pre-tax. Excluding the $220 million liability provision recorded in 2010, the range for 2011 is now $155 million to $380 million pre-tax.
 
Estimated insurance recoveries related to the San Bruno accident reflect actual recoveries to date of $60 million. Insurance recoveries are recognized only when deemed probable under applicable accounting standards. The guidance range does not include any estimates of potential future insurance recoveries or potential future fines and penalties.
 
2012 Earnings Guidance
 
The company is initiating guidance for 2012 earnings from operations in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Guidance reflects the expected increased costs, estimated to be approximately $200 million pre-tax in 2012, associated with the targeted improvements in operations and customer service outlined above.
 
On a GAAP basis, guidance for 2012 is projected at $2.36 to $3.16 per share and reflects the items impacting comparability related to natural gas pipeline matters and environmental-related costs. Costs for pipeline-related actions outside the scope of PG&Es proposed Pipeline Safety
 
 
 
 
Enhancement Plan for which PG&E is not seeking recovery are estimated at $100 million to $200 million pre-tax for the year.
 
Third-party liability is estimated at $0 to $225 million pre-tax for the year. This reflects the difference between the upper end of the companys estimated range for third-party liability associated with the San Bruno accident of $600 million and the $375 million already accrued to date. GAAP guidance also reflects an estimate of potential additional environmental-related costs of $0 to $100 million pre-tax.
 
As in 2011, guidance does not include any estimates of potential future insurance recoveries, fines, penalties or punitive damages. It also assumes that the California Public Utilities Commission approves the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan and the associated cost allocation and ratemaking proposals as filed. In addition, it assumes PG&E Corporation will issue approximately $600 million of common stock through the end of 2012.
 
Guidance is based on various assumptions, including those described above. Other assumptions include future capital expenditures, rate base, and allowed return.
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on "earnings from operations" in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).
