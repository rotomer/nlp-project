           (San Francisco)  PG&E Corporations (NYSE: PCG) full-year 2011 net income after dividends on preferred stock (also called income available for common shareholders) was $844 million, or $2.10 per share, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This compares with $1.1 billion, or $2.82 per share, for the full year 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011, GAAP results were $0.20 per share, compared with $0.63 per share for the same quarter in 2010.
 
GAAP results include items that management does not consider part of normal, ongoing operations (items impacting comparability), which totaled $861 million pre-tax, or $1.48 per share, for the full year and $339 million pre-tax, or $0.69 per share, for the fourth quarter. The items impacting comparability relate to natural gas matters (natural gas pipeline-related costs, penalties, third-party liability claims, and insurance recoveries) and environmental costs.
 
Enhancing the safety and performance of our operations continues to be our top priority, said Tony Earley, Chairman, CEO and President of PG&E Corporation. In keeping with that focus, our new gas operations organization made significant strides in 2011 completing extensive pipeline testing and other safety-related work, much of which was unprecedented in its scope and rigor. While much of our work in 2011 addressed past operating and records issues, our gas pipeline initiatives in 2012 are aimed primarily at meeting the substantial new safety requirements that California has adopted for the future. We expect that PG&E will be among the first utilities in the country to meet the new standards in the years ahead.
 
Costs for natural gas pipeline-related actions in 2011 were absorbed by shareholders and were the largest item impacting comparability reflected in 2011 GAAP results. This consisted of extensive work to validate safe pipeline operating pressures and conduct strength testing, as well as
legal and other expenses related to the San Bruno pipeline accident. Costs totaled $483 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.72 per share, for the full year and $180 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.26 per share, for the fourth quarter. Since the September 2010 accident, the utility has incurred, at shareholders expense, a total of $546 million pre-tax for natural gas pipeline-related actions.
 
GAAP results for 2011 also reflect a fourth-quarter accrual of $200 million ($0.50 per share for the year and $0.49 per share for the quarter) for potential penalties regulators are expected to levy in connection with gas matters. The accrual takes into account a number of recent regulatory developments.
 
Annual GAAP results also reflect an accrual of $155 million pre-tax, or $0.23 per share, for third-party liability associated with the San Bruno accident. No additional accruals for third-party liability were taken in the fourth quarter. For 2010 and 2011 combined, the total provision for third-party liability is $375 million. PG&E continues to expect that a significant portion of its third-party liability will ultimately be recovered through insurance. Insurance recoveries related to third-party liability totaled $99 million pre-tax, or $0.15 per share, for the year and $39 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per share, for the fourth quarter.
 
Finally, GAAP results also reflect a $125 million pre-tax provision, or $0.18 per share, booked in the third quarter for estimated environmental-related costs associated with historic natural gas compressor station operations in Hinkley, California.
 
Full-Year and Fourth Quarter Earnings from Operations
 
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding items impacting comparability, PG&E Corporation's earnings from operations in 2011 were $1.44 billion, or $3.58 per share, compared with $1.33 billion, or $3.42 per share, in 2010.
 
For the fourth quarter, earnings from operations were $366 million, or $0.89 per share. During the same period in 2010, earnings from operations were $277 million, or $0.70 per share. The quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share from operations primarily reflects higher revenues stemming from increased capital investments in PG&Es system, as authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission. In addition, absent from fourth quarter results in 2011 were several items that negatively affected results for the same period in 2010, including a refueling at
Diablo Canyon Power Plant. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in the number of common shares outstanding and other items.
 
2012 Earnings Guidance
 
PG&E Corporation is maintaining previously issued guidance for 2012 earnings from operations in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 per share.
 
On a GAAP basis, 2012 guidance is being updated to include the costs of the utilitys proposed Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan (PSEP), given uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of regulatory approval. All costs in the PSEP for which PG&E is seeking recovery are for work necessary to meet newly adopted pipeline safety requirements going forward. PG&E is not seeking recovery of costs to address past operational and records-related issues and other work outside the scope of the PSEP.
 
Previous GAAP guidance for 2012 assumed recovery of all PSEP costs (originally estimated at $230 million pre-tax) as filed and, therefore, included only pipeline-related work outside the scope of the PSEP. The previous range for these non-PSEP costs was $100 million to $200 million pre-tax. The updated range includes both PSEP and non-PSEP costs and reflects an aggregate increase in expected costs of $120 million pre-tax based on the companys experience with pipeline-related work during 2011. The updated range for all pipeline-related work is $450 million to $550 million pre-tax.
 
GAAP guidance is unchanged for third-party liability claims associated with the San Bruno accident. The estimate for third-party liability remains $0 to $225 million pre-tax for the year, representing the difference between the upper end of the companys estimated range for third-party liability of $600 million and the $375 million already accrued to date. GAAP guidance is also unchanged for potential additional environmental-related costs. The estimate for environmental-related costs remains $0 to $100 million pre-tax for the year.
 
The resulting range for 2012 GAAP guidance is now $1.88 to $2.67 per share, compared with the previous range of $2.36 to $3.16 per share.
 
As in 2011, guidance does not include any potential future insurance recoveries or penalties (other than those already accrued) or any potential punitive damages. In addition, it assumes PG&E Corporation will issue approximately $600 million of common stock in 2012. Guidance is based on
various assumptions, including those described above. Other assumptions include future operating expenses, capital expenditures, authorized rate base and allowed return.
 
PG&E Corporation discloses historical financial results and provides guidance based on earnings from operations in order to provide a measure that allows investors to compare the underlying financial performance of the business from one period to another, exclusive of items that management believes do not reflect the normal course of operations. Earnings from operations are not a substitute or alternative for consolidated net income presented in accordance with GAAP (see the accompanying tables for a reconciliation of results and guidance based on earnings from operations to results and guidance based on consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP).

During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, PG&E Corporations subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) incurred net costs of $283 million and $520 million, after-tax, respectively, in connection with natural gas matters.  These amounts included pipeline-related costs to review records, validate operating pressures, conduct hydrostatic pressure tests, inspect pipelines, and perform other activities associated with safety improvements to the Utilitys natural gas pipeline system to comply with orders issued by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) following the rupture of one of the Utilitys natural gas transmission pipelines in San Bruno, California on September 9, 2010 (the San Bruno accident).  These amounts also included a provision for the minimum amount of reasonably estimable penalties deemed probable of being imposed on the Utility in connection with the CPUCs pending investigations and the Utilitys self-reported violations regarding natural gas operating practices.  In addition, these amounts included an increase in the provision for estimated third-party claims related to the San Bruno accident, reflecting new information regarding the nature of claims filed against the Utility, experience to date resolving cases, and developments in the litigation and regulatory proceedings.  Costs incurred for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 were partially offset by insurance recoveries.

The range includes pipeline-related costs associated with the increased scope of work that the Utility expects to undertake on its natural gas pipeline system, as well as any additional provision for third-party claims.
 
(a)
 
The pipeline-related cost range of $450 million to $550 million includes costs associated with regulatory and legal proceedings and other gas pipeline costs that may not be recoverable through rates. Although the Utility has requested the CPUC to authorize the Utility to recover certain costs it incurs in 2012 and future years under its proposed pipeline safety enhancement plan, it is uncertain what portion of these costs will be recoverable and when such costs will be recovered.
 
(b)
Although the Utility believes the ultimate amount of penalties could be materially higher than amounts accrued as of December 31, 2011, losses for penalties are recognized only when deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated under applicable accounting standards.
 
(c)
 The range for third-party claims in 2012 is in addition to the cumulative provision of $375 million recorded as of December 31, 2011.
 
 Although the Utility considers it likely that a significant portion of the costs it incurs for third-party claims will be covered through its insurance, insurance recoveries are recognized only when deemed probable under applicable accounting standards.
(d)
 
 As in 2011, guidance does not include any potential future insurance recoveries or penalties (other than those already accrued) or any potential punitive damages.

The estimate depends primarily on the outcome of a final groundwater remediation plan and other related activities associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site.
