Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
               On March 12, 2012, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Utility) and PG&E Corporation agreed with the City of San Bruno, California (City) to resolve and settle the Citys claims arising out of the tragic September 9, 2010 pipeline accident in San Bruno (San Bruno accident).  Under this settlement agreement, the Utility agreed to contribute $70 million to the City for contribution to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit, public purpose entity for the benefit of the City and its residents. (The Utility will not seek to recover the contribution through insurance or customer rates.)  This $70 million contribution is guaranteed by PG&E Corporation.  This settlement is in addition to the Utilitys previous agreement that it will advance funds to, and indemnify and reimburse, the City for costs the City has incurred in connection with the San Bruno accident.  Other than these obligations and each partys right to participate in regulatory and legislative proceedings, the City has released the Utility and PG&E Corporation from all other claims, demands or damages relating to the San Bruno accident. 
At December 31, 2011, PG&E Corporation and the Utilitys financial statements reflected a cumulative charge of $375 million ($155 million in 2011 and $220 million in 2010) for third-party claims related to the San Bruno accident and estimated that it was reasonably possible that additional losses of $225 million could be incurred, for a total possible loss of $600 million. PG&E Corporation and the Utility will consider the settlement agreement and other relevant developments when reassessing the estimated range of third-party liability relating to the San Bruno accident in connection with the preparation of their financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
