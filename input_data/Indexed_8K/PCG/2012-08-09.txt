Item 8.01. Other Events
As reported in the Annual Reports of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the Utility) for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) operating license for the Utilitys Diablo Canyon Unit 1 expires in November 2024 and the operating license for Diablo Canyon Unit 2 expires in August 2025.  The Utility is currently planning to conduct updated seismological mapping near the Diablo Canyon plant.  The Utility estimates that this mapping effort and the resulting seismological analysis will not be completed until 2013 or 2014, at which time it can proceed with the license renewal process.
 
In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the NRCs updated Waste Confidence Decision, finding that it violated the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement be prepared.  The court remanded that rulemaking to the NRC for further consideration.  The Waste Confidence Decision is a determination by the NRC that spent nuclear fuel can be safely managed until a permanent off-site repository is established.  By order dated August 7, 2012, the NRC stated that, while licensing reviews and proceedings should continue to move forward, it will not issue final licensing decisions until it has appropriately addressed the courts decision.
 
While the Utility does not currently expect the NRCs action to lengthen the processing time of its license renewal application, the Utility is unable to predict the ultimate impact on the processing of its application.
