DATED: April 1, 2005

Exhibit 2.1
        THIS REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into this 28th day of March, 2005, by and between Soterra LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, whose street address is 439A Katherine Drive, Flowood, Mississippi 39232, and whose mailing address is Post Office Box 18, Jackson, MS 39205 (hereinafter "Seller"), and Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership whose address is 999 Third Avenue, Suite 4300, Seattle, Washington 98104 ("Purchaser").
        The parties agree to the following terms and conditions:
    1.        .
Timberlands and Other Property to be Acquired
        1.1 In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, and subject to all terms of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell and convey to the Purchaser and the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Seller and take title to the following:
Description of Assets.
        1.2 The Property, Contracts, Access Rights and Easements and Personal Property are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Assets." Before Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets (land, timber, and personal property) and shall utilize the agreed upon allocation for all income tax purposes for this transaction.
Assets.
        2.       .
Purchase Price
    3.              . Purchaser hereby deposits with the escrow described in Paragraph 4 herein, the amount of One Million Twenty Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty-Nine Dollars ($1,020,939.00), in cash, paid or delivered as earnest money (together with any interest earned thereon, the "Earnest Money") being 2% of the Purchase Price.
Earnest Money Receipt
    4.              .
Time and Place of Phased Closings; Escrow
    5.        .
Condition of Title and Title Insurance
Furthermore, any title encumbrances or exceptions that are set forth in the title commitment to which Purchaser does not object during the Title Review Period (as may be extended with respect to missing documents as described above) shall be deemed to be permitted exceptions to the status of Seller's title (together with the items listed above shall be the "Permitted Exceptions"). With regard to items to which Purchaser does object in writing within the period specified, Seller shall attempt to cure and remove such items. If Seller is unable or fails to cure or remove such items within ten (10) business days of Seller's receipt of Purchaser's written objections, Purchaser may either: (i) waive its objection and proceed with closing of the affected tract or parcel; or, (ii) give Seller notice to delete the affected tract or parcel and adjust the Purchase Price as set forth herein. Any notice to Seller shall be in writing and shall be given no later than five (5) business days after expiration of Seller's 10-day cure period. If Purchaser fails to give such notice to Seller within the time specified, the objection(s) shall be deemed waived by the Purchaser. The value of any adjustment to the Purchase Price will be determined by a computation of the number of acres utilizing the specific values reflected on the chart attached hereto as and incorporated herein by this reference as though fully set forth. Any such excluded acreage shall be aggregated with such surrounding acreage not to exceed forty (40) acres unless the excluded tract exceeds forty (40) acres or Seller establishes that a larger tract is reasonably necessary to create an economically marketable parcel, as reasonably determined by Seller and Purchaser. In the event Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the specific acreage to be excluded, the parties agree to resolve the dispute through arbitration with Larson & McGowan, Inc. making a final determination as sole arbitrator, to which the parties agree to be bound. The parties shall close as scheduled on the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, adjusting the purchase price by the disputed amount, escrowing the disputed amount and close on the disputed amount and Property upon the conclusion of arbitration (the "Arbitration Process"). In the event of any such carve-outs, Seller shall reserve or Purchaser shall grant such rights for ingress, egress and utilities as may be required to access such parcel. For the purposes of all adjustments to Purchase Price arising out of title claims or defects and environmental claims or defects, Purchaser shall not be entitled to request and obtain an adjustment to the Purchase Price until the claims, or defects, arising from title and environmental claims or defects individually or collectively could lessen the value of the Assets by, or cause damage of, at least six/tenths of onepercent (0.6%) of the Purchase Price (the "Floor"). If title or environmental claims individually or in the aggregate do not exceed the Floor, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price. If title or environmental claims exceed the Floor, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted for title and environmental claims by reducing the Purchase Price by the amount of the claims above the Floor subject to the Ceiling for claims of ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price ("Title and Environmental Claim Ceiling"). If the total title and environmental claims exceed the Claim Ceiling, either Seller or Purchaser may terminate this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser with neither Seller nor Purchaser having any further liability to each other.

        12.2.        .
Closing Instruments
        12.3 . Property taxes for the current year, assessments, rents, water and other utilities constituting liens and applicable Temporary Encumbrances shall be pro-rated as of Closing. Seller shall be responsible for the payment in full of all taxes for all periods prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment in full of all taxes for all periods subsequent to Closing. Purchaser shall be responsible for all of the roll-back or other taxes, if any, (whenever assessed against Purchaser or Seller) imposed as a result of any change of use by Purchaser or Purchaser's assignee in title.
Pro Rations and Post-Closing Taxes
    13.        . Purchaser and Seller each represent and warrant to the other that no broker, agent or finder, licensed or otherwise has been engaged by it, respectively, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any such claim for broker's, agent's or finder's fee or commission in connection with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this transaction, the party upon whose alleged statement, representation or agreement such claim or liability arises shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other party from and against such claim and liability, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that the representations and warranties contained in this Paragraph shall survive the Closing.

    14.        . Unless a different date is provided for herein, the Purchaser, subject to the easements, encumbrances, exceptions, restrictions, and reservations set forth above, shall be entitled to possession of the Property on the Closing Date.
Possession

Default
        Purchaser acknowledges that if Purchaser fails to purchase the Property so as to constitute a default by Purchaser hereunder, for any reason other than the breach of Seller, Seller shall be entitled to compensation from Purchaser (as its sole remedy) for the detriment resulting from the removal of the Property from the market, and entering into this Agreement rather than selling to other potential purchasers. Therefore, in the event of Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property so as to constitute Purchaser's default hereunder, Seller shall have, as Seller's exclusive option, the right to receive and retain the Earnest Money as liquidated damages and not a penalty, which sum shall represent liquidated damages for breach and not a penalty therefore. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Earnest Money is presently a reasonable estimate of Seller's damages, considering all of the circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to Seller that reasonably could be anticipated and the expectation that proof of actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult. Factors taken into consideration by the parties include Seller's loss of opportunity during the pendency of this Agreement to sell the Property to others on better terms, or at a higher price; Seller's risk of loss of a bargain if the market turns negative; Seller's damages related to its continuing obligations for the payment of taxes and insurance; and Seller's loss of earnings on the amount of the purchase price resulting from a delay in closing. Purchaser hereby waives all rights or benefits of any law, rule or regulation, now or hereafter existing, which would allow Purchaser, following Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property so as to constitute Purchaser's default, to claim a refund of the Earnest Money as unearned Earnest Money, a penalty or for any other purpose.
    16.        . If either party hereto is required to retain an attorney to enforce any provision of this Agreement, whether or not a legal proceeding is commenced, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees regardless of whether at trial, on appeal, in any bankruptcy proceeding, in an arbitration or without resort to suit.
Attorneys' Fees
    17.        . This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Florida.
Governing Law
    18.        . Subject to the requirements of any applicable statute, any notices required or permitted by law or under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) personally delivered, (ii) sent by first class certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid, or (iii) dispatched by facsimile transmission (accompanied with reasonable evidence of receipt of transmission and with a confirmation copy mailed no later than the day after transmission) to the parties' addresses set forth below. Either party may change such address for notice. All notices which are so addressed and paid for shall be deemed effective when personally delivered, or, if mailed, on the earlier of receipt or five (5) days after deposit thereof in the U.S. mail; or if sent via facsimile, the date upon which such facsimile was transmitted and confirmation of such transmission has been received. Notices shall be addressed as follows:

Time of Performance

Paragraph Headings
    21.        . In the event any portion of this Agreement should be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof unless the court's ruling includes a determination that the principal purpose and intent of this Agreement are thereby defeated.
Invalidity
    22.        . The parties to this Agreement execute the same solely as a seller and a purchaser. No partnership, joint venture or joint undertaking shall be construed from these presents, and except as herein specifically provided, neither party shall have the right to make any representation for, act on behalf of, or be liable for the debts of the other. All terms, covenants and conditions to be observed and performed by either of the parties hereto shall be joint and several if entered into by more than one person on behalf of such party, and a default by any one or more of such persons shall be deemed a default on the part of the party with whom said person or persons are identified. No third party is intended to be benefited by this Agreement.
Legal Relationships
    23.        . Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 30, Purchaser may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or encumber its interest in this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller, which may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion. Subject to the restrictions contained herein, the rights and obligations of the Seller and Purchaser shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon their respective estates, heirs, executors administrators, successors, successors-in-trust and assigns.
Assignment; Successors
    24.        . All understandings and agreements previously existing between the parties, if any, are merged into this Agreement, which alone fully and completely expresses their agreement, and the same is entered into after full investigation, neither party relying upon any statement or representation made by the other not embodied herein.

With regard to items to which Purchaser does object in writing within the period specified, Seller shall attempt to cure and remove such items. If Seller is unable or fails to cure or remove such items within ten (10) business days of Seller's receipt of Purchaser's written objections, Purchaser may either: (i) waive its objection and proceed with closing of the affected tract or parcel; or, (ii) give Seller notice to delete the affected tract or parcel and adjust the Purchase Price as set forth herein. Any notice to Seller shall be in writing and shall be given no later than five (5) business days after expiration of Seller's 10-day cure period. If Purchaser fails to give such notice to Seller within the time specified, the objection(s) shall be deemed waived by the Purchaser. The value of any adjustment to the Purchase Price will be determined by a computation of the number of acres utilizing the specific values reflected on the chart attached hereto as and incorporated herein by this reference as though fully set forth. Any such excluded acreage shall be aggregated with such surrounding acreage not to exceed forty (40) acres unless the excluded tract exceeds forty (40) acres or Seller establishes that a larger tract is reasonably necessary to create an economically marketable parcel, as reasonably determined by Seller and Purchaser. In the event Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the specific acreage to be excluded, the parties agree to resolve the dispute through arbitration with Larson & McGowan, Inc. making a final determination as sole arbitrator, to which the parties agree to be bound. The parties shall close as scheduled on the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, adjusting the purchase price by the disputed amount, escrowing the disputed amount and close on the disputed amount and Property upon the conclusion of arbitration (the "Arbitration Process"). In the event of any such carve-outs, Seller shall reserve or Purchaser shall grant such rights for ingress, egress and utilities as may be required to access such parcel. For the purposes of all adjustments to Purchase Price arising out of title claims or defects and environmental claims or defects, Purchaser shall not be entitled to request and obtain an adjustment to the Purchase Price until the claims, or defects, arising from title and environmental claims or defects individually or collectively could lessen the value of the Assets by, or cause damage of, at least six/tenths of onepercent (0.6%) of the Purchase Price of each tract (the "Floor"). If title or environmental claims individually or in the aggregate do not exceed the Floor, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price. If title or environmental claims exceed the Floor, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted for title and environmental claims by reducing the Purchase Price by the amount of the claims above the Floor subject to the Ceiling for claims of ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price of each tract ("Title and Environmental Claim Ceiling"). If the total title and environmental claims exceed the Claim Ceiling, either Seller or Purchaser may terminate this Agreement, the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser with neither Seller nor Purchaser having any further liability to each other.

Environmental Matters.
        Subject to Seller's warranty set forth in this Paragraph 7.7, the liability for which Seller remains responsible pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser releases Seller, its parent company and affiliates (for the purposes of this paragraph "Seller") from all costs, losses, liabilities, obligations and claims, of any nature whatsoever, known and unknown, that Purchaser may have against Seller or that may arise after the date of Closing based in whole or in part upon (i) Seller's failure to comply with any environmental laws applicable to the Assets; or (ii) the presence, release or disposal of any hazardous substance, solid waste, or any other environmental contamination on, within, or from the Assets before, as of, or after the Closing Date.

Seller shall be responsible for the payment in full of all taxes for all periods prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment in full of all taxes for all periods subsequent to each Closing for the applicable tract. Purchaser shall be responsible for all of the roll-back or other taxes, if any, (whenever assessed against Purchaser or Seller) imposed as a result of any change of use by Purchaser or Purchaser's assignee in title.
Pro Rations and Post-Closing Taxes
    13.        . Purchaser and Seller each represent and warrant to the other that no broker, agent or finder, licensed or otherwise has been engaged by it, respectively, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any such claim for broker's, agent's or finder's fee or commission in connection with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this transaction, the party upon whose alleged statement, representation or agreement such claim or liability arises shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other party from and against such claim and liability, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that the representations and warranties contained in this Paragraph shall survive the Closing.
Commission
    14.        . Unless a different date is provided for herein, the Purchaser, subject to the easements, encumbrances, exceptions, restrictions, and reservations set forth above, shall be entitled to possession of the Property described in each tract on the Closing Date for that tract.
Possession
    15.        . If Seller defaults (that is, fails to perform the acts required of it) in its contractual performance herein, Purchaser shall be entitled to (i) a return of the Earnest Money; and (ii) the right to seek specific performance pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Default
        Purchaser acknowledges that if Purchaser fails to purchase the Property so as to constitute a default by Purchaser hereunder, for any reason other than the breach of Seller, Seller shall be entitled to compensation from Purchaser (as its sole remedy) for the detriment resulting from the removal of the Property from the market, and entering into this Agreement rather than selling to other potential purchasers. Therefore, in the event of Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property so as to constitute Purchaser's default hereunder, Seller shall have, as Seller's exclusive option, the right to receive and retain the Earnest Money (or the remaining portion thereof) as liquidated damages and not a penalty, which sum shall represent liquidated damages for breach and not a penalty therefore. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Earnest Money in total and as allocated 25% each to each tract is presently a reasonable estimate of Seller's damages, considering all of the circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to Seller that reasonably could be anticipated and the expectation that proof of actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult. Factors taken into consideration by the parties include Seller's loss of opportunity during the pendency of this Agreement to sell the Property to others on better terms, or at a higher price; Seller's risk of loss of a bargain if the market turns negative; Seller's damages related to its continuing obligations for the payment of taxes and insurance; and Seller's loss of earnings on the amount of the purchase price resulting from a delay in closing. Purchaser hereby waives all rights or benefits of any law, rule or regulation, now or hereafter existing, which would allow Purchaser, following Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property so as to constitute Purchaser's default, to claim a refund of the Earnest Money (or remaining portion thereof) as unearned Earnest Money, a penalty or for any other purpose.
    16.        . If either party hereto is required to retain an attorney to enforce any provision of this Agreement, whether or not a legal proceeding is commenced, the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees regardless of whether at trial, on appeal, in any bankruptcy proceeding, in an arbitration or without resort to suit.
Attorneys' Fees
    17.        . This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Florida.

All terms, covenants and conditions to be observed and performed by either of the parties hereto shall be joint and several if entered into by more than one person on behalf of such party, and a default by any one or more of such persons shall be deemed a default on the part of the party with whom said person or persons are identified. No third party is intended to be benefited by this Agreement.
Legal Relationships
    23.        . Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 30, Purchaser may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or encumber its interest in this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Assignment; Successors
    24.        .
