Item 2.03  Creation of Direct Financial Obligation Or Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On April 25, 2006, Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P. (the "Partnership") and Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (the "Company" and, together with the Partnership, the "Issuers") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Underwriter"), pursuant to which the Underwriter agreed to purchase from the Partnership $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Notes due 2015 (the "Additional Notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Additional Notes, the "Securities"). The Additional Notes will form a part of the same series as, and are fungible with, the Partnership's outstanding 5.875% Notes due 2015 originally issued as of November 14, 2005 in the principal amount of $300,000,000 (the "Initial Notes" and, together with the Additional Notes, the "Notes"). Upon completion of the offering of the Additional Notes, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes will be $525,000,000. The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated November 14, 2005, by and among the Partnership, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by an Officer's Certificate, dated November 14, 2005 and an Officer's Certificate, dated May 2, 2006 (the "Certificates"). The Issuers expect the sale of the Securities to close on May 2, 2006.
 
The Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.875% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2006. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2015. The Partnership may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the redemption date, plus, a make-whole amount, as specified in the Indenture. The Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership and will rank equally with all of the Partnership's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Indenture will limit the ability of the Partnership and its restricted subsidiaries from incurring certain secured debt and entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions and will limit the Partnership's ability to consolidate, merger or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions.
 
The Guarantees by the Company will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Company has no material assets other than its investment in the Partnership. The Partnership is indirectly wholly-owned by the Company.
 
The public offering price of the Notes was 96.686% of the principal amount. The Partnership expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $216.0 million (plus accrued interest on the Additional Notes from November 14, 2005) and to use such net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness.
 
The Securities were offered and sold pursuant to the Issuers' automatic shelf registration statements on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-133515 and 333-133515-01) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which became effective on April 25, 2006. The Issuers have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a prospectus supplement, dated April 25, 2006, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated April 25, 2006, relating to the offering and sale of the Securities.
 
For complete description of the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, the Certificate and the Notes please refer to the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, the Certificates and the forms of Notes, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, respectively.
 
The Underwriter and its affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking and general financing services for the
Issuers, including as a participant in the Issuers' credit facilities, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

(b)           The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Operating Partnership or the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Operating Partnership and the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of the Operating Partnership, the Company, Directors and Officers.
 
(c)           Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, upon providing notice thereof to the indemnified party, an indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such action and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving the notice required under the first sentence hereof, assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it (provided that such counsel is approved, in their reasonable discretion, by the indemnified parties who are defendants in such action) unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. In the absence of such an election by an indemnifying party within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice to assume the defense of such an action or, in the event of a failure to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable period of time, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Sections 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Underwriter, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the
Actions against Parties; Notification.
indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)           Subject to Section 6(c), if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.
 
SECTION 7.           . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Operating Partnership and the total underwriting discount
received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Operating Partnership or the Company or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Operating Partnership, the Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Operating Partnership or the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Operating Partnership or the Company, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 8.           . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers or other representatives of the Operating Partnership or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Operating Partnership or the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriter.

SECTION 9.           .
Termination of Agreement
 
(a)           The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Operating Partnership and the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, any Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Underwriter, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Operating Partnership or the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or the Pacific Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either U.S. Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General.
 
(b)           If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

Company, Inc. Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), and Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with Partnership, the "Issuers"), in connection with the public offering of $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Partnership's 5.875% Notes due 2015 (the "Debt Securities"), guaranteed by the Company (the "Guarantees", together with the Debt Securities, the "Securities"), issuable pursuant to an indenture dated November 14, 2004 (the "Indenture"), among the Partnership, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Issuers entered into a Purchase Agreement, dated April 25, 2006 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Underwriter"), relating to the sale by the Issuers to the Underwriters of the Securities.
 
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
 
In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
 
(i)
           
the registration statements on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-133515 and 333-133515-01) of the Company and the Partnership, respectively, relating to the Securities and other securities of the Issuers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (such registration statements, as so amended and declared effective by the Commission on April 25, 2006, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement");
 
(ii)
          
the certificates evidencing the Securities;
 
(iii)
         
an executed copy of the Indenture;
 
(iv)
         
the certificate of William R. Brown, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated the date hereof, setting forth the terms of the Securities issued under the Indenture;
 
(v)
          
an executed copy of the Purchase Agreement;
 
(vi)
         
the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, as certified by Anna L. Oswald, Assistant Secretary of the Company;
 
(vii)
        
the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, as certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;
 
(viii)
       
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;
 
(ix)
          
the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company, as certified by Anna L. Oswald, Assistant Secretary of the Company; and
 
(x)
           
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, adopted on April 25, 2006, as certified by Anna L. Oswald, Assistant Secretary of the Company.
 
We also have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Issuers and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Issuers and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Partnership and the Company, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have also assumed that the execution and delivery by the Partnership and the Company of the Indenture, the Debt Securities and the Guarantees, as applicable, and the performance by the Partnership and the Company of their respective obligations thereunder, as applicable, do not
and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Partnership or the Company or any of their respective properties is subject, (ii) any law, rule, or regulation to which the Partnership or the Company or any of their properties is subject, (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with any governmental authority. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Issuers and others and of public officials.
 
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
 
(a)
                                 
the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
 
(b)
                                
we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on each of the Securities or any transactions contemplated thereby;
 
(c)
                                 
we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); and
 
(d)
                                
to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any agreement or instrument, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law 5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.
 
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to Delaware partnership law, the Delaware corporate law and the laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are applicable to transactions of the type covered by the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents,
approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non-opined-on law on the opinions herein which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
 
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
The Debt Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Partnership, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Partnership entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Partnership in accordance with their terms.
1.
                                      
 
The Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Company and when the Debt Securities are issued and delivered by the Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Guarantees will constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2.
                                      
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable law.
