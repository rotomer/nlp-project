Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
(a) On August 18, 2008, Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P. (the "Partnership"), a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (the "Company"), and its private senior note lenders executed an amendment to certain terms of its senior note agreements governing the terms of approximately $1.05 billion of its privately placed senior notes (collectively, the "Note Agreements"). The amendment includes a change that allows the Partnership to include a greater amount of proceeds from higher value timberland dispositions in the calculation of its debt incurrence test, reflecting the increase in this portion of the Company's business activities. The amendment also includes an exception to various restrictions in the Note Agreements on investments by the Partnership that allows the Partnership to contribute timberland assets to joint ventures with third parties, subject to certain specified conditions. The amendment also provides for the Partnership to pay a fee of 0.75% per annum of the outstanding principal amount of its privately placed senior notes to its private senior note lenders in the event that the Partnership's published debt rating is below investment grade (as defined). The Partnership would no longer be obligated to pay this fee once its debt rating returned to investment grade.
For a complete description of the terms and conditions of the amendment to the Note Agreements, please refer to the First Omnibus Amendment dated as of August 18, 2008 between the Partnership and the lenders party thereto, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 4.1.
