The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.70% per year. Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on March 15, 2021. The Partnership may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the redemption date, plus a make-whole amount if the redemption occurs prior to December 15, 2020, as specified in the Indenture. Additionally, upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Partnership or the Company and a below investment grade debt rating, the Partnership would be required to redeem the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the repurchase date.
The Notes will be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Partnership and will rank equally with all of the Partnership's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Indenture places certain limitations on the ability of the Partnership and its restricted subsidiaries from incurring secured debt, entering into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidating, merging or selling all or substantially all of its assets. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions.
The Guarantees by the Company will be an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Company has no material assets other than its direct and indirect investments in the Partnership.
The public offering price of the Notes was 99.933% of the principal amount. The Partnership expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $570 million and to use such net proceeds primarily to repay a portion of certain outstanding indebtedness.
The Securities were offered and sold pursuant to the Issuers' automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Nos. 333-158775 and 333-158775-01) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (which, in the case of legal expenses, must be reasonable), as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based, in each case, upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Operating Partnership and the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c), the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Operating Partnership and the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Operating Partnership, the Company, the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Operating Partnership or the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Operating Partnership and the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of the Operating Partnership, the Company, Directors and Officers.
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, upon providing notice thereof to the indemnified party, an indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in such action and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving the notice required under the first sentence hereof, assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it (provided that such counsel is approved, in their reasonable discretion, by the indemnified parties who are defendants in such action) unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. In the absence of such an election by an indemnifying party within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice to assume the defense of such an action or, in the event of a failure to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable period of time, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Sections 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representatives, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) Subject to Section 6(c), if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims,
Contribution
 
damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Operating Partnership and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Operating Partnership and the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Operating Partnership or the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Operating Partnership, the Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Operating Partnership or the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Operating Partnership or the Company, as the case may be. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number of Debt Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto, and not joint.
Schedule A
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers or other representatives of the Operating Partnership or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Operating Partnership or the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
SECTION 9. .
Termination of Agreement
(a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Operating Partnership and the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, any Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Operating Partnership or the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or the Pacific Exchange, or if trading generally on the NYSE Amex Equities or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either U.S. Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General.
(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities.
 
 
SECTION 10. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters.
(a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, then the Representatives or the Operating Partnership and the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10
.

(i) The Operating Partnership has been duly formed and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(ii) The Operating Partnership has the limited partnership power and limited partnership authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package and to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Debt Securities and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
(iii) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(iv) The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package and to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantee and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
(v) The execution and delivery by the Operating Partnership and the Company of the Purchase Agreement and the consummation by the Operating Partnership and the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities, will not conflict with the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company, the Certificate of Limited Partnership or the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership.
(vi) The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Operating Partnership and the Company.
(vii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Operating Partnership and the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Operating Partnership and the Company, enforceable against each of the Operating Partnership and the Company in accordance with its terms. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.
(viii) The Debt Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Operating Partnership, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Operating Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Operating Partnership entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Operating Partnership in accordance with their terms.
(ix) The Guarantee has been duly authorized by the Company and when the Debt Securities are issued and delivered by the Operating Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Guarantee will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
 
 
(x) The Prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses have each been filed with the Commission within the time period required by Rule 424 or Rule 433, as the case may be, of the 1933 Act Regulations.
(xi) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of their respective effective or issue dates, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations, except that in each case we do not express any opinion as to the financial statements and schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, or the exhibits thereto, and, except to the extent expressly stated in paragraphs (xii), (xiii) and (xiv), we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
(xii) The statements under the captions "Description of Notes" other than "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form", "Secondary Market Trading" and "Procedures May Change" and "Description of Plum Creek Operating Partnership Debt Securities" in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (it being understood that the Disclosure Package shall be considered as a whole taking into account that the Final Term Sheet supplies information that was omitted in the statements made under such captions), insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Indenture and the Securities, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
(xiii) The statements in the Registration Statement under the caption "Indemnification of Directors and Officers", insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the laws referred to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
(xiv) Although the discussion in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package under the caption "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax considerations related to the United States federal income taxation of the Company, such discussion, although general in nature, constitutes in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income taxation of the Company as a real estate investment trust.
[This will be given in a separate opinion]
(xv) No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required for, the execution or delivery of the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities by the Operating Partnership or the Company or the consummation by the Operating Partnership or the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby.

(xvii) Under current United States Federal income tax law, commencing with the Company's tax year that ended on December 31, 1999, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and the Company's proposed method of operation will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
[This will be given in a separate opinion]
(xviii) Commencing with the period from the tax year that ended on December 31, 1999 up to the Closing Time, the Operating Partnership has been properly treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a disregarded entity or as a partnership and not as a corporation or as an association or a publicly traded partnership subject to tax as a corporation.
[This will be given in a separate opinion]
Registration Statement on Form S-3 Nos. 333-158775 and 333-158775-01 became effective under the 1933 Act on April 24, 2009 and we have been orally advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to the best of our knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission.
In addition, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of each of the Operating Partnership and the Company, counsel for the Operating Partnership and the Company, representatives of the independent accountants of the Operating Partnership and the Company and you and your counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package and related matters were discussed. We did not participate in the preparation of the Incorporated Documents but have, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Operating Partnership and the Company with officers and other representatives of the Operating Partnership and the Company. Although we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package and have made no independent check verification thereof (except to the limited extent referred to in paragraphs (xii), (xiii) and (xiv) above), on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that (1) the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, at any Effective Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (2) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (when considered together with the Prospectus), as of the date of the Prospectus, as of the date of the amended or supplemented prospectus or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (3) the Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).
 
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, the Operating Partnership and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).
 
 
Exhibit B
(i) The Operating Partnership is qualified as a foreign limited partnership and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(ii) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(iii) Each Subsidiary has been duly incorporated or formed and is validly or legally existing as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are free and clear of any preemptive rights or any similar rights arising under the laws of their respective jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and, to the best of my knowledge, are owned by the Company directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of all consensual liens, encumbrances, equities or claims.
(iv) The statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 under the caption "Federal and State Regulations," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the laws referred to therein, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
(v) Each of the Incorporated Documents, when it was filed, appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations, except that I do not express any opinion as to the financial statements and related notes and schedules and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom or the exhibits thereto.
(vi) To my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Operating Partnership or the Company is a party or to which any property of the Operating Partnership or the Company is subject that are required to be disclosed in the Prospectus pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K of the 1933 Act Regulations that are not so disclosed.
 
 
(vii) Except for such noncompliance with, or failure to receive or comply with the terms of permits, licenses or other approvals required under, applicable Environmental Laws that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or except as otherwise set forth in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (a) are in compliance with any and all applicable Environmental Laws, (b) have received all permits, licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses, and (c) are in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval.
(viii) To my knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not described as required.
(ix) All descriptions in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its subsidiaries are a party are accurate in all material respects. To the best of my knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if any of the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply does not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of such ratings event).
"Capital Stock" means, with respect to any specified Person, any and all shares, interests, participations, or other equivalents (however designated, whether voting or non-voting), including partnership interests, whether general or limited, in the equity of such Person, whether outstanding on the date hereof or issued hereafter, including, without limitation, all common stock, preferred stock and units.

(iii) the Issuer or the Guarantor consolidates with, or merges with or into, any "person" (as such term is used for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable), or any "person" consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Issuer or the Guarantor, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or such other "person" is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares or units of the Voting Stock of the Issuer or the Guarantor outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving "person" immediately after giving effect to such transaction;

, that neither:
provided, however
(x) the pro rata distribution by the Guarantor to its shareholders of Capital Stock of the Issuer or of any of the Guarantor's other Subsidiaries; nor
(y) the replacement of Plum Creek Timber I, L.L.C. (or of a successor general partner) with a Subsidiary of the Guarantor as the general partner of the Issuer;
shall, in and of itself, constitute a Change of Control for purposes of this definition.
"Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event.
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Guarantor's Board of Directors who (1) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Notes were initially issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Guarantor in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
 
 
"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's) and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P), and the equivalent investment grade rating from any replacement rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Issuer under the circumstances permitting the Issuer to select a replacement rating agency and in the manner for selecting a replacement rating agency, in each case as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agencies."
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (or any successor).
"Rating Agencies" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Issuer's or the Guarantor's control, the Issuer may appoint another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be, provided that the Issuer delivers written notice of such appointment to the Trustee.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (or any successor).
"Voting Stock" of any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such "person" that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors, managers or trustees of such "person," as applicable.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be able to enter into a sale and lease-back transaction without being required to apply the net proceeds or Attributable Debt as required above if, after giving effect to such transaction, including any concurrent repayment of Secured Debt, the sum of (A) the total amount of all Secured Debt with which the Notes are not at least equally and ratably secured and (B) the greater of the total net proceeds or Attributable Debt of all sale and lease-back transactions entered into after the date of the Indenture (other than as permitted by clause (b) of this Section 18), would not exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets at the end of the Issuer's most recent fiscal quarter.

Interest on this Note payable on an Interest Payment Date will accrue from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly made available for payment, or from and including November 15, 2010 if no interest has been paid or duly made available for payment, to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
CEDE & CO.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture (as defined on the reverse hereof).
 
The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly made available for payment on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Holder in which name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered in the Security register at the close of business on the "Regular Record Date" for such payment, which shall be March 1 or September 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (regardless of whether such day is a Business Day (as defined below)). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly made available for payment shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date, and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a subsequent "Special Record Date" for the payment of such defaulted interest (which shall be not more than 5 Business Days prior to the date of the payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of the Notes not less than 15 calendar days preceding such subsequent Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment required to be made on such date will, instead, be made on the next Business Day with the same force and effect as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of senior debt securities of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2005 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer and Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc., as guarantor (the "Guarantor"), to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the series of Securities of which this Note is a part), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, and all modifications and amendments and indentures supplemental thereto relating to the Notes, made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties, and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are authenticated and delivered. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may accrue interest (if any) at different rates or formulas and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of Securities designated as the "4.70% Notes due 2021" (collectively, the "Notes") of the Issuer, limited (except as permitted under the Indenture) in aggregate principal amount to $575,000,000.
Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor.
The Issuer may redeem this Note, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the option of the Issuer, at a price equal to the sum of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, accrued but unpaid interest on those Notes to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption Date"), and, unless the Notes are redeemed on or after December 15, 2020, the Make-Whole Amount, if any, as defined below (the "Redemption Price"); , , that interest installments due on an Interest Payment Date which is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holder hereof (or one or more predecessor Notes) as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date preceding such Interest Payment Date.
provided
however
If notice has been given as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of this Note or any part thereof called for redemption shall have been made available on the Redemption Date, this Note or such part thereof will cease to bear interest on the Redemption Date referred to in such notice and the only right of the Holder will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price. Notice of any optional redemption of any Notes will be given to the Holder hereof (in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture), not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date. The notice of redemption will specify, among other things, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof and otherwise having the same terms and provisions as this Note shall be issued by the Issuer in the name of the Holder hereof upon the presentation and surrender hereof.
"" means, in connection with any optional redemption, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the date of such redemption of each dollar of principal being
Make-Whole Amount
redeemed and the amount of interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, that would have been payable in respect of each such dollar if such redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate, determined on the third Business Day preceding the date notice of such redemption is given, from the respective dates on which such principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption had not been made, to the date of redemption, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed.
"" means 0.35% plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the most recent Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity, rounded to the nearest month, corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the redemption date of the Notes being redeemed. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding each of such relevant periods to the nearest month. For the purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount shall be used. If the format or content of the Statistical Release changes in a manner that precludes determination of the Treasury yield in the above manner, then the Treasury yield shall be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as reasonably determined by the Issuer.
Reinvestment Rate
"" means the statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which reports yields on actively traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any required determination under the indenture, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated by the Issuer.
Statistical Release
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined below), unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes in accordance with the redemption terms as set forth herein, the Issuer shall be required to make an irrevocable offer to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000, provided any remaining principal amount resulting from a partial redemption is at least $2,000) of such Holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on a Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as applicable to receive interest due on the related Interest Payment Date.
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Issuer shall mail to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
On the Repurchase Date in respect of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Issuer shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Issuer shall not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for such Notes, and the Trustee, upon the execution and delivery by the Issuer of such Notes, will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of a Note tendered in part for repurchase a new Note equal in principal amount to any unrepurchased portion of such tendered Notes; provided that each new Note will be in a denomination of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
"" means that on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by each of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; and (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by the Issuer or the Guarantor to effect a Change of Control, the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if any of the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply does not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of such ratings event).
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event

provided, however
(iii) the Issuer or the Guarantor consolidates with, or merges with or into, any "person" (as such term is used for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, whether or not applicable), or any "person" consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Issuer or the Guarantor, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or such other "person" is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares or units of the Voting Stock of the Issuer or the Guarantor outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving "person" immediately after giving effect to such transaction;

(y) the replacement of Plum Creek Timber I, L.L.C. (or of a successor general partner) with a Subsidiary of the Guarantor as the general partner of the Issuer;

Change of Control Repurchase Event

Company, Inc. Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), and Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with Partnership, the "Issuers"), in connection with the public offering of $575,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Partnership's 4.70% Notes due 2021 (the "Debt Securities"), guaranteed by the Company (the "Guarantee" and, together with the Debt Securities, the "Securities"), issuable pursuant to an indenture dated November 14, 2005 (the "Indenture"), among the Partnership, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Issuers entered into a Purchase Agreement, dated November 8, 2010 (the "Purchase Agreement"), with Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and RBS Securities Inc., as representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale by the Issuers to the Underwriters of the Securities.
This opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:

We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Issuers and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Issuers and others, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Partnership and the Company, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all

requisite action, corporate or other, and the execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have also assumed that the execution and delivery by the Partnership and the Company of the Indenture, the Debt Securities and the Guarantees, as applicable, and the performance by the Partnership and the Company of their respective obligations thereunder, as applicable, did not, do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Partnership or the Company or any of their respective properties is subject, (ii) any law, rule, or regulation to which the Partnership or the Company or any of their properties is subject, (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with any governmental authority. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Issuers and others and of public officials.
The opinions set forth below are subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
(a) the validity or enforcement of any agreements or instruments may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(b) we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on each of the Securities or any transactions contemplated thereby;
(c) we do not express any opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification or contribution that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); and
(d) to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of any agreement or instrument, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law 5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction.

Our opinions set forth herein are limited to Delaware partnership law, the Delaware corporate law and the laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are applicable to transactions of the type covered by the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such non-opined-on law on the opinions herein which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Debt Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Partnership, and when duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Debt Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Partnership entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Partnership in accordance with their terms.
2. The Guarantee has been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when the Debt Securities are issued and delivered by the Partnership against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture, the Guarantee will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We also hereby consent to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof unless otherwise expressly stated, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes in the facts stated or assumed herein or of any subsequent changes in applicable law.
Very truly yours,
