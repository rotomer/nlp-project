Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. Reports Results for Second Quarter 2012
SEATTLE
- Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (NYSE: PCL) today announced second quarter earnings of $36 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, on revenues of $294 million. Earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $44 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, on revenues of $284 million.
Earnings for the first six months of 2012 were $65 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, on revenues of $631 million. Earnings for the first six months of 2011 were $82 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, on revenues of $559 million.
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure of operating performance, for the first six months of 2012 was $234 million, up from $209 million in the same period of 2011. The company ended the quarter with $260 million in cash and cash equivalents. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and cash flow from operations is provided as an attachment to this release.
Earnings in our timber and manufacturing businesses improved over the past year, said Rick Holley, Plum Creek's president and chief executive officer. Improving demand for our lumber and panels drove a $4 million improvement in our Manufacturing segment's second quarter profit compared to 2011. In our resources segments, higher harvest volumes, supplemented by volume from our recent timber deed acquisition, helped drive $8 million of profit growth and a $15 million increase in adjusted EBITDA. In our Real Estate segment, last year's second quarter sales were anchored by a couple of large conservation transactions making for a challenging comparison. However, our Real Estate segment revenues for this second quarter of $47 million were a bit higher than we initially anticipated. We continue to be on track to grow our adjusted EBITDA by approximately $50 million this year.
Review of Operations
The Northern Resources segment reported operating income of $4 million for the quarter, up $1 million from the second quarter of 2011. As expected, good harvesting conditions throughout much of the quarter allowed the company to bring more timber to market than the previous year. The sawlog harvest increased approximately 160,000 tons, or 34 percent, and the pulpwood harvest increased approximately 70,000 tons, or 29 percent. Sawlog prices of $71 per ton approximated second quarter of 2011 levels. Average pulpwood prices of $42 per ton were about $2 per ton higher than the same period of 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
Operating income in the Southern Resources segment was $22 million, an increase of $7 million from the $15 million reported during the second quarter of 2011. Both sawlog and pulpwood prices were slightly higher (approximately $1 per ton) than the levels reported for the second quarter of 2011. As planned, harvest volumes in 2012 were higher than those in the same period of 2011. The company's harvest continues to emphasize pulpwood and smaller diameter sawlogs to maximize long-term value of the forest. Pulpwood volumes were up 341,000 tons, or 21%, higher compared to the second quarter of 2011. The sawlog harvest was 406,000 tons, or 36%, higher, than the same period of 2011.
The Real Estate segment reported total revenue of $47 million and operating income of $29 million. Second quarter 2011 Real Estate segment revenue was $79 million, primarily consisting of $62 million of conservation transactions in the South. The second quarter 2011 operating income was $50 million. The 2012 sales consisted of $37 million of smaller rural land sales across the company's holdings and the completion of a $10 million conservation easement in the state of Maine as part of its Moosehead Lake Concept Plan.
The Manufacturing segment reported $9 million of operating income for the second quarter, compared to the $5 million operating income reported for the second quarter of 2011. Profitability in each of the product lines improved on higher prices and sales volumes. Sales volumes for plywood and medium density fiberboard (MDF) increased 15 percent and 22 percent respectively. Lumber sales volume increased 2 percent and lumber prices increased approximately 4 percent. Plywood prices increased 7 percent and MDF prices improved 2 percent.
Outlook
Business conditions in most of the company's business segments have improved slowly over the past year. The company expects a slow pace of recovery to continue through the remainder of the year.
The company expects its full-year harvest to approximate 17.5 million tons, including approximately 700,000 tons from our recent timber deed acquisition. This is at the high end of the company's original harvest projection of 16.5 to 17.5 million tons for 2012. The increase is comprised of pulpwood, primarily the result of increased yields from the thinning of young timber stands.
During the third quarter, harvests in the Northern Resources segment are expected to increase seasonally from their second quarter low while the Southern harvest is expected to be similar to the second quarter's level.
Third quarter Real Estate segment sales are expected to be between $90 million and $100 million. The company expects full-year Real Estate segment sales to be between $275 million and $325 million.
 
Manufacturing results are expected to decline slightly from the second quarter's level.
Our operations are performing well and we look forward to continued growth in the second half of the year, but believe a stronger recovery in the nation's economy is more likely in 2013, continued Holley. We're maintaining our earnings guidance for the year at $1.00 to $1.25 per share. We expect to report third quarter earnings between $0.32 and $0.37 per share.
We continue to manage the company to maximize the long-term value of our shareholders' investment. To accomplish this, nothing is more important than continued disciplined capital allocation. We will continue to evaluate all our opportunities to maximize shareholder value through share repurchase, debt reduction, or timberland acquisition; whatever creates the most value for our shareholders, concluded

Segment Data - Adjusted EBITDA
Reconciliation of Operating Income and Net Cash
Provided by Operating Activities
(Unaudited)
We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations, excluding equity method earnings, and before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and basis in lands sold. Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components of our consolidated financial statements.
 
We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period, and each business segments contribution to that performance, by eliminating non-cash charges to earnings, which can vary significantly by business segment. These non-cash charges include timber depletion, depreciation of fixed assets and the basis in lands sold. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we believe it is useful in measuring our ability to generate cash. In addition, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used by investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess our financial performance.
 
A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash from operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP performance and liquidity measures, is provided in the following schedules:
