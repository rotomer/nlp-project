EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 PRICELINE.COM REPORTS 3RD QUARTER 2002 RESULTS HOTEL BOOKED OFFERS CLIMB 37% COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED NORWALK, Conn., November 5, 2002 . . . Priceline.com(R) (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported a 3rd quarter 2002 loss of $24.3 million, or $0.11 per share, which includes non-cash charges of $24.2 million relating to impairment of the Company's investments in offshore licensees. On a pro forma basis, the Company reported net income of $400,000 ($0.00 per share) on revenues of $240 million. The Company's pro forma EPS results were in line with guidance provided in July. By comparison, in the 3rd quarter 2001 priceline.com had a GAAP net loss of $3.6 million, or $0.02 per share, on revenue of $302 million, and pro forma EPS of $0.03. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, priceline.com had a GAAP net loss of $0.06 per share and pro forma EPS of $0.05, compared to a GAAP net loss of $0.07 per share and pro forma EPS of $0.06 for the first nine months of 2001. Priceline.com reported pro forma EBITDA for the 3rd quarter 2002 of $4.5 million, compared to $8.4 million in the 3rd quarter 2001. Pro forma net income and pro forma EBITDA are stated before restructuring, special and severance charges, impairment of investments in offshore licensees, stock-based compensation, option payroll tax and preferred stock dividend. (The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with the Company's financial results under GAAP). EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Gross profit for the 3rd quarter 2002 was $37.7 million, compared to $50.4 million in the 3rd quarter 2001. Priceline.com ended the quarter with $152.5 million in cash and short-term investments. Quarter-over-quarter cash reductions resulted primarily from the repurchase of 5.4 million shares of priceline.com common stock in the quarter and changes in working capital associated with reduced sales of airline tickets. Priceline.com has no outstanding debt. "The 3rd quarter 2002 was another strong quarter for priceline.com's hotel service," said priceline.com President and Co-CEO Jeffery H. Boyd. Priceline.com's hotel booked offers grew 37 percent year over year, with sales of more than 1 million room nights. Priceline.com's customer base grew to 15.4 million and repeat business for the quarter came in at a record 67.4 percent. (Repeat business is defined as the number of total unique purchase offers coming from repeat customers divided by the number of total unique purchase offers). Priceline.com's 3rd quarter 2002 results reflect continued difficult conditions in the airline industry, which has been affected by heavy discounting of retail fares and weak results in September attributable, in part, to lower levels of travel around the anniversary of September 11th. "Amid increasing evidence that the growth of published discounting on the Internet is doing more harm (by reducing yields) than good (in the form of lower distribution costs), we continue to believe that our Name Your Own Pricesm model provides the best non-dilutive model for airlines to move unsold inventory and increase load factors and revenues," said Mr. Boyd. "However, given the protracted nature of the airline industry's difficulties, we will continue to focus our resources on our hotel and vacation package businesses and on making discounted retail fares available to our customers through Lowestfare.com(R)." In conjunction with that focus, priceline.com said it will reduce operating expenses through a repositioning of its non-travel businesses and a reduction in headcount and other expenses. Priceline.com's car service
will continue to provide new- and used-car buying information and guaranteed quote requests through Autobytel and other marketing partners. Priceline.com's telecommunications service will continue to offer long distance calling plans, but will no longer sell Name Your Own price calling minutes. PricelineMortgage's current product lineup will continue to be offered on the Company's Web site. "These steps are designed to reduce our operating expenses and allow for a greater focus of our resources on our key travel businesses," said Mr. Boyd. As part of this business re-focusing, priceline.com said it will reduce its workforce by approximately 65 positions. Also today, priceline.com reported progress on its travel initiatives. o HOTELS. Priceline.com's hotel service benefited from the launch in August of a revised Web path and a Best-Price guarantee. Hotel supplier participation grew to over 8,500 hotels in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. With industry-leading pricing and the continued growth in online hotel bookings, priceline.com is well-positioned to benefit from more aggressive advertising and promotion of this product. o RETAIL OFFERINGS. As disclosed at the end of the previous quarter, priceline.com is in the process of offering customers retail travel products through its own site and through Lowestfare.com. (Priceline.com acquired the Lowestfare.com domain name and trademarks earlier this year). The first phase of retail air and hotel product offerings on Lowestfare.com is expected to be up and running in the next few weeks. Progress also has been made on the integration of Lowestfare.com retail offerings on priceline.com, so that customers who aren't successful with their priceline.com bids are presented with the opportunity to purchase a retail product. A retail hotel room offering is currently available on a test basis and a retail airline ticket offering is scheduled for launch before year-end. o VACATION PACKAGES. Today, priceline.com and Lowestfare.com announced a marketing alliance with GOGO Worldwide Vacations. GOGO is one of the oldest and biggest leisure travel wholesalers to the travel agent market. GOGO offers the largest vacation package lineup in the industry - over 200 destinations on four continents, including popular spots like the Caribbean, Mexico, Europe, Central America, the South Pacific, the Bahamas, Las Vegas and Hawaii. Starting later this quarter, Lowestfare.com customers will be able to select from GOGO's lineup of money-saving packages. Integration of GOGO packages within priceline.com is scheduled for implementation early next year. Priceline.com also will continue to expand its own Name Your Own Price vacation package offerings. "We believe that priceline.com already has the two most important ingredients in place to make our travel growth strategy a success," said priceline.com Chairman and Co-CEO Richard S. Braddock. "One is our industry leading travel brand and the other is our customer franchise, which provides a steady average stream of 4 million visitors who come to priceline.com each month looking to make travel purchases." Looking forward, Mr. Braddock said, "Revenue in October was approximately $72.5 million, a slight improvement from September, but we expect seasonal decreases in revenue during November and December. Also, the staff reductions announced today will result in 4th quarter restructuring and other charges, ranging from $4 million to $5 million. We expect pro forma EPS in the 4th quarter will range from a loss of $0.02 per share to break-even. Looking forward to 2003, we expect to return to profitability by the second quarter of 2003 and we expect 2003 full-year pro forma EPS to exceed 2002 pro forma EPS. We will give more specific guidance when we announce full-year 2002 results."
