EXHIBIT INDEX EXHIBIT NO. DESCRIPTION ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release (which includes a financial and statistical supplement and related information) issued by priceline.com Incorporated on February 10, 2003 relating to its 4th quarter ended December 31, 2002 earnings.

Exhibit 99.1 PRICELINE.COM REPORTS 4TH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2002 RESULTS 2002 HOTEL ROOM NIGHTS SOLD INCREASE 47 PERCENT OVER 2001 NEW ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS VALUE AND QUALITY OF HOTEL PRODUCT NORWALK, Conn., February 10, 2003 -- Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported a 4th quarter 2002 GAAP net loss of $7.4 million, or $0.03 per share, after giving effect to previously announced restructuring and other charges. On a pro forma basis, the Company reported a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.01 per share, on revenues of $197.3 million for the 4th quarter, which was consistent with Company guidance provided in November. By comparison, in the 4th quarter 2001, priceline.com had a GAAP net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.01 per share, on revenue of $235.3 million, and pro forma net income of $3.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Priceline.com reported pro forma EBITDA for the 4th quarter 2002 of $1.2 million compared with $6.2 million for the 4th quarter of 2001. Pro forma financial information is stated before restructuring, special and severance charges, stock-based compensation and option payroll tax, impairment of certain investments and preferred stock dividends. (The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with the Company's financial results under GAAP). EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Priceline.com ended 2002 with $149.6 million in cash and short-term investments. Priceline.com has no debt. Priceline.com reported growth in its key customer metrics. The Company's customer base grew to 16.1 million, with repeat business for the quarter registering 66.3 percent. (Repeat business is defined as the number of total unique purchase offers coming from repeat customers divided by the number of total unique purchase offers). For full-year 2002, priceline.com had revenue of $1 billion, compared with $1.2 billion during 2001. On a GAAP basis, priceline.com had a full-year 2002 net loss of $21.5 million, or $0.09 per share, which included a $24.2 million non-cash charge for the impairment of certain Company investments. During 2001, priceline had a GAAP net loss of $15.9 million, or $0.08 per share. On a pro forma basis, priceline.com had full-year 2002 net income of $9.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to pro forma net income of $15.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share during 2001. Full-year 2002 pro forma EBITDA was $24.5 million, compared to $24.4 million during 2001. "Priceline.com's 4th quarter results came in consistent with our November guidance despite continued deterioration in travel market conditions which we believe are generally tied to the potential for war in the Middle East, a weakened airline industry and economic uncertainty," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. "Continued weakness in opaque airline ticket sales was partially offset by another strong quarter for our hotel business, which sold almost 1 million hotel room nights. In total, hotel room nights sold were up 47 percent in 2002 compared to the previous year. On a quarterly basis, hotel room nights sold grew 22 percent compared to 4th quarter 2001." Mr. Boyd continued, "In 2002, priceline.com made good progress in building its hotel, packages and retail travel businesses, thereby reducing its reliance on opaque airline ticket sales. In the fourth quarter of 2002, 63% of all booked customer offers were derived from services other than the Company's opaque airline product, up from 47% in the fourth quarter of 2001. We significantly increased our investment in the hotel business with a major TV campaign launched in January featuring the quality of our hotel inventory and our delivery of up to 40 percent savings compared to leading online sites. The early results are encouraging with quarter-to-date room night sales up over 30% compared to the same period last year."
Today, priceline.com also reported specific progress on travel initiatives that included expansion of its hotel service and the integration of Name Your Own Pricesm and retail travel services: o HOTELS. Priceline.com reported that it now has more than 9,000 name-brand hotel properties participating in its hotel program, covering the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. All of the major chains work with priceline.com, enabling the Company to offer its customers top-of-the-line hotel rooms. o RETAIL OFFERINGS. During the 4th quarter, priceline.com began offering airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and vacation packages at competitive, disclosed retail prices through Lowestfare.com. (Priceline.com acquired the Lowestfare.com domain name and trademarks in 2002). In addition to the major full-service airlines, Lowestfare.com sells seats on popular discount airlines. Priceline.com also began to offer unbound priceline.com customers the opportunity to purchase retail products from Lowestfare.com. In the 4th quarter, priceline.com achieved $10.4 million in total retail travel bookings. Gross retail bookings are not recognized as revenue because Priceline does not act as merchant in a retail transaction. Priceline's revenue recognition is limited to the fees and commissions it earns as an agent. o PACKAGES. During the 4th quarter, Lowestfare.com began selling fixed-price air/hotel packages provided by GOGO Worldwide Vacations. Priceline.com is scheduled to integrate a retail package product into its own service in 2003. "We believe that our hotel service is clearly a best-of-breed product that delivers high quality at lower prices than the other leading online hotel booking services," said Mr. Boyd. "We will market and advertise this message aggressively to consumers throughout 2003. Priceline.com and Lowestfare.com have also taken and will continue to take the steps necessary to furnish customers with one-stop solutions that save them time and money on their travel purchases. We expect airline industry conditions will continue to put pressure on our opaque airline ticket sales. However, we believe that total travel bookings and revenue in our other businesses - hotels, packages, rental cars and retail offerings - will continue to grow. We expect to reach an inflection point sometime in the second half of this year, at which point the year-over-year decreases in our opaque airline ticket sales will be overtaken by the size and corresponding growth rates of our collective other businesses. We believe that progress in these businesses position priceline.com for improved operating results and long-term growth." Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "Total revenue for the month of January was approximately $62 million, reflecting continued weakness in opaque airline ticket sales, offset partially by continued strong hotel performance. Excluding the effects of a potential war in the Middle East or terrorist events that might negatively impact the travel industry, we expect revenue in February and March will exceed that of January, and we expect pro forma results in the 1st quarter 2003 will range from break-even to a loss of $0.02 per share. Incorporated into that guidance is the Company's decision to continue to invest in advertising for our hotel service during the quarter. On the same assumptions, we continue to expect that priceline.com will return to profitability by the 2nd quarter of this year and we expect to have 2003 full-year pro forma EPS that will exceed that of 2002." ABOUT PRICELINE.COM Priceline.com offers products for sale in two categories: a travel service that offers leisure airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, vacation packages and cruises; and a personal finance service that offers home mortgages, refinancing and home equity loans through an independent licensee. Priceline.com also owns the Internet domain names and trademarks of LowestFare.com, another Web-based travel site.

USE OF PRO FORMA RESULTS The Company believes that the presentation of pro forma results in this press release and the exhibits to this press release provides investors and analysts with useful supplementary information concerning the company's ongoing cash operating profits (or losses) and its cash operating margins.
