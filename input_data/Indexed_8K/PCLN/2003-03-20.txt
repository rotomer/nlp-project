ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On March 20, 2003, priceline.com Incorporated ("PRICELINE.COM") announced that, in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with Marriott International, Inc. ("MARRIOTT"), priceline.com issued Marriott warrants to purchase five million shares of priceline.com common stock, par value $0.008. The warrants, which are not transferable, are fully vested and will be exercisable no earlier than three years from the date of issuance (subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving priceline.com). The exercise price of the warrants will be the closing price of priceline.com's common stock at a pre-determined date in the future. As a result of the issuance of the warrants to Marriott, Priceline.com will incur a non-cash expense in the first quarter of 2003 of approximately 3 to 4 cents per share. Future quarterly financial results are expected to be unaffected by any additional charges associated with the issuance of the warrants to Marriott.
