A copy of priceline.com's consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 and consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2003 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

ITEM 9. REGISTRATION FD DISCLOSURE FURNISHED PURSUANT TO ITEM 12 DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On May 1, 2003, priceline.com Incorporated announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The attached press release contains forward-looking statements relating to priceline.com's performance during 2003. A more thorough discussion of certain factors which may affect priceline.com's operating results is included in priceline.com's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, and will also be included in priceline.com's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter of 2003. In accordance with the procedural guidance in Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216, the information in this report is being furnished under "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure" rather than under "Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." The information in this report shall not be treated as "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The attached press release contains two non-GAAP financial measures. For purposes of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). In the attached press release, priceline.com uses the non-GAAP measures of net loss excluding warrant costs and net loss per share excluding warrant costs and preferred stock dividends. Both "warrant costs" and "preferred stock dividends" are non-cash charges calculated in accordance with GAAP that appear as line items on
priceline.com's consolidated statement of operations for the 1st quarter 2003. The non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our 1st quarter 2003 financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe that net loss excluding warrant costs and net loss per share excluding preferred stock dividends and warrant costs provide useful information to investors by excluding two non-cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core operating results. Additionally, while this is the first fiscal quarter in which priceline.com is not separately reporting results on a "pro forma" basis, the company has, for transitional purposes, reported these two non-GAAP measures to facilitate comparison to 1st quarter 2003 guidance it had previously provided. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but are not a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. In the attached financial and statistical supplement, we have reconciled net loss excluding warrant costs and net loss per share excluding preferred stock dividends and warrant costs to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, net loss and net loss per share.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

PRICELINE.COM INCORPORATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNAUDITED)

EXHIBIT 99.2 PRICELINE.COM REPORTS 1st QUARTER 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS Hotel service sets all-time records - 1.2 MILLION ROOM NIGHTS SOLD - REVENUE UP 37% YEAR OVER YEAR AND 30% SEQUENTIALLY - 268,763 SEQUENTIAL INCREASE IN ROOM NIGHTS SOLD Priceline.com to seek stockholder approval for reverse stock split NORWALK, Conn., May 1, 2003 ... Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported a 1st quarter 2003 GAAP net loss of $8.0 million, or $0.04 per share, on revenues of $200.5 million. The $0.04 per share loss includes non-cash charges of approximately $6.9 million related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott Corporation and a preferred stock dividend. Excluding these non-cash charges, priceline.com would have recorded a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.00 per share for the quarter. The First Call consensus earnings estimate on this basis was for a loss of $0.01 per share. The Company stated that 1st quarter results were primarily driven by record hotel sales, improved gross margins, expense management and improved results in its packages, retail and rental car businesses. By comparison, in the 1st quarter 2002, priceline.com had revenues of $261.9 million and GAAP net income of $3.9 million, or $0.02 per share. Beginning with the 1st quarter's results, priceline.com has enhanced its reporting of revenue and related cost of revenue to provide merchant, agency and other categories. Historical results have been presented to conform to the current period's reporting format. Priceline.com also is enhancing its disclosure of operating and statistical metrics to include gross bookings, which refers to the total dollar value of all travel products purchased by consumers, inclusive of taxes and fees. Finally, this is the first quarter in which priceline.com is not separately reporting its results on a "pro forma" basis, although the Company has provided the information above as to results before certain non-cash charges for transitional purposes to facilitate comparison to existing First Call estimates. During the 1st quarter 2003, priceline.com's gross profit was $33 million, compared to $42 million in the 1st quarter 2002. Gross margin for the 1st quarter was 16.5 percent, compared to 16 percent a year ago. In the 1st quarter 2003, priceline reported gross bookings of $248 million, compared to $307 million a year ago. Priceline.com ended the quarter with nearly $140 million in cash and short-term investments. The Company has no debt. "We are pleased to report a record quarter for priceline.com's hotel service," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. "Supported by a major advertising campaign, our hotel service sold 1.2 million room nights during the quarter, with hotel revenues increasing approximately 37 percent year over year and 30 percent sequentially. We believe that this increased growth is due to the fact that more leisure travelers are trying us and they see that priceline.com's hotel service delivers top-of-the-line hotel quality at savings that are up to 40 percent greater than those found on Expedia, Hotels.com and Travelocity." Mr. Boyd continued, "Our retail travel business, including the Lowestfare.com brand which we acquired last year, contributed $21 million in gross bookings this quarter, which is up $17 million over last year's 1st quarter and represents a 103 percent sequential increase. Improved margins in our opaque travel products and growth in contribution from retail sales resulted in a gross margin of 16.5 percent for the 1st quarter 2003, compared to 15.5 percent in the 4th quarter 2002 and 16 percent in the 1st quarter 2002. In total, despite the negative impact of the Iraq war on the nation's airlines and the broader travel industry, we are pleased that priceline.com still was able to deliver 1st quarter results that were comfortably within our pre-war guidance."
Priceline.com demonstrated strong consumer metrics for the 1st quarter 2003. The service added nearly 750,000 new customers, bringing its total customer base to 16.9 million. Repeat business for the quarter was 66.5 percent. (Repeat business is defined as the number of unique purchase offers coming from repeat customers divided by the number of total unique purchase offers). During the 1st quarter, priceline.com entered into a partnership with Travelweb LLC, the online travel service owned by Marriott International, Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, Starwood Hotels, Intercontinental Hotels Group and Pegasus Solutions, Inc. Under the agreement, Travelweb became the exclusive supplier of retail hotel rooms for Lowestfare.com. Priceline.com invested $8.5 million for an approximately 15 percent equity stake in Travelweb LLC and Mr. Boyd joined the Travelweb Board of Directors. In addition, the Company's supplier relationships were further strengthened and broadened during the quarter. Priceline.com signed a three-year extension of a marketing partnership with Marriott, under which priceline.com remains Marriott's preferred partner in the opaque travel market. Priceline.com also announced today that its Board of Directors had authorized the Company to seek stockholder approval for a reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of priceline.com's common stock at an exchange ratio ranging from one-for-six to one-for-nine shares. Priceline.com currently has approximately 230 million diluted shares outstanding with a market value in excess of $500 million. If approved by the stockholders and effected by the Board of Directors, the reverse split would have the effect of reducing the number of shares of priceline.com's outstanding common stock to between 37.5 million and 25 million respectively. "We believe this reverse split will expand investor interest in priceline.com, reduce transaction costs for trading our common stock, make our results more comparable to peer companies that have far fewer outstanding shares than we currently have, and allow priceline.com's earnings per share, on a post-split basis, to more precisely reflect the Company's operating results," said Mr. Boyd. Added Mr. Boyd, "With a well-recognized brand, no debt, a strong cash position and an attractive array of products, we believe that priceline.com is positioned to be a long-term winner in online travel. The share re-purchase program authorized by our Board of Directors remains in effect for priceline.com, Hutchison-Whampoa Ltd. and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., and all three companies are positioned to continue to repurchase priceline.com shares from time to time." Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We expect a profitable 2nd quarter driven primarily by strong hotel revenues (up 35 percent year-over-year in April), as well as results from packages, rental car and retail products. Revenues for April were approximately $68 million and we expect sequential seasonal improvements in May and June. We are targeting GAAP EPS of between $0.02 and $0.03 per share (pre-split) for the 2nd quarter. We continue to target a 25 percent-plus annual increase in hotel revenue for the remaining quarters of 2003, improved year-over-year bottom-line results and a return to top-line growth in gross bookings by year-end." The Company said that unrest in the Middle East, threats of terrorism and the outbreak of SARS continue to make forecasting a challenge and that adverse developments could affect actual results.
