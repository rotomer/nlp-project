EXHIBIT 99.1 PRICELINE.COM DECLARES 1-FOR-6 REVERSE STOCK SPLIT Priceline.com updates 2nd quarter 2003 financial guidance, earnings targets on a post-split basis NORWALK, Conn., June 16, 2003 . . . Priceline.com(R) Incorporated (Nasdaq: PCLN) announced today that it had effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of its common stock, par value $0.008 per share. The reverse stock split was effective at 12:01 a.m. this morning. As a result of the reverse stock split, each priceline.com stockholder will receive 1 new share of priceline.com common stock in exchange for every 6 old shares. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or "street name" will not be required to take any action to effect the exchange of their shares. Stockholders of record who hold share certificates will receive a letter of transmittal requesting that they surrender their old stock certificates for new stock certificates reflecting the adjusted number of shares as a result of the reverse stock split. Mellon Investor Services, LLC, priceline.com's transfer agent, will act as the exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange of stock certificates. Also today, priceline.com updated its 2nd quarter 2003 financial guidance. "Our previous pre-split guidance was for 2nd quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.03," said priceline.com Chief Financial Officer Robert J. Mylod, Jr. "On a post-split basis, this translates to earnings of between $0.12 to $0.18 per share, and we remain comfortable with estimates within that range." The average First Call consensus earnings estimate for the 2nd quarter 2003 was for net income of $3.6 million, which translates to $0.10 per share on a post-split basis. Priceline.com's reverse stock split will reduce the Company's shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 227 million to approximately 37.5 million. "Priceline.com has a well-recognized brand, no debt, a strong cash position and an attractive array of products," said priceline.com President and CEO Jeffery H. Boyd. "We believe priceline.com is well-positioned to be a long-term winner in online travel. We also believe that this reverse stock split enhances our position by expanding investor interest, reducing transaction costs for trading our stock, making our results more comparable to peer companies with far fewer outstanding shares, and allowing priceline.com's earnings per share on a post-split basis to more precisely reflect the Company's operating results."
