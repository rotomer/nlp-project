EXHIBIT 99.2 PRICELINE.COM REPORTS 2nd QUARTER 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS 2nd QUARTER NET INCOME IS $7.7 MILLION, OR $0.20 PER SHARE Hotel service sells record 1.5 million room nights; room nights sold up 38% year over year NORWALK, Conn., July 24, 2003 . . . Priceline.com(R) (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 2nd quarter 2003 net income of $7.7 million, or $0.20 per share, on revenues of $239.6 million. Gross travel bookings, which refers to the total dollar value (inclusive of taxes and fees) of all travel products purchased by consumers, for the 2nd quarter were $297.1 million. Priceline.com's 2nd quarter EPS exceeded First Call analyst consensus of $0.14 per share, and came in ahead of priceline.com's previously announced target range of $0.12 to $0.18 per share. By comparison, in the 2nd quarter 2002, priceline.com had net income of $6.3 million, or $0.16 per share, on revenues of $304.5 million. Priceline.com's gross margin for the 2nd quarter 2003 was 16.9 percent, compared to 15.8 percent a year ago and 16.5 percent for the 1st quarter 2003. Priceline.com ended the 2nd quarter 2003 with $149.2 million in cash and short-term investments. The Company has no debt. During the 2nd quarter, priceline.com effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock split. By the end of the 2nd quarter, priceline.com's customer base grew to 17.8 million, which represents growth of approximately 22 percent over the past year. Repeat business for the quarter was 67.1 percent. (Repeat business is defined as the number of unique purchase offers coming from repeat customers divided by the number of total unique purchase offers). "Priceline.com's stronger than expected 2nd quarter results were attributable to several factors, including strong hotel, rental car and package results, a stabilization of our airline tickets business bolstered by improved leisure travel demand and growing sales of retail tickets, and contribution from our mortgage business," said priceline.com President and Chief Executive Officer Jeffery H. Boyd. During the 2nd quarter, priceline.com sold approximately 1.5 million hotel room nights, adding sequentially approximately 270,000 additional room nights from the 1st quarter. Hotel unit sales increased approximately 38 percent year over year, an increase over the 35 percent year-over-year growth rate experienced in the 1st quarter. "We believe the growing popularity of our hotel product is due to the success of our marketing campaign and the superior room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners, which translates into savings that are better than those found on other leading travel sites, often by as much as 40 percent or more," said Mr. Boyd. Priceline.com's combined merchant and agency airline ticket gross bookings increased 16 percent sequentially in the 2nd quarter as the result of a slight sequential increase in opaque tickets sold and continued strong growth in retail ticket sales. The rental car business added over 192,000 rental car days sequentially in the 2nd quarter and unit sales were up 4 percent compared to 2nd quarter 2002. Package unit sales increased over 100 percent over last year's 2nd quarter. Finally, total agency (retail) bookings were $30 million in the 2nd quarter, up 44 percent sequentially and an increase of $26 million over 2nd quarter 2002. Priceline.com expects that growing retail bookings will be enhanced by its recent acquisition of Rentalcars.com and the offering of Travelweb LLC retail hotel inventory on Lowestfare.com, priceline.com's other retail site. "Retail bookings are growing as we add to our array of retail products and this trend, together with improved merchant margins, pushed priceline.com's total gross margins to a record 16.9 percent in the 2nd quarter," said Mr. Boyd. "Retail will continue to be an important part of our business, as it allows us to satisfy unbound Name Your Own Price(R) customers, offer a broad assortment of travel products when opaque inventories are constrained and appeal generally to a broader addressable consumer marketplace." The 2nd quarter 2003 benefited from $1.1 million of other income, which reflected a contribution from pricelinemortgage. That contribution was offset partially by early stage losses in Travelweb LLC, of which priceline.com is a part-owner. Pricelinemortgage had positive results in the quarter due to the continued attractive economic climate for refinancing, home equity loans and first-time mortgages. The mortgage
business, which priceline.com jointly owns with First Alliance Bank, enables consumers to choose from sample rates or set their own terms, and guarantees that customers will get the best publicly available rate. Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "Priceline.com's 3rd quarter got off to a strong start in July, buoyed by strong seasonal leisure travel demand. Due to the accelerating growth experienced in our hotel and rental car businesses so far this month, we expect to achieve July revenues of approximately $93 to $95 million. We also expect year-over-year growth in hotel unit sales in the 3rd quarter at least equal to the 38 percent experienced in the 2nd quarter and we expect year-over-year growth in rental car unit sales to exceed that 38 percent rate. We now anticipate top-line revenue growth for the 3rd quarter of approximately 5 percent year-over-year, with targeted net income per share of $0.20 to $0.22. This target exceeds the current First Call analyst consensus of $0.15 per share. Net income applicable to common stockholders will be reduced by a non-cash preferred stock dividend of an estimated $0.03 per share in the 3rd quarter. For the 4th quarter, we are targeting a year-over-year revenue increase of approximately 5-10 percent and EPS of $0.08 to $0.12 per share, which also is above First Call analyst consensus of $0.07 per share."
