For full-year 2003, priceline.com reported gross travel bookings of $1.1 billion, revenue of  $863.7 million and net income applicable to common stockholders of $10.4 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to a loss of $0.57 per share for 2002.  The Company ended 2003 with a balance of $268.0 million in cash and short-term investments.  During the 4 quarter, the Company invested $12.2 million to buy-back 690,000 shares of its common stock, which represents approximately two percent of the Company's outstanding common stock.

"Priceline.com's 4 quarter results were lifted by the successful launch of our new airline tickets service, which offers consumers the choice between disclosed itinerary fares and Name-Your-Own-Price savings, as well as strong results from our hotel, rental car and new vacation products," said Jeffery H. Boyd, priceline.com's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "The growth in total gross travel bookings and gross profit reflects a successful transition of our airline ticket business and a positive bottom-line financial result, before any significant benefit from new airline ticket advertising."
th
 
Mr. Boyd continued, "Priceline.com reported strong product metrics across its travel products.  For the 4 quarter, total merchant and agency hotel room nights sold increased 37% over the 4 quarter of 2002 and total merchant and agency rental car days increased 62%.  The decline of merchant and agency airline tickets sold slowed to 18% in the 4 quarter 2003 and represents a significant improvement over the first nine months of 2003, when the airline tickets decline was over 40% compared to the first nine months of 2002.  That trend has continued with current quarter-to-date total ticket sales running above last year's levels.  Air and hotel are benefiting from increasing package sales as a result of product improvements launched in the quarter."
th
th
th
Revenues for the 4 quarter were down year-over-year as the new air service increased the mix of retail ticket sales (which are reported for on a "net" basis as compared to Name- Your-Own-Pricesales, which are reported on a "gross" basis).  The Company noted that, commencing with the 4 quarter, it would begin disclosing total merchant and agency airline, hotel and rental car unit sales, reflecting the growing importance of agency unit sales.

4 Quarter Operating Highlights
th
 
 -        Priceline.com completes testing of its new airline ticketing service that gives customers a choice between picking their flights and airlines from a broad assortment of fares, or Naming Your Own Price for deeper savings.
 -        Priceline.com's hotel service passes the 10,000 participating hotels milestone.  The service offers top-quality hotel properties in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
 -        Priceline.com introduces an enhanced vacation packages service.  The service offers over 2,000 hotel properties and all-inclusive resorts.  The new vacation package service includes fixed pricing, more flight options and a last-minute weekender product offering flight time windows and a fast, easy booking process.
 -        Priceline.com signs William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy to star in a new ad campaign for its airline tickets service.
 -        Priceline.com adds a new look and feel to its Rentalcars.com site.  The new site offers cars at special retail rates and contains links to priceline.com's Name Your Own Price rental car service.  The 4 quarter growth in the number of rental car days sold over the 4 quarter 2002 was driven by an increase in both merchant and agency sales.

th
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd said, "We expect the first half of 2004 to benefit from continued positive results from our new airline ticket and vacation products.  We also believe that the new William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy advertising and continuation of our successful hotel ad campaign will contribute added momentum to the business.  Consequently, for the 1 quarter 2004, we are targeting:
st
 
 -        A 25% to 30% year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings,
 -        A 10% to 15% year-over-year increase in airline ticket  unit bookings,
 -        A 25% to 30% year-over-year increase in hotel room night unit bookings ,
 -        A 50% to 60% year-over-year increase in rental car day unit bookings,
 -        Revenues roughly equal to the same period last year,
 -        A gross margin of 18% to 20%,
 -        A 15% to 20% year-over-year increase in gross profit, and
 -        Net income per share of $0.06 to $0.10."
Mr. Boyd continued, "For the 2 quarter 2004, we are targeting a 25% to 30% year-over-year increase in gross travel bookings and net income per share of $0.22 to $0.30.  For the second half of 2004, we expect to generate meaningful year-over-year growth in gross travel bookings, gross profit dollars and net income."
