Insider Cheers & Jeers
 
"CHEERS to Priceline.com for beaming up Star Trek veterans William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy in a new, out-of-this-world commercial.  We just hope the ad's premise that Nimoy is replacing Shatner as the company's spokesman isn't true.  Keeping Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock together is only logical."
