Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On May 3, 2004, priceline.com Incorporated announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004.  A copy of priceline.com's press release announcing these financial results and certain other information is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
As set forth in more detail in the attached press release, for the 1 quarter 2004, priceline.com's revenues were $224.1 million and gross profit was $43.4 million.  Priceline.com reported net income for the 1st quarter 2004 of $5.1 million, or $0.13 per share.  Net Income applicable to common stockholders was $0.11 per share.
st
 
Priceline.com guided investors to the following targets:
 
net income per share in the 2 quarter 2004 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30, excluding the effects of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC, and stock based compensation and option payroll taxes;
 -

net income per share in the 3 quarter 2004, excluding the effects of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC, and stock based compensation and option payroll taxes, and the payment of a non-cash dividend on priceline.com's outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, to be roughly comparable with the 2 quarter 2004; and

net income per share in the 4 quarter 2004 of approximately $0.13 to $0.17, excluding the effects of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC, and stock based compensation and option payroll taxes.

th
 
Priceline.com noted that it had not finalized its purchase accounting allocations for the Travelweb acquisition, but that it was targeting acquisition related amortization expenses of approximately $1.5 million per quarter.  With respect to 2 quarter 2004 operating expenses, priceline.com announced that it expected advertising expenses of approximately $14.0 to $15.0 million, sales and marketing expenses of approximately $8.0 to $8.5 million, personnel costs of approximately $8.5 to $8.8 million, general and administrative expenses of approximately $4.0 million, information technology expenses of approximately $3.3 to $3.5 million, operating depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $2.4 to $2.5 million, interest income of approximately $400,000 and stock based compensation and option payroll taxes of approximately $200,000 to $500,000.

Net income per share excluding the effects of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC, and stock based compensation and option payroll taxes and, in the 3 quarter 2004, the effects of the payment of a non-cash dividend on priceline.com's Series B Preferred Stock, is a "non-GAAP financial measure," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that a forecast of net income per share that excludes non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense is useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because it enables a more meaningful comparison of priceline's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Priceline.com has provided a forecast of net income per share that also excludes the effects of stock based compensation, option payroll taxes and the effect of the issuance of preferred stock dividends.  Stock based compensation and preferred stock dividends are excluded because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in
rd
earnings per share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.  The presentation of this financial information should not to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
 
Priceline.com's targeted GAAP net income per share in the 2, 3 and 4 quarters of 2004, after giving effect to approximately $1.5 million of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC and $200,000 to $5000,000 of stock based compensation and option payroll taxes would be approximately $0.20 to $0.26 in the 2 and 3 quarter 2004 and $0.08 to $0.13 in the 4 quarter 2004.  Targeted GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2004 does not give effect to the issuance of stock dividends on priceline.com's Series B Preferred Stock, which are not estimable at this time.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
NORWALK, Conn., May 3, 2004 . . . Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) today reported 1 quarter 2004 operating and financial results and the acquisition of Travelweb.com, the online hotel service built by the nation's leading hotel brands.
st
 
.  Priceline's 1 quarter 2004 gross travel bookings, which refer to the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel products purchased by consumers, rose 46% year-over-year to $360.2 million.  Revenues were $224.1 million, a 12% increase over 1 quarter 2003.  Gross profit grew 31% to $43.4 million, compared to $33.0 million a year ago.
Operating and Financial Results
st
st
 
Net income for the 1 quarter 2004 was $5.1 million, or $0.13 per share.  Net income applicable to common stockholders was $0.11 per share inclusive of a non-cash preferred stock dividend of $772,000.  Priceline.com's net income of $0.13 per share exceeded First Call analyst consensus estimates of $0.08 per share.
st
 
"Priceline.com's expanding travel product lineup, which gives consumers more choices than ever before, and a new TV ad campaign, were the catalysts that propelled the Company to higher levels of growth in the 1 quarter," said priceline.com President and CEO Jeffery H. Boyd.  "With the new retail ticketing feature complementing our  option, we now have an airline ticketing service that can satisfy a much broader segment of the leisure travel market.  Consequently, our tickets sold in the quarter rose 28% year-over-year."

Mr. Boyd continued, "Having a retail air option also gives us an increased ability to cross-sell other products, such as a rental car, hotel room or vacation package.  In the 1 quarter, the growth of our packages business continued to accelerate, fueled by increased demand and product improvements launched in the 4 and 1 quarters.  This helped our non-air products to continue their growth trajectories.  We sold 1.7 million hotel room nights in the quarter, a 35% increase over the 1 quarter 2003.  With the addition of retail sales from Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com, rental car days sold for the quarter were 1.2 million, an 83% increase over a year ago."

.  Priceline.com also announced that it had acquired 71.4% of the equity interests in Travelweb.com, bringing its total ownership to 85.7%.   The purchase price for the interests acquired was $20.8 million; in addition, priceline.com will potentially pay an earn-out after 12 months of approximately 954,547 shares of priceline.com common stock to the selling hotel companies and Pegasus in the event certain performance goals are met.  Priceline also stated it had entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 14.3% outstanding equity interest held by InterContinental Hotels Group at a future date.
Travelweb Acquisition
 
Travelweb has supply agreements with more than 11,000 participating properties in the Travelweb system, including the brands of its founder hotels, Hilton, Hyatt, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriott, and Starwood, and has distribution agreements with a number of travel websites, including Orbitz.com.  Priceline.com also said today that Travelweb has settled outstanding litigation with Orbitz and that Travelweb will continue supplying Orbitz with
 
 
merchant hotel inventory through December 31, 2005 under the terms of a revised distribution agreement.
 
"The acquisition of Travelweb gives priceline.com a proprietary disclosed merchant hotel product to complement priceline.com's  hotel product, allowing us to quickly enhance a strategy that is working for us with airline tickets and car rentals," said Mr. Boyd.  "We intend to strengthen Travelweb's product offerings, build retail choice in hotels on priceline.com, build Travelweb's third-party distribution and leverage our combined capabilities in technology, supplier relations and marketing to drive operating efficiencies."

.  Looking forward, Mr. Boyd commented, "Priceline.com intends to  continue building retail choices into our travel products and building functionality to offer customers attractive additional products at the point of reservation.  Further, we have successfully tested and will imminently launch a new vacation package service that will give customers a choice between opaque and retail itineraries depending on their travel requirements and savings preferences.  With a growing topline and efficient cost structure, we are in a position to continue our investments in new products, distribution and marketing while delivering attractive growth in our bottom line earnings."
Forward Guidance
 
In terms of financial targets, Mr. Boyd said,  "We expect gross bookings, gross profit and net income to all benefit from the solid momentum established in the first quarter and we also expect to continue to make significant investments in our advertising and marketing initiatives throughout the remainder of the year.   Travelweb is expected to generate operating losses before acquisition related amortization expenses in the second quarter of approximately 2 cents per share as a result of transition related expenses.  We expect
 
Travelweb operating results to improve during the course of the second half of 2004.  In 2005 and beyond, we expect Travelweb to be meaningfully accretive to our earnings per share.   For the second quarter 2004, we are guiding investors to the following financial targets:
 
Year-over-year increase in total gross bookings of 44% - 50%,
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increases of 42%- 50% in airline ticket unit bookings, approximately 25% in hotel room night unit bookings and 50% - 60% in rental car day unit bookings,
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increase in revenue of approximately 5%,
 - 
                 
Year-over-year increase in gross profit of 25% - 30%, and
 - 
                 
Net income per share of $0.25 to $0.30, not including the effects of non-cash acquisition-related amortization expense associated with the Travelweb acquisition and stock based compensation and option payroll tax expense.
 - 
                 
 
For third quarter 2004, we expect total gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and net income per share to be roughly comparable to second quarter levels consistent with the normal seasonal pattern of our business and our intention to continue investment in product development and marketing.  We are currently targeting 4 quarter net income per share of $0.13 - $0.17, not including the effects of non-cash, acquisition-related amortization expense associated with the Travelweb acquisition and stock based compensation and option payroll tax expense."
