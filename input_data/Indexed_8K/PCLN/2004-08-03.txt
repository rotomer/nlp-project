Pro forma net income for the 2 quarter 2004 was $12.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share.  Pro forma gross profit and pro forma net income exclude the effects of non-cash amortization of acquisition expense (primarily associated with priceline.com's acquisition of a majority of the equity of Travelweb LLC) and pro forma net income further excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, option payroll tax expense and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.

Priceline.com reported strong 2 quarter 2004 growth across its travel products.  Airline ticket unit bookings grew 60% compared to a year ago, while hotel room night unit bookings grew 32%, and rental car day unit bookings grew 63%.  Unit bookings are inclusive of priceline.com's opaque Name Your Own Price products and its growing complement of retail travel products offered on priceline.com and through sister sites Travelweb.com, Lowestfare.com, Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com.  Unit bookings also include products sold as part of priceline.com's packaged vacations service.

"The expansion of priceline's product line to give our customers greater travel choices has contributed to improved topline results.  In addition, acquired businesses such as Travelweb, are performing well," said priceline's President and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffery H. Boyd.  "With a strong topline performance, priceline.com was able to deliver pro forma earnings growth of 63% year-over-year, despite increased investments in new products and advertising."
 
Operating Highlights
 
.  In May, priceline.com increased its ownership in the Travelweb.com retail hotel reservation Web site to 85.7%.  Phase I site improvements have been made on Travelweb.com and development is under way to make more extensive retail choices available to priceline.com customers through Travelweb.
 - 
                 
Travelweb.com acquisition
 
.  Priceline.com launched a new retail rental car search and booking tool on RentalCars.com in May.  This tool, which expands choice and should aid conversion and customer retention, is scheduled to be rolled out to other owned websites in the coming months.
 - 
                 
Expansion of rental car retail offerings
.  In the 2 quarter, priceline.com gave consumers even more ways to save on vacation packages.  In most instances, when customers pick a vacation destination, priceline.com gives them two options.  They can choose the exact hotel they want, as well as pick their flight times and itineraries.  Or, for deeper savings, they can let priceline.com pick the flights for them.  In all cases, customers see a final price before choosing their vacation and hotels come with full descriptions, maps and more.

"Now that priceline has a full suite of retail travel products, the next step is to optimize the offering of those products on priceline.com, particularly in hotels and rental cars," said Mr. Boyd.  "In the coming months we intend to enhance the presentation of retail choices to hotel and rental car customers and improve packaging and cross-sell offerings in all our product paths.  Based on our success with our new airline ticket and packages products, we believe these steps will significantly strengthen priceline.com's product offering and contribute to topline performance into 2005."
 
Forward Guidance
 
Looking forward, Mr. Boyd commented, "We intend to continue our investment in product offerings and advertising, including Travelweb, since those investments are clearly paying dividends and position us well for the future.  We expect priceline.com will continue to deliver solid earnings growth this year while positioning itself for continued growth in 2005 and beyond."

Information About Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Expressions of future goals and similar expressions including, without limitation, "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "intend," "does not currently expect," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "targets," or "continue," reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause priceline.com's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: adverse changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel products as the result of, among other things, terrorist attacks; adverse changes in priceline.com's relationships with airlines and other product and service providers including, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com system; the bankruptcy or insolvency of another major domestic airline; the effects of increased competition; systems-related failures and/or security breaches; priceline.com's ability to protect its intellectual property rights; losses by priceline.com and its licensees; final adjustments made in closing the quarter; legal and regulatory risks and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. For a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause priceline.com's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, please refer to priceline.com's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Pro forma gross profit excludes the effect of non-cash amortization of acquisition expense associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC.  Pro forma net income excludes the effects of non-cash amortization of acquisition expense (primarily associated with the acquisition of Travelweb LLC), stock based compensation, option payroll taxes and, when applicable, the payment of non-cash preferred stock dividends.  Pro forma net income and pro forma gross profit are "non-GAAP financial measures," as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.  Priceline.com believes that pro forma net income and pro forma gross profit that exclude non-cash amortization of acquisition expense are useful for investors to evaluate priceline.com's future on-going performance because they enable a more meaningful comparison of priceline.com's projected cash earnings and performance with its historical results from prior periods.  Stock based compensation and preferred stock dividends are excluded from pro forma net income because they do not impact cash earnings and are reflected in earnings per share through increased share counts.  Option payroll tax often shows volatility unrelated to operating results since the expense is driven primarily by option exercise activity and the market price of priceline.com's common stock.  The presentation of this financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States.  The attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles pro forma financial information with priceline.com's financial results under GAAP.
